# Domain Squatting Attack: Antifa.com Pointing to JoeBiden.com

It is the 2020 presidential election, democratic candidate Joe Biden is running against republican candidate Donald Trump. While many political movements are engaging the U.S. one of them which calls themselves "Antifa" (short for antifascist) participates in many violent demonstrations. Oddly during the election period the domain antifa.com begins to redirect to joebiden.com. This analysis explores the origins of this and tries to understand if this is a cyber/domain squatting attack and who are the actors participating in it.
