Slow_Loading_Webpages.txt: Archived video sections that took too long to load will be stored here.

privated_videos_Uri-Ms.txt: The URI-Ms for the private / deleted YouTube videos.
categorized_privated_videos_Uri-Ms.txt: Each URI-R is at the beginning of a section of URI-Ms that should belong to the same video. There are some exceptions, so check for the 'v' parameter.

## Scripts
ChromeDrivers: The web drivers used by the scripts.
ExtractURLs_live_account.py:  Gets the YouTube video URLs from a channel. I did not automate the scrolling, so this script requires the user to scroll the web page that is displayed.
ExtractURLs_archived_account.py: Gets the URI-Rs for the privated / deleted videos, when given a list of video section URI-Rs.
ExtractVideoURI-Ms.py: Gets the URI-Ms for the privated / deleted videos when given a list of video URI-Rs.
