8216,Sept. 28 2020 4:36 p.m.,Burning with Love for God: A Guide to the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,"As has been widely reported the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola as a basis for counsel and discernment.  Burning with Love for God: A Guide to the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius written by People of Praise members Paul DeCelles and Mary Frances Sparrow and published in 2016 was recently reviewed in the Journal of Jesuit Studies by Francis X. McAloon S.J. McAloon writes ""I recommend this unique yet wholly orthodox approach to the Spiritual Exercises. Those outside the charismatic community will benefit from reviewing the Spirtitual Exercises from this perspective.""¹ Burning with Love for God is addressed to all who want to “live and move and have their being as God’s friend” and presents the Spiritual Exercises as a proven method for growing in love and forging friendship with God.  The topics covered in the book which include discernment of spirits decision-making personal prayer and making meditations on the life of Christ are all taken up in a careful and clear way that represents the fruit of the authors’ patient scholarship and many years of experience as directors of the Spiritual Exercises. “Paul and Mary Frances have given us a wonderful and profound gift in this deep guide” said Craig Lent. Peter Smith the auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon offered this endorsement: ""Pope Francis has spoken many times about the importance of discernment of finding and following God’s will of discovering what the Holy Spirit is doing in our times . . . I hope many Christians will read this book learn from it how to love God more deeply and personally and go out into the world to follow Christ wherever he leads.” Burning with Love for God is available for order on Amazon.    ¹McAloon F.X.

6126,Sept. 24 2020 8:38 a.m.,The Three Last Words of Bill Kenney,Bill worked as a security guard at Visitation School for 17 years.. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Courtesy of Dorothy Kenney; Anne Kane; Robert Cunningham Photoresource. Editor's Note: This article was originally published on Nov. 3 2017. On a frigid Wednesday last December hundreds gathered for a funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul packing the center section of one of the largest churches in the United States. Some circled the downtown blocks near the cathedral looking for parking and eventually gave up and went home.Outside the mailman asked at the rectory what was going on and the hired motorcycle escort asked the funeral director how he’d gotten such a large event. As the gospel was read a man wearing a bandanna and carrying a backpack came in the side door and walked across the front of the cathedral. On a day with a high temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind chill well below zero he wore sandals with white socks and white pants. While the crowd stood in their pews he walked right up to the casket at the front of the church bent down and kissed it. Then he walked down the center aisle and out the door. Later as the casket was carried out of the cathedral 12th-grade girls from Visitation School wearing white gloves teared up as they lined the aisle. The school declared a day off in his honor. Who was this man loved by so many? He was a security guard. He was a realtor who had once fallen deeply into debt. He wasn’t a rich man or a famous personality. He was Bill Kenney and above all as his son Fr. Kevin Kenney explained in his homily at the cathedral he had three words that he wanted said at his funeral: “Jesus Jesus Jesus.”* * *In the early 1970s Bill Kenney was a hardworking husband and father in the throes of growing a small business. Kenney Realty had three offices in the Twin Cities and 40 licensed realtors. Bill put in long hours showing homes but he still found time to take his seven kids water-skiing. He bought a beautiful large home for his family near Lake Harriet in South Minneapolis. He loved to talk and meet new people he loved a good joke and he loved his wife Dorothy often bringing flowers home for her along with the groceries. He had learned his work ethic early. His father died when Bill was 16 and Bill had taken on two jobs to help support a family of 11 mostly younger siblings. His son Kevin recalls “From the minute we could walk we had to have a job of some sort oftentimes just in his real estate office. I remember as a little kid emptying wastebaskets and vacuuming and cleaning.”  Students at Visitation School lined up as an honor guard for his funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul. In the fall of 1973 Dorothy’s life changed when she decided to attend a weekend introduction to the charismatic renewal put on by their parish. At the retreat Anna Brombach a fellow mother Dorothy knew from church came over to pray with her. Dorothy remembers “I looked down and it wasn’t Anna’s hand taking mine. It was Jesus’ hand. I got home the next day and I was so on fire.” A full turkey dinner was Bill’s favorite thing to cook and he had one waiting for Dorothy when she came home from the retreat. As the kids started washing the dishes after the meal Bill and Dorothy went for a walk around Lake Harriet. Dorothy recalls “I’m jumping and dancing and I said ‘Would you ever go to a prayer meeting with me?’ He said ‘Oh Dorothy. You’ve always been joyful. What’s such a big deal about this? You go to the prayer meeting. I sure as heck don’t want to go.’” For two and a half years Dorothy went to the prayer meetings alone. Then in 1976 Jim Cahill caught Bill and Dorothy as they were leaving mass and mentioned that Bishop Lucker a friend of Bill’s would be at the prayer meeting that night. As Dorothy remembers Jim said “Bill why don’t you come?” and Bill said “Maybe I will.” “I nearly fainted away” Dorothy recalls. At the end of the prayer meeting that night Bill greeted Bishop Lucker. Says Dorothy “The bishop said ‘Bill Kenney! What are you doing here?’ Bill said ‘I don’t come to these things. My wife does’ and Bishop Lucker said ‘You come back five times and then decide if you’re ever going to come again.’ Well Bill obeyed him and he never stopped coming.”* * *Bill quickly became involved in the charismatic renewal attending conferences and praying with people. He and Dorothy joined the growing covenant community in the Twin Cities that would eventually become Servant Branch. Bill insisted that his teenage children attend charismatic conferences and all seven of them were eventually prayed with for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Bill started asking for the Lord’s help in the details of his life. Kevin recalls him praying over broken washing machines as well as his response to car troubles on a road trip. “I think the block cracked in the car. He says ‘We have to pray over it and it’ll get fixed.’ That was his faith.” Many of Bill’s friends recall him counting how many times priests mentioned the name “Jesus” in their Sunday homilies so that he could encourage them later to get their numbers up.  The Cathedral of St. Paul Bill’s parish and the site of his funeral. This shift in Bill’s focus impacted his business life too. By the late 1970s with the economy struggling it became clear that Kenney Realty was overextended. The company and therefore Bill as its owner had fallen hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt. Many years later Bill told the story to the Twin Cities Catholic charismatic renewal: “Because of my finances I decided I needed help. I received the Holy Spirit in my life and got serious about getting out of debt. I always made decisions to do things and then I asked God to bless it but now I was asking God’s opinion as to what I was doing.” Bill started referring to Kenney Realty as a Christian business and instituted an optional daily morning prayer at the office. In 1979 Bill brought in some community members with business experience to form a board of directors for Kenney Realty. Robert Regan who worked in investment counseling and served on the board recalls Bill asking for help with the administrative side of the business. “He was always gregarious a great salesman not as good as an administrator and manager or financial guy.” Good advice from brothers and a demand for houses that came from groups of brothers and sisters moving to the Twin Cities to join the community (from North Dakota Iowa and Washington) kept the business growing for a few years until another economic downturn in the early 1980s. Also in 1979 Bill and Dorothy began a process of downsizing that would continue into the 1990s. Dorothy remembers “To get out of debt he never filed for bankruptcy but he said ‘We have to sell the big house.’ “Dorothy loved their block because they were surrounded by at least eight other large community families and the Kenneys used their house to host morning prayer for the neighborhood but they left it behind for a smaller place on Minnehaha Parkway. Bill’s eye for real estate showed in the deal: the new house was more affordable but still in a lovely spot. Three years later Bill told Dorothy that they would need to sell the smaller house and rent something. To Bill’s surprise the first thing Dorothy asked about was curtains. “I said ‘If you rent a house you don’t want to put fancy curtains in there.’ Of all the crazy things for me to say but that’s what was on my heart at the time.” Soon after that Bill and Dorothy went to look at a condo at the Commodore an old converted hotel in St. Paul. The owner reported “We furnished the whole place and I just spent $10000 on window treatments.” They moved in and eventually bought the condo. Bill set up a small office downstairs where he kept Kenney Realty running as a smaller and smaller business until it finally disbanded in the 1990s when Bill went to work as a realtor for another firm.  Dorothy Kenney stands in front of a photo of herself and Bill on their wedding day two days after he returned from Korea. They were married 62 years. Finally in 1999 a confluence of events ended Bill’s remaining debt for good. Both a community member and a minister Bill had borrowed from separately decided to forgive him those large debts. A year or two earlier Bill and Dorothy had thought about selling the condo to move into a smaller apartment across the street from the Cathedral of St. Paul but it hadn’t sold. Then another apartment opened up in the same building so they put the condo on the market again and it sold for $20000 more than the original listing. Dorothy says “Bill always said ‘God dumped $20000 in my lap.’ So totally totally totally out of debt we started over.” Robert remembers “Bill had been living an upper-middle-class life and he made the transition to less money. He had to change dramatically. He made the transition just no problem at all. He trusted the Lord and never had a depressed day as far as I recall. The Lord let him down very gently step by step and gradually out of debt.” In the midst of all this Bill was busy for the Lord too. He was in Christians in Commerce. He was on the board of DeLaSalle High School his alma mater. He was chairman of the Catholic charismatic renewal in the Twin Cities. He and Dorothy joined the cathedral parish in St. Paul and Bill volunteered to run the men’s club pancake breakfasts. He was also constantly engaged in his favorite pastime talking to people about Jesus. Mark Lauer Bill’s head remembers going out to lunch with Bill. “He would get to know the waiter or waitress by name and a little bit about the person’s story. If any need came up he would say ‘I’ll pray for you.’” Bill and Robert played golf together regularly and sometimes they would pair off with a couple of golfers they didn’t know. Robert says “No matter who we were playing golf with Bill would somehow bring the Lord into the conversation: ‘Do you know the Lord? Are you going to church?’ A lot of people would say ‘I quit going 25 years ago.’ He’d tell them ‘You gotta get back in touch.’”* * *Around the year 2000 Bill took a newly created job as a security guard at Visitation School a Catholic school of about 600 students in Mendota Heights. Visitation starts with pre-K and the older students in grades six to twelve are all girls. Bill arrived in the afternoons and stayed to close the building at night watching the security cameras greeting visitors and walking the last few girls to their cars after dark. He discovered that the parking lot was a little chaotic in the afternoon with students crossing the street at the same time that vehicles needed to leave so he started coming in earlier to direct traffic sometimes in a funny winter hat.  A blanket from Visitation sits on Bill’s favorite recliner. Rene Gavic the head of school at Visitation remembers “He was the go-to person. He knew everything. He had keys for everything. He was a good problem-solver so if someone’s car wouldn’t start they would go to Bill first. He cared about you and would help you and support you in any way.” Bill noticed when the students were having difficulties. Mary McClure who teaches religion at Visitation recalls “He would ask ‘Would you like me to pray with you?’ He waited until he knew there was an opening. Sometimes girls would share a healing: they needed to run and they’d had an injury so Bill prayed and they were able to participate the next day.” Rene adds a story about her own daughter at Visitation. “When she was 12 she fell in a cross-country race and other runners stepped on her face with their spiked shoes. She needed 22 stitches in her face. As a 12-year-old girl that was challenging for her. I remember her coming to school the very first day back and what she wanted to do was have Mr. Kenney pray with her. He prayed with her and her situation and her self-image–all of that–never bothered her again.” At Visitation Bill developed a strategy for generosity. Once a month the students give one dollar to charity for permission to be out of uniform for the day. Bill dropped by the campus minister’s office on the day she collected the dollars and exchanged larger bills for her pile of ones. “In one of his pockets he had a little vial of oil to pray with people and in the other pocket he had maybe twenty single ones. That would be for the kids whose dollar got stuck in the vending machines” Mary remembers. Those ones also often made their way into the hands of the homeless.  Bill as St. Nicholas at his church in 2015. There’s no way to know for sure if the man who kissed his casket at the funeral knew Bill but we can be quite sure that Bill would have cared about him if he had ever met him on the street. In his later years Bill’s friends remember him always going up to homeless people standing on corners telling them that Jesus loved them and giving them one or two dollars for a cup of coffee. That human contact was important to him. Bill’s son Kevin adds that he would also offer a dollar or two when someone at the grocery store didn’t have enough to pay. “I think it was because people had helped him when he was in a time of need. It became a way of life for him” Kevin recalls.* * *On December 4 2016 Bill stayed after church at the cathedral to play St. Nicholas for the children while Dorothy went home. As he was leaving he fell on the sidewalk outside and a passerby called 911. He’d had a stroke and died within a few days. For Christmas Dorothy and the Kenney family gathered at the home of one of her daughters. Bill had dressed as Santa Claus for many years and Santa Claus wasn’t there that year. Dorothy’s kids coaxed her to the front door of the house. Dorothy recalls “Out the front door they had all these jars with candles in them spelling out ‘Jesus’ on the front lawn. It was so beautiful because Bill preached Jesus. I mean he preached Jesus preached preached Jesus.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6126
8182,Sept. 18 2020 4:07 p.m.,Mobile Dodges Bullet from Hurricane Sally,"Neighbor's tree lands on Mary Ellen Naylor's house. by Catherine Bulger Hurricane Sally blew through Mobile Alabama on Wednesday. Though most branch members lost power and many of their properties sustained minor damage—with fallen trees and shingles blown off brothers and sisters are praising God that everyone is safe. With a wind speed of 105 mph Sally made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane early Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores Alabama. Mobile is 40 miles northwest of Gulf Shores and sits at the north end of Mobile Bay which opens into the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately for Mobile the winds shifted slightly pushing water from Mobile Bay out towards the ocean instead of flooding the city.  The hurricane traveling at just two miles per hour stalled over the region for many hours. In Mobile lights began to flick out on Tuesday night and by Wednesday morning Alabama Power reported over 175000 customers without power in the area. Mobile ultimately received about five inches of rain and wind gusts of up to 82 mph according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile Orange Beach AL southeast of Mobile was deluged with nearly 30 inches as was Pensacola FL. “Mobile really dodged a bullet” said branch member Lydia Gaudet.   On Thursday after the storm had moved out and blue skies returned schools and many businesses remained closed. Majestic live oak trees lay uprooted in a historic town square. Myriad crews raced to restore power as quickly as possible and clear the streets of debris. The city imposed an overnight curfew to facilitate cleanup work.   Fallen leaves litter Steve and Lydia Gaudet's street.  Walter and Julia Drey's broken balcony railing. Walter and Julia Drey live on Dog River close to the bay. Their home is raised seven feet off the ground but it has flooded in past storms. Julia reported “The wonderful thing is that the river did not rise. The North wind actually blew the water out of the river so that was a real blessing.” The Dreys did have driving rain seep into the living room through cracks in the doors. They hurried around with towels mopping up water. “We set the alarm at night for every two hours to go around and check the house” she said. A lot of shingles blew off the roof so Walter put a tarp over it to prevent leaking. In the middle of the night the balcony railing finally gave way to the tree that had been beating on it continuously. “We’ve got a lot of yard cleaning up to do” said Julia “but my basic attitude is I’m very grateful it wasn’t worse.”  Mary Ellen Naylor lives with her sister and her adult son daughter and son-in-law. They lost electricity at 10:30 pm on Tuesday. At 3:30 am they heard the crack of the neighbors’ large oak tree followed by the crash as its branches landed on their roof breaking through in four places. Mary Ellen’s son-in-law went out later and cleared away as much tree as he could without the use of his electric chainsaw. He managed to get a tarp over most of the holes for now. “The rain was torrential at times a lot of it happening after dark. Trees were really whipping around” said Mary Ellen.  Branches poking through Mary Ellen's roof into the attic. “The worst part of a hurricane is the heat afterward” said Rose Denton. Bill and Rose Denton also lost power Tuesday night. It was hard to sleep after that especially for Rose and her mother (who lives with the Dentons). Rose was still off work but on Thursday Bill had gone out to the non profit camp he works at and spent the whole day doing cleanup on the property. The Dentons lost the awning over their kitchen door and part of their privacy fence. The cable line was down in the backyard.  Tony and Phyllis Compretta were getting ready on Thursday to put some of their food in Manny and Donna Ganzarain’s freezer since the Ganzarains have a generator. “Our street did look messy” said Phyllis “but people started coming out yesterday and cleaning up yards. There’s a lot of loose shingles. We can’t tell where they came from.” The Comprettas didn’t lose any large trees but Phyllis was mourning the loss of several smaller ornamentals including her crepe myrtle. “There was a lot more wind intensity than we realized it was going to be” she said. “It just went on for hours and hours and hours. I’m glad it wasn’t any worse.”  Steve and Lydia Gaudet also have a generator so they had something of an open door on Thursday with neighbors and grown children coming over to put milk and eggs in the refrigerator make coffee and charge cell phones. One of their children borrowed the camping stove and propane. “When you live here” said Lydia “you keep that stuff around.” “We’re so grateful that everyone is safe and that the damage wasn’t greater” said Mike Coney who is the coordinator from the branch relations council responsible for Mobile. “Please pray for the clean up effort in Mobile and especially for those in Alabama and Florida who sustained major flooding.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8182
8155,Sept. 15 2020 4:28 p.m.,Wildfires Burn in Oregon and Washington,"By Sean Connolly Jim McDowell (Corvallis) recalls the weekends and summers he spent at a cabin his family built amid towering hemlock trees on the north fork of Oregon's Santiam River. Starting from age 12 he helped clear the land and learned to spot Chinook salmon in the river. Over time he came to treasure the cabin as ""a place where you can step away from the world and see God face to face in the quiet.”  The cabin is gone now—burned in the Beachie Creek Fire. Beachie Creek is one of several conflagrations that swept down from the Cascade Mountains towards the heavily populated Willamette Valley home to the community's Corvallis and Vancouver/Portland branches. Energized by high winds it destroyed several small towns and scorched 190000 acres. Closer to Portland the Riverside Fire has burned 134000 acres while the Holiday Farm Fire southeast of Corvallis has burned 166000 acres.   Jim McDowell's family cabin burned in the Beachie Creek Fire.

As of Monday in Oregon 10 people have died from the fires and 22 are reported missing according to the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. The winds have died down for now allowing firefighters a chance to contain the fires. Dry conditions persist but there is rain in the forecast this week. Corvallis itself after experiencing fiery-orange skies and ash falling like a light snow for several days last week is now shrouded in a dense grey fog. The closest fire is 45 or 50 miles away by road and the city is not in immediate danger. All branch members and their houses are safe and yet life is hardly normal. ""We haven't seen the sun in over a week"" Principal Branch Coordinator Phil Monaco noted on Monday morning. ""There are hardly any sounds. Everything is stopped.”  The skies over Corvallis Oregon last week. Photo by Phil Monaco. With their air quality registering in the ""hazardous"" to ""very unhealthy"" ranges according to a U.S. government website branch members are largely staying indoors with their windows closed. The city hasn't picked up the trash in more than a week. Parks are closed. Tom Melton runs a road paving business but can't pave any roads since the asphalt plants are shut down. Tim and Mary Jo Wagner welcomed their son and his young family from Salem Oregon into their home since the Wagners have a good air-filtration system. Geoff and Nancy Myers bought pet food and cleaning supplies and took them to a dropoff point for delivery to evacuees staying at the fairgrounds. Jean Monaco has four cousins who live outside Vida Oregon near the heart of the Holiday Farm Fire. Two lost their homes and she is waiting to hear about the home of a third cousin. Bryan Thompson and his family have been going for decades to a private campground called Taylor Park in Lyons Oregon. They rent a space and have access to it year-round. Bryan says they were there on Labor Day weekend and knew the Beachie Creek Fire was nearby but the winds normally blow to the east so they were not concerned. After they left the winds blew west. “We have heard that all the structures are completely burned” he said. Eighty miles north of Corvallis Portland currently has the worst air quality of any major city in the world according to a report in The New York Times. The closest large fire the Riverside Fire is about 30 miles southeast of downtown Portland. It’s not currently threatening Portland but that could change with a strong westerly wind.  A view of downtown Portland on Saturday September 12. Photo by Lena Glover. ""As soon as you get outside it smells like a campfire” says Principal Branch Coordinator Charlie Fraga. ""Kids can’t go outside and play. It’s tough.”  He adds “Just like with the pandemic people in Portland are adapting to the new situation. You have a smile on your face and you’re praising God all the while.”  As in Corvallis branch members keep their windows shut to keep out the bad air and ash. Kathy Bucheit spoke about sealing cracks with towels and blankets to keep out the ash and the acrid smell. Her nephew is a firefighter battling the fires in Clackamas County just east of Portland where the Riverside Fire is raging. Another nephew in Clackamas had to evacuate. She said she hasn’t gone outside for more than three days except briefly to check the mail. Sunday’s Vancouver-Portland branch meeting was supposed to be held outdoors in small groups but instead took place on Zoom. The meeting included a time of praise and a sharing from branch member Toby Clairmont an emergency preparedness expert on how to create a “go kit” in case branch members need to flee as well as conversation about reaching out to neighbors and intercessory prayer.  A view of the Kenton neighborhood in North Portland. Photo by Charlie Fraga. Similarly at the branch meeting in Corvallis “We spent a good part of our time praying for the fire victims and that the Lord just put the fires out and that we get rain. We really need rain” Phil said. They added prayers for an end to the pandemic for peace amid the social unrest in Portland and for a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit. At their house in Battle Ground Washington Toby Clairmont and his wife Susie have their truck and RV ready to go in case they need to evacuate. They are about 20 miles from the Big Hollow Fire which has burned 20000 acres. Toby leads a volunteer team of amateur radio operators who are ready to help communicate evacuation orders to those living in hard-to-reach rural areas.   Ten or so miles away Jeff Lindberg says he has been able to see the sun through the smoke. “It looks like a full moon.” He adds “It’s been a drag for the kids lately because they want to go outside and play. For the most part we say 'No you can’t' but we let them play a bit yesterday [Monday]. For his part after losing his family’s cabin Jim McDowell says “I can see good coming out of it in the sense that for my family my brothers and sisters there’s an opportunity to bring us all together."" Charlie adds “With danger all around us we’re so grateful to God for protecting us. We ask everyone for prayers for rain for the safety of ourselves and our neighbors for those who have already suffered tragic personal loss for all of the firefighters and for a swift end to the wildfires.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8155

8132,Aug. 27 2020 4:40 p.m.,God Provides a Stove,photo by Collin Anderson (2008). by Paula Lent The woman strained to see her way through pitch black smoke as she crawled on the floor to escape the fire in her kitchen. A grease fire on her stovetop had burned out of control climbing up the wall behind the stove and filling her family’s Evansville home with smoke.   The woman a neighbor of the Evansville missionaries told Ellen Earhart about the fire saying that her household—her husband their three young children and her mother-in-law—were all safe but their stove was completely destroyed in the fire.   Ellen relayed the story to her husband John. That same day John received a call from Chris Vieck saying that another neighbor Mary Carter had called her to ask if Chris knew of anyone who needed a stove. Mary’s brother was getting rid of his and wanted to give it to someone in need.    “This is incredible that you’re calling right now” Chris had told Mary “because our neighbors just had a kitchen fire and need a stove.”   John was working at the Praise Harvest farm stand the following day when he noticed the husband of the family who’d had the fire carrying a load of laundry to his car. John told him about the stove Mary’s brother was giving away. The man was happy to hear of the offer and gladly accepted it but said that he wouldn’t be ready for the stove until repairs were finished in his kitchen.  The next day Chris and several missionary brothers went to pick up the stove. It was in great shape.  Chris noted “Mary’s brother likely could have sold it for a good price at a used appliance store. Somehow he and Mary thought that it could be used otherwise.” The missionaries stored the stove in a garage they own in the neighborhood.   A few weeks later the couple knocked on the Earharts’ door to let them know they were ready for the stove. As John helped them carry it through the alley to their house the man said he couldn’t take any more microwave meals. “He was about as excited as I’ve ever seen him” John recalls. After installing the stove John texted Chris to let her know how grateful the family was.   “I was amazed at the Lord’s thoughtfulness” says Chris. “It’s striking how he provides how he cares about the details of life and this family of six and what they were going through.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8132
8095,Aug. 21 2020 3:04 p.m.,Masked Mouths and Shining Eyes: Servant Camp 2020,"Glorious skies above camp.  ""Arise shine for your light has come and the Glory of the Lord is rising on you.” (Isaiah 60:1 Servant Camp 2020 Scripture verse).  by Catherine Bulger It’s the first week of August. Hundreds of campers aged 7 to 18 eagerly reunite with friends they haven’t seen in months. Units march across dewy fields to the rhythm of time honored tunes. Campfires blaze in the evening illuminating conversations about Scripture and following Jesus. Counselors who attended camp as children return for their 12th or 15th or 20th year. Archery and bike trips and field games and crafts are in full swing. Servant Camp is here again.  Except it’s 2020 and the coronavirus pandemic still rages. So Servant Camp this year like so much else looks a little no a lot different.    Parking lot opening ceremony in Servant Branch. Photo by Andy Bowar. It’s at three locations instead of one: River Ridge campus in Eagan Minnesota the South Bend branch center and the branch center in Rockford. It’s a day camp rather than the usual five-day overnight affair. Attendance is smaller than usual though still substantial. Campers and staff alike wear masks and mostly stick to interacting with their own unit. Everything is carefully planned--from how to drop kids off to how to clean field equipment between groups. In Minnesota opening and closing ceremonies happen in a parking lot with sound fed via radio transmission to the cars.  222 campers and 77 staff in total attended Servant Camp 2020. Camper attendance in recent years has been about 325. The camp directors did what they could to help the separate locations feel unified including distributing craft materials and t-shirts creating a joint Instagram account and live streaming Minnesota’s opening and closing ceremonies. The camp created a packet of activities people unable to attend could do at home which they posted on their website.  Servant Camp has seen its share of challenges and changes since its inception in 1978. In 1997 longtime staff member George Simmons died at camp. There was a frightening canoe accident. Gail Lee director and wife of former overall director Carmen Lee (Servant Branch) died in 2009. Camp has changed location several times. In 2012 South Bend camp merged with Servant Branch’s Servant Camp to form one joint camp. There have been injuries and illness and heavy storms and tornado threats. So far camp has gone on.   Andy Grams who has designed every camp shirt since 2002 put together this poster of all the shirt designs up to 2017.  Servant Camp 2020 t-shirt. Photo by Colleen Couch. When it became clear that a normal Servant Camp would be impossible this year the directors who meet regularly all year started talking about possibilities. Overall camp director Pat Ficker (Servant Branch) said “We’d get together and pray and say Lord is there something we can do?” Gradually the idea of a day camp on our own properties in separate locations emerged.   Director Jeanne Oberg (Servant Branch) who has served as a counselor since 1981 and a director since 1988 (she says she’s missed one year) credited younger staff with encouraging camp to move forward despite the challenges. “I wanted to take a year off” she said. “My daughter Annie said ‘No Mom we can do this!’” Another young staffer Margaret Maruggi approached her with the idea of a shared Instagram account to keep the locations united.  Pat said that a focus became: how do we do a few things well? Each location settled on activities that they had staffing and capacity for.   Pool noodle tag.   6th grade girls bike trip in Minnesota. Photo by Andy Bowar.  ""Hand arts"" at River Ridge. Photo by Andy Bowar. In Servant Branch the units (different age groups of boys and girls) were split between morning afternoon and evening shifts. Younger groups (1st-7th grade) came in the morning and afternoon. Director Mike Oberg (Servant Branch) selected one unit each day for a flag raising ceremony. Jeanne would gather the staff before children arrived and teach them camp songs to sing that day. Pat said the girls in particular were always singing as they walked from place to place.  John Brickweg ran field games like soccer and big base and pool noodle tag (the better to social distance). Nadine Reinhardt (Servant Branch) per tradition led “hand arts” or arts and crafts. There was a traditional 6th grade bike trip through the city and a 7th grade visit to a climbing tower. In the evening 8th-12th graders came for games snacks and small group prayer and discussion around a campfire.   The South Bend 7th graders went to a ropes course. Photo by Stephen Busk.

South Bend held camp two mornings and evenings flanked by opening and closing ceremonies. Directors Beth Couch and Stephen Busk (South Bend) had the new responsibility of organizing all the local logistics themselves. Beth says “We realized it’s really nice to show up on the bus and everything’s planned. But everybody here really pulled in and helped out and was very flexible to where they could go serve.” South Bend’s camp included archery (taught by two local instructors one of whom is a Trinity parent and one who has trained Olympic archers) “camp crafts” (building fires and other camp skills) a bike trip a ropes course white water rafting and talks in the evening for older campers.   Gaga ball in Rockford.

The last morning they all went on a bike ride and went swimming in the afternoon. The high schoolers split their time between working with the younger campers and doing service projects. One group built a wheelchair ramp for a branch member’s neighbor. The older boys took a canoe trip and the older girls went hiking and kayaking at a local state park. Amy Newburn (Rockford) who helped lead the camp said that many branch members jumped in and helped however they could. She added that she thought the counselors in Rockford learned from observing both Servant Camp and Action camps over the years.   South Bend Ponies. Photo by Colleen Couch. The first and second graders known as the Ponies normally only come for a day camp. The Ponies were the largest group this year with about 15 in South Bend and 22 in Minnesota. Stephen Busk remarked that it was a blessing to have camp for the younger children in South Bend who wouldn’t normally travel to Minnesota for a day camp. “It makes me wonder if we should do this every year--have a local day camp for them” he said.    Older boys play ultimate frisbee in Minnesota.   Learning ""camp crafts"" in Servant Branch.  The weather was glorious. All three locations had highs in the 70s low humidity cool breezes and not a drop of rain which reportedly may be a Servant Camp first. The evening attendees in Minnesota were treated to show stopping sunsets.  Pat said the weather was a gift from the Lord because the whole plan for camp was weather dependent. Heavy rain or storms or brutal heat would have threatened to cancel the day. Jeanne commented “I wanted something extravagant like renting a food truck or something outrageous. I think the weather was our extravagant thing.” The highlight was being together. Many of the children particularly the younger ones hadn’t seen many of their friends for months. The joy of seeing one another seemed to make up for all the parts of camp that were curtailed. Pat remarked “I thought what the Lord wanted this year was for the kids to be together and run and jump and play. And that was his miracle this year. You should have seen the eyes of these kids!”  Camp director Pat Ficker leads closing ceremonies.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8095
8085,Aug. 18 2020 2:19 p.m.,"""I Just Want to Thank You for Praying With Me""",Dave Roth on his family farm. by Chris Meehan As Dave Roth (Indianapolis) emerged from his camper on a recent Wednesday morning still tying his boots he noticed one of his contractors lying on his back in the driveway. Dave was on his family's black walnut tree farm and sawmill near Crawfordsville IN working on building a house for his brother. All the other builders were busy out of sight behind the house.  Wondering if the man had had a heart attack Dave rushed over and asked him if he was all right. “I threw out my back” the man said. “It happens every 8-9 months. It locked up even though I wasn't doing anything strenuous. I was trying to make it back to my truck and go home but I can't make it any further.”   The man Dustin said he had crawled on his hands and knees from the backyard to the front all the while wailing in pain. He looked white as a sheet. Dave offered him some water and a Pop-Tart and he accepted the water. At that point Dustin's boss came over and checked on him. When the boss returned to work Dave said “Dustin you look like you're still in a lot of pain. Would you mind if I prayed with you?” Dustin immediately raised his arm up to Dave and said “That would be awesome!” Dave held Dustin's hand and prayed for healing for God's power to go through his muscles strengthen his back and lighten the load on his nerves. Dave asked Dustin if he could do anything else for him but Dustin wanted to lie there a little longer and then try to get up. Dave went into the barn for about 15 minutes and when he returned to check on Dustin the man was gone. Dave went back home to Indianapolis and didn't return to the farm until the following night. In the morning Dave’s brother Randy who hadn’t been there when Dustin threw out his back told Dave that Dustin had returned to work and wanted to thank Dave for his prayer. Later that day during a spontaneous problem-solving meeting Dustin made his way around six other men to shake Dave's hand. He said “I just want to thank you for praying for me the other day. It immediately felt a lot better. By the time I heard you come out of the camper all I was able to do was lie there on my back and look up at the clouds and pray. I didn't think I was going to make it off the job site that day but I was able to get into my truck and then make it home. Your prayers really really helped.” Dustin went on to say that the other times he threw out his back it took a week to recover.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8085
8012,July 15 2020 10:33 a.m.,A School Year Like No Other,The Greenlawn campus set up for the commencement celebration. Photo by Tess Cassady. By Catherine Bulger with reporting by Kathryn Elliott On a muggy Friday evening in early June Trinity School at Greenlawn faculty members welcomed carloads of graduating seniors and their families onto campus directing them to parking spots along the long lane that runs through the property. Rows of balloon-festooned signs bearing seniors’ names decked the lawn flanking a small tent with a speaker’s lectern. A ring of carefully spaced chairs held faculty and staff. With everyone in place Greenlawn’s first outdoor commencement ceremony commenced.  Two Graduate Award winners gave an opening prayer and a valedictory (the Graduate Award is Trinity School’s highest award). Then each cap-and-gowned senior walked from the cars to stand next to his or her sign. Head of School John Lee closed the condensed ceremony with a brief address. Each senior received gifts prepared by the faculty: a personalized coffee mug a bound booklet of the traditional faculty honorings. a copy of James Joyce’s The Dead and a makeshift diploma because the real ones weren’t available yet—the company that makes them had been closed due to the coronavirus.

In Virginia local officials changed the regulations the day before Trinity School at Meadow View’s commencement allowing for outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people. Capitalizing on this freedom the seniors sat outside six feet apart with their families remaining in their parked cars. There was no commencement speaker because the event came together so quickly but the school decided to present three Graduate Awards instead of the usual two and each recipient gave an address. The graduating seniors walked across the outdoor stage to receive their diplomas. As the seniors departed other students lined the road in their cars to honk them out into the world.

At Trinity School at River Ridge the seniors received their diplomas in drive-through fashion as they entered campus. Seniors families and faculty positioned their cars throughout the large parking lot and stayed inside them for the ceremony. A radio transmitter broadcast the proceedings to all the parked cars. Car horns blared joyfully. Graduates poked their heads out of sunroofs to talk to their classmates. Dr. David Odde a biochemist at the University of Minnesota gave a commencement address. When the new graduates departed the faculty lined their cars into a triumphal corridor for them to pass through. “A lot of the graduates sat on top of cars myself included” said River Ridge senior Abby Theis. “We were able to take off our hats and wave them around.” “We joked about our senior gift being a giant hand sanitizer bottle that said ‘In memory of the class of 2020.’”*** Distance learning at Trinity began in mid-March. When it became clear that the rest of the semester would be held off campus conversations began about how to manage the end of the school year with its numerous traditions and activities and above all graduation. The three heads of school and the deans consulted the seniors and their parents.“They gave us a couple of options. We can do graduation next year or do it in August and a lot of people didn’t like either of these ideas” said Greenlawn senior Julia Zusi. In the end all three schools settled on their variation of an outdoor commencement in June.  Faculty members welcome graduating seniors and family to Greenlawn's campus. Photo by Tess Cassady. Normally Trinity hosts a dinner the night before commencement for faculty seniors and parents. Each senior is individually honored by one of the teachers. River Ridge Head of School Beth Schmitz said “One of the things seniors and parents expressed was really wanting to hear their classmates honored.” So instead of a dinner together River Ridge moved the honorings to a Zoom gathering. Another popular tradition near the end of the term at Trinity is morning prayer sharings given by the seniors. River Ridge was able to move those online as well. At Greenlawn the seniors wrote their sharings and recorded themselves giving them and they were sent to the student body in an email. Meadow View created a webpage to host the spring fine arts events that normally populate May evenings at Trinity. The website featured recordings of ninth- and tenth-grade musical compositions dramatic monologues by the senior drama students photos of senior artwork and a virtual choir produced by the music teacher.  Meadow View faculty delivered gift boxes to the graduating seniors at their homes. Photo courtesy of TSMV. Because the second senior drama production was cancelled Greenlawn decided to broadcast two readers’ theaters as Zoom video recordings that premiered on YouTube with each actor reading his or her part from home. To replace the Greenlawn spring fine arts night the two art teachers compiled a slideshow of all the eighth-grade and senior artwork. At River Ridge three long-serving faculty members retired: Penny Arndt Debby Salmon and Mary Radtke. Among them they have over 70 years of teaching experience at Trinity School. Penny has been dean of girls since the school began in 1987. Beth says it was very hard not to be able to honor them in person but they were able to celebrate the teachers at a virtual end-of-year ceremony on the last day of class. Likewise Greenlawn had two retiring faculty members to honor: Marge Connolly a long-time Humane Letters Seminar teacher and Tom Finke who helped found the school and served as its head from 1981-83 then again from 2002-04 and is moving from teaching to administration. The faculty honored them at a lunch (with tables spaced out for social distancing) the week after school ended.***All the end-of-year celebrations and activities happened on top of the many weeks of pivoting the normal Trinity spring curriculum to an online scaled-back format. John said “The instinct among the faculty was to achieve everything we normally achieve which was great and admirable but also impossible.” Most classes met online via Zoom two or three times a week (instead of daily) for about half the usual amount of class time per day. Teachers and students all needed to learn the technology. Ramping up the pressure some students were sharing computers with siblings and with parents working from home. The school decided to make courses pass/fail and cut back on the normal workload. Julia described her typical day. “I started with personal morning prayer worked out for an hour and then started schoolwork or had class. I would pace while I was reading or jump on the trampoline for 10 minutes in between subjects. Having classes and having morning prayer planned out helped me have a real schedule which was a struggle for the first three weeks.” She added “Most of the senior girls were working six to eight hours a day most of it on the computer. I sometimes get minor migraines that are light-induced so the screen time was hard for me but there’s a nightlight feature that filters out a certain kind of light that bothers people’s eyes.”  A Meadow View student performs a frog dissection from home with classmates on Zoom. Photo courtesy of TSMV. The teachers had to adapt their teaching styles dramatically. Lynda Seasly who teaches girls’ math at Greenlawn learned how to use an iPad so she could do problems in real time on the screen for her students. Mary Radtke who taught Scripture (among other things) at River Ridge would put reflection questions in the Google Classroom group chat. At Meadow View Tim Dusenbury recorded himself reading several chapters of Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov out loud for his students to follow along. Marge Connolly learned how to record short videos and upload them to YouTube so that she could explain difficult terms and concepts without wasting precious minutes of class time. Maintaining motivation to get schoolwork done alone at home was another challenge. Ben Bagiackas a Greenlawn senior said “Because the classes were pass/fail it was much more the guys in my class holding one another to a higher standard. We told each other to put in the effort for the sake of the effort.” Meadow View Head of School Kay Yohe commented “I was very proud of the extent the students kept up with really rigorous material when it was pass/fail. The vast majority of them really hung in there.” “Some subjects got harder” said Joe Whelpley a sophomore at Meadow View. “The new concepts in precalculus were difficult like inequality in matrices. Setting it up was harder because we couldn’t do it on our calculators together. You can’t really troubleshoot a friend’s calculator inputs on Zoom.” On the other hand he added “Chemistry was pretty unchanged. Other classes like Latin and New Testament were unchanged. They’re either translation or reading.” But Joe added that the hardest part of distance learning was missing classmates. “The best part about school—that was taken away from us—was the camaraderie. Seeing them on Zoom was not enough. We would text and say ‘I miss you guys.’ We would try to call one another but it can be hard to coordinate.”  Avy Flory a junior from Meadow View won the competition at The Dailies to recreate a famous work of art. Avy recreated a self portrait by Frida Kahlo. Abby agreed. “We had a goose chase (scavenger hunt) where we had to take pictures and send them in and we were in teams and that really helped. But other than that I didn’t get to see my friends much outside of class and that was hard. Not being able to talk to our teachers or the students was just really difficult.” Trinity Schools President Jon Balsbaugh led the charge in formulating distance learning throughout the difficult months striving to improve the experience. Among other things he created The Dailies—a cross-campus forum to share art music poetry and competitions such as kite-flying and Rube Goldberg competitions. The Dailies’ purpose was purely fun and love of learning. In a letter to the students explaining The Dailies Jon wrote “I encourage you to take time during the day especially to appreciate and respond to beauty. Read the poems and take them to heart. Don’t just glance at the artworks interact with them. And go to a quiet place close your eyes and listen to the pieces of music. Beauty will not be rushed.” “It was a really nice chance to have something that’s not in my normal curriculum” said Maggie Kocon a ninth-grader at River Ridge. “I got a taste of what younger and older students are thinking across all the Trinity Schools.”***There’s no denying distance learning was hard on students and faculty and parents alike. “Everybody’s tired and beat up” said John Lee. “I think people were more mentally and psychologically tired—more mental energy gets used up to keep focus in a way that’s not necessary when you’re rubbing up against people day to day.” Beth Schmitz added “One thing distance learning did was cast a spotlight on things we take for granted every day like 30-second conversations and just being together.”  River Ridge graduating seniors celebrate atop their cars. Photo by Bob Cunningham. Julia reflected “You go through all the grades thinking about what your last day will look like. Our class never had a field day [as seniors] because fall field day was also cancelled. It was really disappointing. But we still had really good Humane Letters conversations. We still had a final math project and figured out how to make small groups work together. I think [the school] did a good job of making sure we were able to still do all the big things.” Abby added “I’m not sure I would want to do it again but there was a lot of beauty in it.” “I saw the Lord in my students suffering” Marge Connolly said. “And it was a real suffering for them especially the seniors—what they had to give up and lay aside which was really important to them.” All of that may explain why there was such a release of joy as students faculty and parents gathered together in parking lots and on the lawn to celebrate the seniors and their completion of a Trinity School education to celebrate the completion of several months of a Trinity School education as it has never been done before.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8012
8064,July 10 2020 3:34 p.m.,God Moves in a Mysterious Way,"Today we want to share this timely new song performed by our missionaries “God Moves in a Mysterious Way.” The text thought to be the origin of the phrase “God moves (or works) in mysterious ways” was written in 1773 by the poet William Cowper. Cowper was a friend and collaborator of John Newton (the author of ""Amazing Grace"") and was active along with Newton in the abolitionist movement. Nick Holovaty based this arrangement on a hymn tune from Southern Harmony and Musical Companion William Walker ed. (1854). Cowper’s poem was originally entitled “Light Shining Out of Darkness.”   God moves in a mysterious way    His wonders to perform;He plants his footsteps in the sea    And rides upon the storm. Deep in unfathomable mines    Of never failing skill;He treasures up his bright designs    And works His sovereign will. Ye fearful saints fresh courage take    The clouds ye so much dreadAre big with mercy and shall break    In blessings on your head. Judge not the Lord by feeble sense    But trust him for his grace;Behind a frowning providence    He hides a smiling face. His purposes will ripen fast    Unfolding ev'ry hour;The bud may have a bitter taste    But sweet will be the flow'r. Blind unbelief is sure to err    And scan his work in vain;God is his own interpreter    And he will make it plain.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8064
8008,July 8 2020 9:44 a.m.,The Faith of a Child,"Praise Academy students. Photo by Mary Grams. by Mary Grams Editor’s Note: Mary Grams is a teacher at Praise Academy in Shreveport’s Allendale neighborhood. Several weeks ago I got a call from Joan Pingel the principal of Praise Academy. She told me about a healing story involving one of the school families. It had to do with a student I’ve taught in the past. I decided to give the mom Connie a call and hear more of the details. Connie told me she had been with her kids for the afternoon and was also taking care of several of her nieces and nephews all of whom have attended our summer camps in Allendale. Suddenly her eleven-year-old niece began having a seizure and became unresponsive. Connie said this girl was never known to have had a seizure before. The other children in the house began screaming and crying and Connie sent them out of the room to calm them down while she called 911. But due to some confusion about the address it took the first responders 25 minutes to arrive. Meanwhile Connie’s niece continued seizing--shaking and not responding to Connie.   In the midst of the chaos Connie’s son Dewayne a six-year-old Praise Academy student re-entered the room. He walked towards his cousin stretched out his hand and silently began to pray with her. In less than a minute the seizure stopped. Dewayne calmly turned and walked back out of the room. Connie called out to her niece and the girl responded “What?” She was fully alert and had no idea anything had happened. She told Connie “I just felt someone touch me and I woke up.”   Moments later the first responders arrived. They checked the girl’s vitals and everything appeared normal. They said she had no signs of having had a seizure but when Connie showed them a video of the event they agreed that she had had one. They brought the girl to the hospital where she had various tests done which also showed no abnormalities. Since then Connie says she has had no problems or recurrence.  Connie later asked Dewayne what he had prayed over his cousin and he said something along the lines of “I asked Jesus to come and be with her to help her and wake her up. And I prayed the coronavirus would end.” I wasn’t surprised that Dewayne would act with such faith. He prayed the way we often pray with one another at Praise Academy and I’ve actually had Dewayne pray with me. There have been a few occasions where I was coming down with a headache or feeling sick and I asked him to pray with me and I felt totally healed. But there’s more to this story than just the healing. There was a teenage girl who had been in the room as well. She’s a family friend of Connie’s who has told Connie’s family that she doesn’t believe in God. But Connie said that when the girl saw the healing take place she was just stunned. That night she came to Connie crying and told her “Did you see that? No one was there! That could have only been God.” She added “Dewayne had faith to believe God could heal and through Dewayne God healed.” She went on saying things like that for several days afterwards.  Not only was there a healing but there was also a conversion of heart that happened all because of this little one’s prayers. Hearing the story I was reminded of the passage from Luke 10 when Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said ""I give you praise Father Lord of heaven and earth for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike. Yes Father such has been your gracious will.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8008
7990,July 6 2020 4:26 p.m.,A Massive Food Giveaway in Minneapolis and St. Paul,Mike Stapp helps carry food boxes from the staging area in the KMart parking lot. Photo by Dave Hrbacek. by Chris Meehan with reporting by Elizabeth Pease Servant Branch members distributed 40000 pounds of food along with masks toiletries and games on a Saturday in late June. The distribution took place in a section of Minneapolis where some stores had been burned and others had been heavily damaged by the riots that followed the death of George Floyd and on the West side of St. Paul where the branch has an outreach. Mike Stapp (Servant Branch) helped organize the effort. Several weeks ago after seeing reports of the riots in the Lake Street area of Minneapolis on the news he went to the area in person and found along with still-smoldering buildings a grassroots cleanup effort with hundreds of volunteers carrying brooms and dustpans and picking up trash. Moved and inspired he decided that he too could do something to help. He already had experience securing overstock items from large corporations and donating them to People of Praise outreach efforts. After some research Mike found out that Food Rescue US a nonprofit helping with coronavirus relief had refrigerated semi-trailers packed with fresh carrots potatoes onions apples pears grapefruit and more that needed to be emptied while the food was still fresh. Mike agreed to accept one semi-trailer with 40000 pounds of produce to give away on Lake Street.  Meanwhile Mike Wacker knew that Source Mn a nonprofit organization with an outreach in the Lake Street area had been distributing food in a K-mart parking lot there. Mike Stapp called Peter Wohler a Trinity River Ridge parent and the director of Source Mn and found out they were planning to distribute food from a second semi on June 27. They agreed to work together.  A volunteer helps a woman load groceries in the KMart parking lot. Photo by Dave Hrbacek. With minimal publicity Mike attracted around 20 volunteers: a mix of Action members Action parents and branch members. On June 27 they joined dozens of Source Mn volunteers among them several students and alumni of Trinity and their families in the parking lot of a closed K-Mart that had been damaged by rioters. Many of them worked non-stop from 6:30 in the morning until 3 p.m. in the sweltering 90-degree heat. “Food distribution at the K-Mart lot didn't start until 11 am” says Rebecca Brubaker “but it took us several hours just to organize the crowd flow and food portions.” “Simply emptying the truck of its contents was an achievement” says Sam Claassen. “We had to remove 1650 25-pound boxes of food stacked in eight-foot high shrink-wrapped towers. Several layers of boxes had to be removed from the top of each stack just to get them into the tents where they were opened up and repackaged to smaller more manageable sizes” says Sam. “Some people walked there and had to be able to carry the food home.” Mike had also connected with Bed Bath & Beyond who donated N95 masks while other companies donated hair conditioner soap and shower gel antibacterial hand wipes and paper towels to give away. He was also able to get a few pallets of board games from Hasbro. “I loved to see the delight on the kids' faces when we gave them games” says Meg McManmon.   Mike Wacker and Pat Murphy load up carts outside 490 Hall Ave. on St. Paul's west side. Photo by Dave Hrbacek.  Mike worried that they would have a hard time giving away so much food in one day and the food banks closed on Saturday wouldn't be available to take leftovers so Mike and Pat Murphy decided beforehand to distribute some of the food on the west side of St. Paul on the two street corners outside 490 Hall Ave. the former convent which serves as the home of several members of the branch.  Though they had done little publicity hundreds of people stopped and picked up boxes of food some returning for more boxes for friends and neighbors.  Pat Murphy estimates they distributed over 400 boxes in St. Paul. Afterwards volunteers took leftover boxes and distributed them  in their neighborhoods. Mike Stapp noted that they didn’t want to waste any food or leave any behind either at the K-Mart lot or at 490. “It was such a joy to be able to be so generous to so many people with such high quality food” says Meg. “That must be how our heavenly Father feels every day!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7990

After graduation she worked as a nurse and later taught at American University and George Mason University. After Bob died in 2004 just three months after Georgine had retired as assistant dean of nursing at George Mason she became a nurse for her parish assisting the poor and shut-ins. She also initiated and hosted a monthly luncheon for caregivers. She was the parish nurse for several years till her own health began to decline but even then Georgine sought ways to serve those in need. She initiated our branch’s outreach with the Lamb Center—a ministry to the homeless in our area. Pat Pawlosky remarked on how important it was to Georgine that the guests receive a nice hot breakfast which many times she prepared herself. More importantly she encouraged volunteers to interact with the guests while they ate. Pat said Georgine set a wonderful example mingling and listening to people’s stories. Eventually Georgine’s failing health forced her to step down as the outreach leader but the ministry continues to this day. Shortly before her death a number of sisters presented her with a special quilt with reflections and Scripture quotes for her. Due to so much love and generosity from her People of Praise family Georgine was able to receive that same love and the legendary generosity that she had so often given to others. A very special and dear sister she died on Mother’s Day. FACTS● Georgine Richardson was born in New York City May 1 1937 and raised on Long Island.

7950,July 2 2020 1:20 p.m.,Whit Au,by Mary Duddy Other scientists knew him as Dr. Whitlow Au Ph.D. the preeminent world expert in the echolocation of dolphins and whales and 2016 recipient of the Acoustical Society of America’s Gold Medal. We knew him simply as Whit humble and unassuming who along with Dorothy opened their home and picturesque back yard for branch potluck dinners and Fourth of July picnics. In 1971 Whit was baptized in the Holy Spirit and to the end of his days he promoted baptism in the Holy Spirit. He wrote: “I felt like I walked through a spiritual door into a different spiritual realm that I never knew existed.” Whit was a mentor—to students of science (“If you’re not having fun you’re doing it wrong”) and to branch youth like Chris Macalintal. While pulling weeds with Whit Chris received doses of life-skill wisdom such as “Remember we may lose some battles but we won’t lose the war.”  Whit led the Catholic charismatic renewal in Hawaii for over 25 years including 15 years of charismatic conferences healing services and workshops. For years he met with an ecumenical group of charismatic pastors. Whit always sought God’s will in decisions. In 1993 the Naval Ocean Systems Center where he worked was transferred to San Diego. Most of Whit’s co-workers moved but Whit felt the Lord wanted him to continue his People of Praise commitment so he and a partner created a new lab on Coconut Island the Marine Mammal Research Program.

7928,June 27 2020 2:03 p.m.,In Allendale God Delivers Food,"""Trip to Trader Joe's"" by jonathanteixeira is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 by Paula Lent In Shreveport’s Allendale neighborhood there’s a mysterious woman driving around with an old tan minivan. She’s got a surprising knack for answering prayers. One neighbor Miss Fannie told missionary Evan Lent that she was making a shrimp dish when she realized that she didn’t have any milk for the batter. She called the store but it was also out of milk so she went across the street to borrow some from a neighbor. No sooner was Miss Fannie out her front door when two vehicles pulled up: her daughter’s and an old tan van. The woman in the van asked the daughter if she needed any food and then gave her some. The daughter then turned to her mother and called out asking if she needed any milk. Stunned the mother told her she did need milk. Miss Fannie concluded “My God is so good.”  One day near the beginning of the pandemic when Evan was making his weekly trip for groceries the store had very few items on his list such as two loaves of bread. He came home with about one-third of the items he was looking for. On the way home Evan mentioned his discouragement to the Lord. When he arrived he found that the lady with the van had dropped off two loaves of bread while he was gone. Another time Evan got a call from Jaylen an 11-year-old former Praise Academy student. He and seven of his siblings from toddler to teenager live with their single mom who’s in her early 30s. “Do you have any leftovers?” Jaylen asked. Evan knew it wasn’t an idle question. The family used to rely on free and reduced-cost meals from school but because their mother doesn’t have a car and schools are closed because of the coronavirus they haven’t had much food lately. Evan told Jaylen he’d see what he could do and immediately took over some food. In the days that followed Jaylen’s call Christians in Mission team leader David Zimmel and Evan were continuing to discuss Jaylen’s situation. Then the neighbor with the tan van called David and asked if he needed some milk. He didn’t but he said he’d take it anyway and  give it to someone who needed it. Later she dropped off more than five bags of food including fruit snacks individual cartons of milk and microwavable meals--all items David says are  “really the perfect thing” for Jaylen and his siblings. When Evan went to deliver the food at Jaylen’s house he asked some of the kids to help him unload the groceries. They were excited about the food. One child picked up a piece of fruit smiled and ran off with it.  As Evan followed the kids back to the house Jaylen’s brother D’Adrian ran up to him meeting him part way to the door and asking if there were more bags he could help carry. Evan paused to talk to him telling him about the woman with the tan van who had dropped off the food and explaining how it seemed like God had wanted the family to have this food. D’Adrian asked Evan to thank the woman for the food and Evan suggested that D’Adrian could say thank you to God because it seemed clear that God was giving them the food. “Say thank you to God? How?” D’Adrian asked. Evan said “Just like that: ‘Thank you God.” “Thank you God” D’Adrian repeated with an inquisitive face looking to Evan to make sure he had got the phrase right. Then he said it again this time clearly talking to the Lord: “Thank you God.” During the next weeks D’Adrian had two more encounters with Evan with two more short lessons about God. He told Evan that he’d had a prayer time on his own as Evan had taught him and had also started helping some of his neighbors. They walked around the neighborhood and D’Adrian pointed out people he’d helped such as the older woman whose trash he’d taken out. He said that after helping people he’d thanked God. Thanking God is one thing but thanking the woman with the minivan is harder. David has seen or heard of at least a dozen families who have received surprise food drop offs and there are other good things happening besides the drop offs. He says he can’t be 100 percent sure that it’s the same woman in all the stories but he’s pretty sure who she is--a single mom a bit on the shy side who’s been getting the food from local churches and other donation places outside the neighborhood and giving it to people who can’t travel. She seems humble and intent on helping the next person in need. After her donation helped out Jaylen’s family in such a big way David did manage to thank her in person. “It was a beautiful story. I wanted to make sure she heard it.” She responded by asking him to let her know if he knew anyone who needed another donation. David did just that a few days later when another Praise Academy family was in need of food. Perhaps she likes it this way being the mysterious woman serving her neighbors with her van and her resourcefulness. Perhaps she sees that by her being hidden neighbors are turning their thanks to someone else. The neighbor who told Evan about receiving the milk for her shrimp began her story with “You know what God did for me?”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7928

7885,June 19 2020 3:33 p.m.,Family Reconnects After Decades Apart,"Jim Cahill (left) with Jim Carter. Photo courtesy of Jim Cahill. by Chris Meehan Two sisters spoke to their father for the first time in 27 years last week thanks to an assist from Jim Cahill (Servant Branch) and help from the Holy Spirit. The father’s name is Jim Carter. He’s part of an informal men’s group that meets at Cerenity Humboldt an assisted living facility a couple of blocks from the apartment house where Jim Cahill and John Ostby (Servant Branch) live on the West Side of St. Paul. In general “the men in Cerenity have very few family ties” John says “so the group is important to them.” Almost three decades ago Jim Carter lost custody of his two young daughters in a divorce proceeding. It wasn't what he wanted to happen. An ex-offender he had struggled with alcohol and drugs.  He asked Jim Cahill three months ago if he would help locate his now grown daughters Mary Jo and Gayle. They were raised by foster parents in Ohio. After the children were taken away from him he lost track of them. Jim Cahill tried to locate them but couldn’t. Then Thursday June 4 he ran into Jim Carter on the patio in front of Cerenity. “We talked for half an hour” says Jim Cahill “and as I was leaving he asked me once again if I had located his daughters. I told him I had tried but given up and asked him to forgive me. He did and chastened I started searching again later that day.” He went to the online white pages for the two towns the daughters were known to have lived in.  He found three listings which he had missed the first time he had searched. Only one of those listings included a name and phone number. There was no Mary Jo or Gayle listed but in desperation he called the number and it turned out to be Jean the girls’ foster mother. Surprised she asked how Jim had found her unlisted unpublished phone number. Jim told her it was right there in the white pages for her town. Jim recalls “She said ‘That can’t be’ and I started thinking God put it there. Jean gave me both girls’ phone numbers. She said Mary Jo had asked just the day before how she could get in touch with her dad. What timing!” Jean immediately told the girls and after several calls back and forth with Jim Cahill they decided to talk with their father via Zoom on Thursday using Jim Cahill's smartphone. Only two hours later however Mary Jo called Jim Cahill and wanted to know all she could about her daddy.  Gayle likewise called on Sunday and said she couldn’t wait until Thursday to talk to him. Jim Cahill says “I hurried over to Cerenity and found Jim on the front patio. I asked him ‘Do you want to visit with Gayle now--because she really wants to talk to you.’ He said ‘Sure.’ I called her back and they talked and gushed for half an hour."" The following Thursday Jim Cahill set up a joint Zoom call for Jim Carter with both daughters. Before the call the two prayed together for trust forgiveness restoration and love founded on Christ. Jim Cahill says “Now we have pictures of Jim Gayle Mary Jo and their children going back and forth on my phone. It’s just thrilling and humbling to watch. Never before have I seen God’s timing be lovingly born in the hearts of such broken relationships. I saw 27 years of doubt anger and fear be immediately removed and replaced by hope and the need to be together. The two girls want to come and visit and Jim now knows he has two grandsons from Gayle and he can hardly wait to know them better.” Jim Carter says “I’m overwhelmed. I loved every minute of getting back together with my daughters. I never expected to hear from them but I’m very glad I did. I was determined to never give up.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7885
7871,June 17 2020 10:08 a.m.,John Gauthier,by Bill Parker Branch member Frances Dahl invited John to a public meeting in 1999. After the meeting I could see he’d been touched by the Spirit but I had no idea of the Lord’s plan for this nearly broken lonely man and the place he would come to have in our hearts. He was living in a small apartment attached to his uncle’s storage unit warehouse. John managed the business so he couldn’t leave the site for more than a few minutes at a time. John a former Shreveport policeman felt incarcerated by his job. We had mutual interests and quickly became close friends.  After three or four men’s group meetings and branch meetings he came underway in 2000 and made the covenant March 10 2005.  John and Frances’s friendship grew into love. He told me that if Frances would agree to marry him he would go directly to church to kneel and thank the Lord. That’s exactly what they did after he proposed and Frances said yes. They were married July 20 2002. John retired from his warehouse job and became involved in People of Praise service especially hosting summer Action youth. John and Frances became Third Order Franciscans in 2012 and John had a small workshop in his backyard where he made rosaries—which he gave away with the request that the recipient pray for him. On the same workbench he reloaded rifle cartridges for his own use and for whoever would ask. John and Frances shared their love for hunting and fishing with interested youth in our branch. They will greatly miss him just as all of us will.  FACTS●  John Gauthier was born March 15 1939 and raised in Hessmer a small town in central Louisiana. He died December 21 2019 in Shreveport. He grew up speaking Parisian French (not Cajun as John would let you know).●  He loved the outdoors fishing and hunting and also loved reading especially American and European history.●  John attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana before joining the Air Force in 1960. He served for four years in Morocco and Europe then married and raised two sons. Sadly this marriage ended in annulment.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7871
7863,June 16 2020 3:06 p.m.,Anastasia Evans,"by Beth Bulger Anastasia loved (in no particular order) a hearty laugh being Irish her family telling stories Native American customs the history and determination of African Americans singing the Lord the church clothing and jewelry with a flair helping people face and overcome relationship difficulties choosing just the right memento for a specific person for a specific reason teasing children giving parents timely advice about child-raising and her sisters and brothers in the People of Praise. She was larger than life. She half-convinced my mother that she was a long-lost Russian princess (because of her first name) and made a fast friend in the process. She did convince my children that Easter was her personal day (partly because “Anastasia” means ""Resurrection"" in Greek).  Over the years various infirmities kept Anastasia from participating in many events outside her home but members of Servant Branch who got to know her found a treasure. Long after you had told her of a concern or worry you discovered she was still praying about it. And she was quick to call to ask for prayer when her own concerns loomed. Our unity in prayer may have been what was most important to her. A valiant single mother Anastasia raised five children. She faced many health difficulties yet she pressed on loving the Lord. In our life she had a special love and kind advice for elderly sisters who had known loss. As her death approached no longer able to speak much she welcomed visitors with a radiant smile.How fitting for one whose name means ""Resurrection.""FACTS● Anastasia was born October 22 1943 and died December 13 2019. She made the covenant of the People of Praise in Servant Branch October 15 2006.● She raised five children and her family now includes six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren (one born the same day as her funeral).● Anastasia received her B.A. from the University of Minnesota in African American Studies and her M.A. in social work from St. Mary’s University of Minnesota.

7851,June 13 2020 12:14 p.m.,God Provides in Allendale,Charlie Lindenmayer By Chris Meehan “Everything’s okay” the grandmother told Evan Lent summing things up for her household of 11 in Shreveport’s Allendale neighborhood. But after Evan pressed a bit more she explained that the two toilets in the house were stopped up and the kitchen sink drain was also plugged. Sewage erupted from the sink when someone tried to flush one of the toilets. The problem had started a few days before. The woman had farmed out four of the five children who lived there (including an infant) until the problem was resolved. “I'm disgusted!” she said.  According to her landlord the problem was her responsibility to solve. Adding to her burden was the fact that a recent storm had damaged the wiring in the house and some of the electrical outlets weren't working.  “I don’t have the money to pay for the repairs” she told Evan “Can you help us out?” Evan suggested they pray together and assured her he would look into the situation. “Things will get better” she told him. “They couldn't get any worse!”  Evan talked with David Zimmel and Nathan Barrett to see if the CIM alms fund could afford to hire a plumber. Just two days earlier  a member of the People of Praise had anonymously donated $1200 from an economic stimulus check to assist in just this type of situation. They had the money to help. David called a close friend of Bud Rose (South Bend) Charlie Lindenmayer  who is a local plumber. “Now retired Charlie heard about what we were doing in the neighborhood early on and became friends with Bud” says David. “Charlie has worked on every construction or remodeling job we’ve had in Allendale since then. His work is very professional and he always gives us the best deal possible usually even better than we asked for.”  Bud would often stay at Charlie’s home when he visited. Bud still tells the story of the time Charlie gave up a fishing trip at the last minute to fix a break in an Allendale neighbor’s sewer pipe.  At one point the job required Charlie to reach down into a puddle of sewage to repair the hole in the pipe. The muck went up to his shoulders but Charlie pressed on until the job was finished. “That’s when I started addressing him as ‘St. Charlie’” says Bud. Charlie met Evan at the house the same day David called him and spent more than four hours clearing all the drains. “Snaking the drains was a dirty messy job” says David.  Evan called Charlie to find out what they owed him. Charlie said there was no charge. David and Evan talked and ended up sending him  $300 from the donation they’d received. “We had to insist he take $300 which was significantly less than what we would have paid anyone else” says David. Charlie says he’s happy to help because “the People of Praise is doing a wonderful job working with young people in impoverished neighborhoods. It’s a great way to make a difference in a neighborhood when you can help young people get started on the right path.” The grandmother thanked Evan the next day and the children were able to come home. “I was encouraged by the way the Lord showed his love for her family” Evan says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7851

7818,June 10 2020 5:06 p.m.,Neighbors Helping Neighbors,MISSIONARY TIPS FOR HELPING NEIGHBORS IN A PANDEMIC Food Box Plan Over the past few weeks our missionaries in Evansville have been visiting neighbors once again after pausing for several weeks due to the pandemic. They go out in groups of two or three wearing masks and carrying hand sanitizer. They knock on doors and ask simply “how are you doing?” What they’ve found is that many people are willing to talk—more people than in the past. Many are lonely. Some have other needs: for food for jobs for something for the kids to do for medicines and other errands needs around the house the yard and so on. The missionaries have been doing what they can to help dropping off food pulling weeds talking with children running errands for neighbors and always praying. As other neighbors and friends find out about what the missionaries are doing they’ve been getting in on the action—giving the missionaries food and money to distribute. Our missionaries are becoming a conduit for love and service.  This kind of personal visiting going out to our neighbors and checking in is something many of us can do. In a certain sense all you have to do is walk out your front door and encounter your neighbor. The biggest obstacles may be on the inside where the devil sows fear and doubt but Jesus gives us the strength to overcome temptations. We wanted to share this information with you to encourage and inspire you to go out and meet Christ in your neighbors. Christ is suffering now in so many ways. As one spiritual writer put it “We do truly comfort Him most when recognizing Him in our neighbor we serve and love our neighbor for the love of Him.” As you give this a try in your own neighborhood please send us your own stories of how you are finding Christ in your neighbors. Let’s make this a summer of service!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7818
7804,June 8 2020 4:01 p.m.,In Servant Branch Looking Out for Neighbors,by Catherine Bulger Community members in Servant Branch are finding creative ways to help their neighbors during the coronavirus pandemic.  Loren and Mary Ann Smerud Tina LaVergne and Meg Ferber all live in a 55-and-older residential co-op in West St. Paul called RealLife Cooperative. Members buy in and collectively own the building while each living in their own unit. The co-op has a motto: “A neighborhood under one roof.”  But until recently they did not have much of a deliberate common life.  For several years Loren who is on the director’s board for the building along with Tina has been thinking and talking with other board members about creating more community. They decided to begin by dividing the six wings of the building—each floor has two wings with 13 to 18 units per wing—into neighborhoods. The neighborhoods would be a locus for social gatherings and more shared life among neighbors. Late last year the neighborhoods were officially formed. “We see to it that peoples' needs are met; they can get acquainted with one another and do things together” Loren says. Then the pandemic hit. Gatherings were cancelled common areas closed and residents were encouraged to stay inside their units. The function of the neighborhoods changed to focus on helping one another through the pandemic. Tina a public health nurse taped envelopes to all the doors for easy communication. She got some door tags which read on one side “I’m ok” and on the other “I have a need.” Each morning residents hang the tags on their doors. The neighborhood leaders then go around and check on everyone by reading their door tags. Most of the time people are fine. Sometimes someone forgets to hang their tag out so they get a phone call check-in from a neighborhood leader. Tina says “We recently had a person who didn’t put the door tag out so her neighborhood leader checked on her and it turns out she’d fallen.” Meg Ferber is a leader for her neighborhood and she called someone who didn’t put her tag out and discovered the woman was disoriented. Meg was able to track down the woman’s daughter to come pick her up.  Loren thinks the neighborhoods have been invaluable during the lockdown. “This is not how we envisioned the neighborhoods working” he says. “But I don’t know what we would have done without them to help keep people safe.”  Loren Tina and two other members formed an ad hoc committee dedicated to keeping residents safe. The committee bought a shed and put it by the front door so delivery services can leave packages without entering the building. The neighborhood leaders then bring the packages inside for residents to pick up.  Neighborhood leaders have tried Sunday afternoon get-togethers: where everyone stands on their deck and talks to adjacent neighbors. One day they ordered take-out from Subway for residents. One of Tina’s daughters is a fire dancer and she put on a show for the residents walking around outside doing her fire and hula hoops routine for an hour while people watched from their balconies. Meg says “The other night I was calling people with a message from the police (during the recent riots). One woman in her 90s lives right across from me and said ‘I need some help.’ She couldn’t get one of her medicine bottles open. She put it in a bag by her door and I opened it up and put it back for her. So it is helpful for people to have some kind of contact.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7804
7791,June 5 2020 3:44 p.m.,Pentecost Praise and Worship,We’d like to share a few more Pentecost songs from some of our celebrations this past weekend.  In South Bend the branch’s music ministry prepared a virtual band and choir rendition of a few songs as part of a live streamed community meeting. The first song was “The Blessing” which has been sung by virtual choirs of Christians around the globe since the coronavirus pandemic began. By singing along you can join your voices with those of many brothers and sisters in Christ pronouncing a blessing on all people. (If you’d like to see the ecumenical and heartfelt UK Blessing again you can view it here.)    The second song was “Revive This Land” by Jared Gonzalez (Colorado Springs). The South Bend music ministry participants included Collin Anderson (choir) Anna Balsbaugh (choir for The Blessing) Thomas Brophy (choir for The Blessing) Annie Bulger (choir) Catherine Bulger (choir) Tom Finke (bongos) Elizabeth Grams (lead vocals) Larry Grauvogel (guitar) Emilie Grondin (bass and cello) Jim Grondin (soprano saxophone drums for Revive This Land) Joe Heintzelman (mandolin) Mark Hoover (choir) Frank Massa (drums for The Blessing) Tom Noe (tamborine forThe Blessing) Suzanne Thomas (choir) Ginny Timler (keyboard) and Mike Zusi (guitar and choir for The Blessing). Jim Grondin arranged the music for the group. Elizabeth Grams and Tom Zusi edited the audio.     In the Twin Cities the People of Praise was invited to participate in a Pentecost service sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. During the service a small crowd viewed a video of Jim Rolland and Chuck Fossen singing and playing “Send Your Rain” by Kelly Carpenter. The service was broadcast on Facebook and can be viewed here; to get to the video of Jim and Chuck scroll the playbar to 1:39:30 (about three quarters of the way through the service).  Lord pour out your Spirit upon our land!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7791

Photo courtesy of Malia Busekrus. by Chris Meehan At 3:30 a.m. on Sunday May 17 Malia Busekrus (northern Virginia) awoke and smelled what seemed like burning rubber. “I went downstairs to check on things” she says “and I saw the side of the house in flames! My husband Mike called 911 and I ran through the house calling out ‘Wake up! Fire!’” Six other people were living in the house: their son Tim (23) their daughter Samantha (20) their son Nicholas (18) their daughter Abigail (15) their 16-year-old exchange student Frank and Malia’s mother Mary Dohrman. It was only after everybody was safely outside that they heard the smoke alarm finally go off. “We think it was delayed because the fire started on the exterior of the house and the smoke detector was on the inside” Malia says. “It’s likely we would not have lived if I hadn’t woken up.” The family stayed outside watching for four hours as firemen battled the blaze. Neighbors brought them blankets water and footwear and made their homes available. “People let us in and for a moment we all forgot about the pandemic” says Malia. American Red Cross staff arrived around 5:00 a.m. and brought more blankets snacks and prepaid debit cards if they wanted to move to a hotel for a few days. Principal Branch Coordinator Bob Magill came at 8:00 a.m. and the Justens and Mysliwiecs brought bagels and coffee. Despite the firefighters’ best efforts the three-story structure was virtually destroyed. Only the foundation and a brick wall remain. The house will need to be rebuilt and the Busekruses plan to rent another home for a year. Meanwhile they are staying in the home of a Trinity School at Meadow View family who is living elsewhere. The cause of the fire is still unknown.  Photo by Mike Busekrus. Mike says “I was very deeply moved by the cooperation and teamwork of all the People of Praise who were there early in the morning and basically haven’t left our side since then continuing to connect with us to reassure us that we are not alone and reminding us that all things work out for the good for those who love God.” Tim who graduated from college the day before the fire says “We’re still in shock but one thing we do know is how loved we are by the People of Praise and many others. The Mysliwiec family opened up their home immediately and Jim Mysliwiec even bought me a new laptop knowing that I couldn’t start my internship (sports marketing at American University) without one. ” Samantha agrees. “Seeing bag after bag of clothing show up at our door receiving financial support opening notes and cards from people telling us that we were being prayed for and reading random texts from people demanding that they help me brought tears to my eyes. Many donations came from friends or from friends of friends who don’t even know us.” Bob Magill adds “Mike is an area coordinator as well as principal of St. Veronica Catholic School; Malia teaches fifth grade at St. Thomas More Cathedral School; they have children at Trinity School at Meadow View. All these folks plus the whole People of Praise branch came together to support them. The online meal signup that Stephanie Justen organized for them was filled in about four hours so we extended it another month because so many others wanted to bring meals. Members from other branches contacted me to see what they could do. Sometimes when so much else gets stripped away you can see that it really is love that remains. The Busekrus family has given so much to others here so everyone was blessed to give a little back to them.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7770
7754,May 29 2020 4:20 p.m.,Sing and Pray: Come Holy Spirit!,0:46 Come Holy Spirit by Patrick Power2:07 Come Holy Ghost4:46 Let That Same Spirit6:24 Give Me Oil in my Lamp7:35 Bless the Lord O My Soul While there have been many changes in our community life these past months one thing is still true: we can sing and pray from our homes uniting our voices in the Spirit. After all the Holy Spirit on Pentecost was certainly not prohibited by the walls of a home. As Jesus points out “The wind blows wherever it wants” (John 3:8 NLT). To that end we’d like to share one last video in anticipation of Pentecost.

7725,May 22 2020 4:30 p.m.,Crowns of Thorns,"""Head of Christ"" by Otto Lange 1916. By Sean Connolly This week I came across a story that captures both the suffering and the blessing which Jesus speaks of in the Beatitudes. Our Lord’s words are surely meant for this present moment in which so many are sick struggling to provide for their families or simply disappointed as future plans are dashed against the rocks. We know about the suffering. Where is the blessing? The story comes in a book called Caryll Houselander: That Divine Eccentric by Maisie Ward. Caryll was a British writer and artist who died in 1954. More than that she was a woman of deep prayer. (As a side note my copy of the book is on loan from my mother Marge Connolly who wrote about Houselander in New Heaven/New Earth in 1984. My mom got her copy from Nanci Panos now of the Northern Virginia branch. In the community everything is connected!) When Caryll Houselander was young she attended a convent school in England which was run by French nuns. One of the nuns Sr. Mary Benedicta came to the convent from the German region of Bavaria. Sr. Mary spoke “little English and… very bad French” which meant she could barely communicate with her fellow nuns.  As the biographer Ward recounts “[S]he wore an old habit so patched and darned that nothing of the cloth seemed left.” She was an educated woman who chose “the dirtiest jobs” even sticking her hand down a clogged drain to unplug it. Ward reports that Sister Mary chose a life of menial service in the convent as a form of penance for the life she had lived before. All this took place during World War I a time when being a German nun in an English convent run by French nuns must have made life extraordinarily difficult on a personal level for Sister Mary. The nuns had a map on the wall with flags marking the advance of the German army into France and they noted how the Germans were taking over many of the places where the French nuns came from. The nuns did their best to console Sr. Mary but she must have felt great shame as Ward notes. One day the child Caryll Houselander had an encounter with this Bavarian sister. In Caryll’s words: “I was passing the boot-room the little room where our shoes were kept; the door was open and the Bavarian nun was sitting alone cleaning shoes. I can see her now as if it were yesterday—a tall gaunt woman with brilliantly red cheeks and eyes so dark that they looked black. . . . I stopped and went in intending to help her to polish the shoes. It was only when I had come quite close to her that I saw that she was weeping; tears were running down her rosy cheeks and falling onto the blue apron and the child’s shoes. Abashed I dropped my eyes and stood in front of her speechless with embarrassment completely tongue tied. I saw her large toilworn hands come down onto her lap and fold on the little shoes and even those hands red and chapped with blunted nails were folded in a way that expressed inconsolable grief.”“We were both quite silent I staring down at her beautiful hands afraid to look up not knowing what to say; she weeping soundlessly.“At last with an effort I raised my head and then—I saw—the nun was crowned with the crown of thorns.“I shall not attempt to explain this. I am simply telling the thing as I saw it.“That bowed head was weighed under the crown of thorns.“I stood for—I suppose—a few seconds dumbfounded and then finding my tongue I said to her ‘I would not cry if I was wearing the crown of thorns like you are.’She looked at me as if she were startled and asked ‘What do you mean?’‘I don’t know’ I said and at the time I did not.I sat down beside her and together we polished the shoes.”Today Christ is suffering in so many people. In two boys from Trinity School at Meadow View I read about who contracted coronavirus and continue to fight for their lives. In all those who have died apart from their loved ones and in those loved ones who are separated from them. In the millions who have lost their jobs—their vital means of providing for families. In those who stand in lines for food. In the nursing home workers who soldier on in dangerous conditions patiently performing their acts of service. In all those whose names so quickly come to each of our minds. Do you see them crowned with their crowns of thorns?",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7725
7719,May 21 2020 2:25 p.m.,"""I Traced a Cross on His Forehead""",by Catherine Bulger Becca Maslow (Servant Branch) is a nurse at a Minneapolis hospital Hennepin County Medical Center. She normally floats between different units but during the COVID-19 outbreak she has been working primarily in the intensive care unit. One day in April she was caring for an elderly man who was dying of respiratory failure because of COVID-19. That day his physicians had decided to transition to providing comfort care rather than pursuing aggressive treatments. The patient had one close family member living nearby but that person was unable to come to the hospital. So he was alone. Becca said “It’s always hard for me to see people dying alone. Part of the heartbreak is that I’m often super-busy and I just can’t be with them the whole time.” That day however Becca’s care load was unusually light. She spent as much time as she could with the dying man trying to keep him comfortable praying silently under her breath. Then one of the physicians came by to check on the man and consult with Becca. After the doctor left she popped her head back in the room a moment later and said “I found out he’s a Christian. I just wanted to let you know. I don’t know if you share the same beliefs but I wanted to give you a heads-up.” Becca was surprised. She doesn’t know that doctor very well and they’ve never discussed faith. “There’s no way she knew I was a Christian. It’s not a topic that comes up much in the hospital setting.” So when she heard those words out of the blue Becca felt a jolt. “It was like someone hitting me over the head. I knew it was the Holy Spirit. I felt a freedom to be bolder.” Becca closed the curtain around the patient’s bed to get some privacy stood close to him and held his hand. He was starting to slip out of consciousness. Bending to his ear Becca told him that she heard he was a Christian that she was a Christian too and that she was going to pray with him. “I prayed out loud asking the Holy Spirit to be with him and I traced a cross on his forehead.” Becca was able to be with the man most of the time he was dying holding his hand and continuing to pray. He appeared calm and peaceful. Her other patient that day didn’t need much care. “That was another way I saw the Lord as he carved out that time for me to be with this patient who was dying.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7719

7696,May 19 2020 4:20 p.m.,“We Lost the Children and Now They’re Back”,Ann Brown and Pam Seale at the bench unveiling. Photo by Mary Kay Gleason. by Elizabeth Grams Two weeks ago on the South Side of Indianapolis brothers from the Christians in Mission team unveiled a new feature in the Karcher Street green space: the first of two handcrafted wooden park benches. On each bench an inscription carved into the backrest bears the name of Ann Brown.  Ann moved into her house on Union Street in the mid-1940s. She remembers that when she was young the neighborhood was full of Christian families most of them members of the neighborhood church Sacred Heart with children playing in the streets. Since then she had seen the neighborhood change to a place where someone could (and did) get into her home and steal her TV and where prostitution violence and drug abuse were going on right outside her door.  She prayed for the neighborhood. Ann a lifelong Catholic has a strong faith which was deepened by her involvement in the charismatic renewal during the early 1970s. At that time she had been struggling with a long illness. A Baptist friend encouraged her to accept Christ Jesus as her Lord and Savior. Ann mulled that over getting used to the new idea and she started attending charismatic prayer meetings. She gave her life to the Lord during a Life in the Spirit Seminar.  She has never forgotten the day in 2008 when two People of Praise missionaries Mary Timler and Ellen (Putzier) Earhart knocked on her door. Ann began coming to the prayer meetings the missionaries hosted in their homes. She told them they were the answer to her prayers.  It wasn’t long before she started calling her new People of Praise friends her family. After more of them began to move into houses on her block Mike Coney would take her trash to the road and shovel her snow. (He also helped her replace that stolen TV.) Ann would often sit with community members at church. She started delivering Christmas cookies to every People of Praise household.  Robin Gonzalez remembers how Ann prophesied to the People of Praise back when Karcher Street was still a dark alley home to drug deals and lined with broken-down houses “Your village will be like it used to be when kids were biking up and down the street and the sound of kids’ laughter will be heard in the streets.”   South Side girls group. Photo from V&B archives. Today Ann’s home borders the Karcher Street green space and sits next door to the home of Abe and Trish Olson and their children. Ann often sits on her porch so she can watch children play. She knows the names of all the CIM children and keeps treats for them in her home.  “I always think of Ann when I hear our kids squealing and carrying on out there” Robin says with a laugh. “I tell her look Ann it’s like you said!” As Ann’s hearing loss has grown more severe she has been unable to attend church or community gatherings but sisters visit with her often and have a rolling exchange of sweets with her.   Boys play at Action summer camp 2018. Photo from V&B archives. A few years ago Pam Seale began to stop in on Ann regularly to help her out around the house taking her to doctor appointments and guiding her through exercises to help with her arthritis. (Pam has a background in geriatric nursing.) Ann insisted on paying despite Pam’s protests. Pam set the money aside not knowing what to do with it. Early this April it struck her that she could use it both to give Custom Cottage some business and to honor Ann at the same time. She asked Ann if she could use the money to commission a pair of park benches for the green space. They would be a place Ann could sit closer to the children she loved but also open to anyone. Ann agreed. On May 3 the entire CIM team gathered for the unveiling of the first new bench in the green space just behind Ann’s home. Rus Lyons and George Kane whisked off a drop cloth to loud applause revealing a brand-spanking new bench. A beaming Ann took the first seat. She hopes that the benches can be used by many others like mothers holding babies.  “This is a good neighborhood” Ann says. “We lost the children and now they’re back.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7696
7690,May 15 2020 2:30 p.m.,Mask-Making Method,"By Elizabeth Pease Early in the Covid-19 outbreak Mary Timler (Evansville)  anticipated a need. She says “We thought ‘What if someone in our household got sick?’ We would go through those disposable masks really quickly. Making masks that could be washed and re-worn was really attractive.”  As a nurse Mary had worn surgical masks for work and she knew what she liked and didn’t like. She did some digging on the internet and found a pattern that fits tightly to ensure you’re breathing through the fabric and has adjustable ties that will fit different sizes of faces.  Last week we profiled a number of sisters in the community who are sewing masks to share with others including Mary and her household member Ellen Reed. You can read that story here.  If you are interested in learning to make masks yourself and are looking for some good tips here are the results of Mary’s research on the masks that are working for the missionaries (see also the video above). There are many other patterns and tutorials available on the internet. Mary’s Tips: ●  The mask design we’re using is based on this tutorial from the University of Arizona. A quilter and a nurse got together to design the mask. This pattern uses only one strap in a clever way. I think the fit is even better with just one strap than two! https://www.nursing.arizona.edu/news/uarizona-nursing-volunteers-fine-tune-homemade-face-masks-address-shortage-issues●  I made a couple of masks with two layers of quilter’s cotton but when I held them up to the light I could see through them. To get a tight enough weave for good protection we’re using two layers of 100% cotton on the outside with a layer of flannel in between. Many mask makers recommend using three layers of fabric. They could be three layers of cotton or two layers of cotton with a lining of flannel or non-woven interfacing in between.  Having the flannel on the inside prevents pilling. ●  We’ve left the nose clip part out of the University of Arizona design and added the extra layer of flannel. ●  Our design avoids using elastic which is hard to get and may break down in the wash over time and the single tie makes it adjustable to fit different people. It makes a good seal so you’re breathing through the fabric is easy to sew and launders well. The one con is that some people may not like the feel of so much fabric on their faces and the three layers can make it uncomfortable to breathe through for those with underlying health conditions. If you have asthma or another breathing condition better to go with just two or three layers of cotton.●  Whenever possible use new unused fabric. 100% cotton tightly woven. Wash and dry before sewing.●  Other patterns often don’t include seam allowance. Most intend for 1/4"" seam allowance.●  If you’re making a lot of masks work in stages. For example cut out the fabric for all the masks and then move on to the next step and do that for all the masks. ●  Generally 10 masks can be made from one yard of fabric depending on the pattern.  Two 7 inch pieces of 1/4 inch elastic are needed for each mask.  Or you can use fabric to make your own ties. ●  Using contrasting fabric for the front and back of the mask helps distinguish the inside from the outside.  This is especially helpful if you remove the mask and plan to put it back on.  You want to make sure the side against your face is not what was on the outside of the mask. Make sure to launder your masks in between uses. We’ve been wearing them every day and they hold up well!The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public primarily to prevent the wearer from spreading covid-19 to others particularly because someone can be infected with the virus but not know it. If you’d like more information on face coverings from the CDC including how to make them wear them and generally use them you can find guidelines tips and frequently asked questions on their website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7690

By Chris Meehan Joe and Cynthia Hagens (Servant Branch) recently endured a four-week dry spell in their home-remodeling business J.J. Hagens Inc. due to the pandemic. It was a double whammy—some customers were leery about spending money on renovations when their jobs weren't secure and others who might have been willing to spend the money were leery of strangers working in their house potentially bringing the coronavirus with them. The pandemic affected the business in other ways as well. For instance the lumberyard that Joe had purchased all his materials from for over 40 years closed permanently.  Fortunately he was able to establish a connection with a new lumberyard in time to order some supplies for a few clients. Joe says that building a good working relationship with a lumberyard is a significant step in maintaining a successful construction and remodeling business.  “We always pray daily for God to provide for our needs in general but after almost four weeks of no work and no income one Wednesday Cynthia and I specifically prayed for jobs to work on. The very next day I got two calls for jobs that customers wanted us to start on right away! One was remodeling a kitchen the other renovating a bathroom” Joe says. Then the kitchen remodelers got cold feet and put the job on hold. Both the husband and wife were concerned about the pandemic situation affecting their jobs in the airline industry. But a few days after postponing the project indefinitely  they decided to go ahead with it. Meanwhile Joe and Cynthia were able to start on the bathroom renovation right away. When that was done they were ready to move on to the kitchen project. “Since then there’s been a steady stream of jobs coming our way” says Joe. “Praise the Lord!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7679
7660,May 12 2020 1:46 p.m.,Dan Robinson,by Dan Brewer I met Dan in the late 1970s in San Francisco. He was so serious about living the gospel of Jesus in his daily life that he’d left his job at Boeing in Seattle and moved down to join our charismatic community—only to discover that we were moving soon to South Bend to join the People of Praise. At our branch meetings here Dan regularly shared the insights of his prayer and his meditation on Scripture. He served for many years in music ministry. He took every opportunity for prayer and fellowship and never wanted to miss any men’s group meetings or headship meetings. He was forever reading and talking about books he’d read: Scripture science theology nature and the saints. He liked discussing conferences talks movies videos or films—all with an eye to learning more about God and his world. Dan and Marylen devoted their lives to each other and to their children. For 29 years before retiring in 2012 Dan worked at Saint Mary's College in information technology. After retiring he was limited in the service work he could do because of the pain and physical limitations of his lifelong struggle with cerebral palsy so he sent out email reflections about his faith. He was contemplating a blog hoping to help a wider audience in their walk with God. He was also helping teach the initiation program at his parish. Raised in a military family Dan had moved a dozen or more times growing up. Once he moved here in 1977 the People of Praise became his home.   FACTS●  Dan was born June 26 1946 in Brooklyn NY at the U.S. Naval Hospital. He died unexpectedly in South Bend December 1 2019. ●  After a year in a minor seminary he completed high school and college  in California.● Dan made the covenant of the People of Praise April 6 1980.●  On June 4 1988 Dan and covenanted member Marylen Fromherz were married. They raised two children Irene and Ted. Irene is a member of the Vancouver-Portland branch .,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7660
7517,May 12 2020 1:07 p.m.,Joe Klein,by Jim Benda Joe worked at careers in real estate sales and management and with the State of Minnesota Workforce Centers as a job search counselor and as a resource person supporting small businesses in Minnesota. Beyond that he was an artist and creator like his Father in heaven. He made finely crafted walking sticks. Jim Rolland describes Joe as a very gifted musician serving weekly with music ministry at prayer meetings and also at local regional and national conferences. His rich resonant baritone voice filled any room. He was also an accomplished trumpet player. Inspired by the Holy Spirit he wrote songs one of which was published in the original Sing Our Your Praise community songbook. Joe was a force behind Servant Quarters the dinner theater that our branch ran for several years. He served with our evangelistic music outreach Servant Song which performed at churches festivals and conferences. Joe’s spontaneous comedic persona brought sidesplitting laughter and tears of joy to any audience. His antics at music conferences Steubenville youth conferences and dinner theaters brought down the house. Will DeSanto adds “When Joe spoke his love for Jesus and his family were primary. He helped me when I was struggling by sharing a word of wisdom and encouragement. And he called me when he needed to pray for his family and for his concerns. We prayed over the phone.” Jim adds that Joe “was always a generous thoughtful kind loyal man of God a lover of Jesus and a dear brother to me.”   FACTS●  Joe was born in Blue Springs Nebraska April 26 1942 and died in hospice care August 8 2019 in Edina Minnesota.●  He was raised in Wymore Nebraska and in high school displayed talents for woodworking art acting and music. He played Sherlock Holmes in his senior play.●  Joe moved from Nebraska to Minnesota in 1966 started attending prayer meetings and joined Servants of the Light community in the early 1970s.●  Joe and Bonnie Knott were married during a January 2 1981 snowstorm. Together they lived out their marriage vows in faithfulness to the Lord and raised three children and there are now four grandchildren. They made the People of Praise covenant on January 27 1985.

7640,May 8 2020 2:16 p.m.,Face Masks Here There and Everywhere,"By Elizabeth Pease Bring on the quilters sewers and seamstresses! Across the community sisters are using their creative skills and artistic flair to serve their neighbors and help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Just in the (by no means exhaustive) search for mask-makers we did for this story we identified around 860 masks made by People of Praise sewers! Here’s a round up of pictures and stories from this new frontier of service: The Mask Lady  Connie Schrandt models her ""homage to Iowa corn” mask. Photo by Connie Schrandt. When Connie Schrandt (Servant Branch) heard about people making masks at home to donate to health-care workers she decided to go into production. A prolific quilter she had lots of extra fabric and thread on hand but only a little elastic. Fortunately she got some more from nearby community members. After checking with the caretaker of her building she put some of her masks out in the mailroom anonymously for her neighbors. Those masks were hot—they disappeared as fast as she could replenish them! Then word got around the building about who was making the masks and Connie started getting thank-you notes and soon people in the building were offering her more fabric and more elastic. Connie was able to let the donors know how many more masks their donations had turned into. Connie moved into the building relatively recently and she’s wanted to get to know more people. She says “When I meet someone in the elevator or common area they will ask if I am the ‘mask lady’ and express their gratitude.” The caretaker of the adjacent building heard about the masks and asked Connie to make some for their mailroom too. Connie estimates that she’s made over 250 masks for her neighbors and various donation efforts. Keeping it in the Ohana  Joan Hiel and her daughters deliver masks from China to the Oahu branch. Photo by Bob Badham. In Oahu a young Chinese couple spent three years living on the island. They are underground Christians who attended branch meetings during their time on Oahu. When branch member Whit Au died in February they were disappointed that they couldn’t leave China for his funeral so they sent over 400 disposable masks instead. Says Joan Hiel “My daughters and I drove around the island to deliver Ziploc bags full of Christ’s love in the shape of masks to our Hawaiian ohana (family) from our Chinese brother and sister in Christ who are People of Praise members in their hearts.”  Hawaiian print masks made by Bev Linczer.

Photo courtesy of Linda Jo Devlaeminck. Linda Jo Devlaeminck (Vancouver-Portland) has made masks for the staff and residents of Community of Hope the homeless shelter she runs. Community of Hope can provide shelter classes mentoring and community life for eight homeless single-parent families for four to six months. Many branch members donate funds and volunteer there. Linda Jo got a pattern for masks from Jo Marie Hansen put together some fabric scraps and went to work. Some of the staff asked for their favorite colors and if Linda Jo had the right fabric she was happy to oblige. “Since we have a lot of kids that don’t get not hugging we do not practice physical distancing at home” Linda Jo says. “That makes it easier on them because they are less isolated. Many of the residents go for daily walks together and are a lot of support to each other. Many are in outpatient drug treatment and do their meetings and counseling via their phones and Zoom. A few work. Everyone washes their hands well when they enter the house.” A Brigade of Mask Makers  The King family as outfitted by Nadine Reinhardt used their new masks to help serve food at a local homeless shelter. Photo by Thomas King. In River Hills a suburban neighborhood where many Servant Branch members live a loose network of at least 10 branch women and some other neighbors have been making masks for family friends neighbors and various charitable causes as well as swapping tips and supplies. Adella Wacker (Servant Branch) responded to a Facebook request for masks from Little Sisters of the Poor a group of nuns who run a care home for the elderly where Adella had worked for 20 years before retiring. Adella Christine Brickweg and Kathy Coleman made masks for the residents and staff that helped fill their need until they were able to get commercial masks on back order. Nadine Reinhardt (Servant Branch) who has a background in sewing professionally has outfitted friends and family with masks and donated to a few different causes for a total of over 100 masks. She had saved over 60 yards of quarter-inch elastic from a job she finished 10 years ago not sure how she would ever use it. She says “The Lord always provides. Who knew that today it would prove to be a precious coveted gem? Two other ladies in my neighborhood have benefitted from my archive.”  Peg Daly noticed a re-purposed Little Free Library in her neighborhood at a church where she does landscaping with master gardeners. Photo by Peg Daly. Peg Daly’s (Servant Branch) corner of River Hills boasts a longstanding set of active friendships among neighbors. They’ve collaborated on crafting projects in the past like making pillowcases for the Red Cross. Peg was able to swap with a neighbor—her elastic in exchange for fabric with birds on it—a strategy to get her 90-year-old bird-loving mother to wear a mask. “It’s been a really unifying thing for the neighborhood.” Also in Servant Branch Carolyn Reinhardt saw on a neighborhood email chain that a man was offering fabric to anyone willing to make masks. Carolyn asked him if he would like her to make him a mask and he said yes so she did. This gave her the idea of offering to make masks for other neighbors. As she made each mask she prayed for the person who would be wearing it and she delivered them in Ziploc bags with a note explaining the washing instructions and saying that she’d prayed for the wearers. “I ended up making masks for a neighbor’s workplace and he won a prize for one of them (definitely a first sewing prize for me a novice seamstress)!"" Masks for Missionaries and Neighbors Soon after news of the spread of COVID-19 reached Evansville missionary and nurse Mary Timler anticipated that the missionaries might need face masks especially if someone in the household got sick. She did some research into what mask design might work best for her household’s needs and budget and found an easy one with ties that didn’t require elastic. Ellen Reed an experienced sewer helped get an assembly line going and eventually took over the sewing. The missionaries haven’t been visiting neighbors but have been phoning them instead. That’s how some neighbors found out that Ellen was making masks and a few have asked if she could make masks for them. Ellen was happy to oblige! In Allendale Abby Earhart has used the pattern Mary found to make masks for a few neighbors there too. Masks Just in Time In South Bend Andrea Kane noticed a plea for masks from Our Lady of the Road a ministry for the homeless run by the Catholic Worker. They needed masks for their clients many of whom are in poor health. On the phone with her friend Lisa who had served as a missionary in China for many years Andrea heard that Lisa had received 100 face masks in the mail from their mutual friend Lily in China. Lily had served as a missionary with Lisa for many years. Andrea says “I asked Lisa ‘What did you do with all those masks?’ She replied ‘Well they are sitting right here. Want some?’ ‘Yes! I know who really needs them’” The next day Lisa dropped off a big stack of masks at Andrea’s house and Andrea’s husband Paul took them down to Our Lady of the Road.

7600,May 5 2020 10:22 a.m.,Playlist: Easter Joy,This second Easter playlist includes some songs you may have sung or heard and others you have probably not—including several written and performed by brothers and sisters in the community. The collection of seven songs progresses through all the drama and emotions of that first Easter—above all joy!Listen on our YouTube playlist or by scrolling down.1. We begin with Molly Barrett’s (South Bend) “Homage to the King” recorded in 1982 which moves from the hush of Holy Saturday to the glorious sunrise on Easter morning.      2.  Next is Don Francisco’s “He’s Alive!” a ballad about the day of the Lord’s resurrection written from the perspective of the apostle Peter performed live by Dolly Parton and a gospel choir.     3. Lindell Cooley leads the Brownsville Assembly of God choir in a rendition of “Saved” (written by Bob Dylan and Tim Drummond) which is almost impossible for me to hear while remaining still.     4. & 5. The South Bend music ministry performs “Rise Up King Jesus” by Louis Grams (Servant Branch) followed by “Parte de Pascua” by Jim Grondin (South Bend).        6. “Domine Fili Unigenite” from Vivaldi’s Gloria is about the closest musical approximation to gleeful skipping I’ve ever heard.     7. “Welcome Happy Morning!” is a lovely old Easter hymn played simply here on piano and capturing the impact of Christ’s Easter greeting to his disciples: “Peace be with you.” This recording is taken from the soundtrack to Terrence Malick’s film The Tree of Life.    Listen to our first Easter playlist here.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7600
7570,May 1 2020 12:33 p.m.,Trinity Students Create Amazing Chain Reaction,Watch original video with additional slow mo shots   by Chris Meehan Trinity School at Greenlawn students Jacob (18) Josh (13) and Justin (12) Heintzelman are the first-place winners of the recent Rube Goldberg machine competition held by Trinity Schools Inc. With their mom Kristin operating a camera their sister Gloria (16) helping set up and their dad Eric offering helpful suggestions the boys managed to create a remarkably long and complex chain reaction involving a lego spaceship on a string dominoes marbles trains a crossbow a flying hammer a pinewood derby car and ultimately a cell phone rigged to take a picture of the boys. (You have to see it to believe it!) The boys ended up taking over a large part of their basement and had to move furniture and other stored items out of the way. Gloria collected books from the Trinity curriculum to stack as supports for different parts of the track. “We did our first full test run on Wednesday night (April 22) but we didn't get very far” says Jacob. “After our schoolwork on Thursday we went back to work on it and finally got it to work all the way through at 11:30 pm. “One particularly difficult part to accomplish was getting the car to hit the train. Also getting to the part where the crowbar fell onto the crossbow and shot the ink cartridge and having it actually hit the target. That took a long time to get right!” The cross-campus competition is one part of Trinity’s efforts to use the sojourn into distance learning to the students’ benefit. As of early April the three Trinity campuses began to share an online collection of art poetry music math and science gathered by or created by its own faculty and students. It’s called The Dailies. “The Dailies is a place where students from all grades at all campuses have the chance to see poems of the day artwork of the day works of music contests and other enrichment activities. Comments are welcome but not required. There are no assignments. This is learning in its highest freest and purest sense” said Jon Balsbaugh the president of Trinity Schools. Trinity also hosts competitions through the site. The Rube Goldberg machine building contest was the first. As a prize the Heintzelman boys shared an Amazon gift card and a book entitled How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems. The second competition began yesterday and involves reproducing a famous piece of art.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7570
7572,April 30 2020 4:23 p.m.,Seeing the Lord Through the Coronavirus,by Catherine Bulger When Patrice Delanty (Colorado Springs) spiked a fever in March after several days of other symptoms she called her doctor. Coronavirus tests weren’t available but her doctor diagnosed her with COVID-19 based on her symptoms and advised her to stay home and monitor her illness. Patrice 61 moved to Colorado Springs a few months ago to be near her son Ben LaBadie  and his wife Abby after the birth of their son her first grandchild. Ben and Abby are members of the Colorado Springs branch and Patrice came underway in the branch in January. She works for a consulting company called Denali as a Senior Sourcing Associate. In the days that followed her diagnosis—as symptoms increased and fever and fatigue came and went—Patrice kept closely in touch with her doctor. He advised her to call 911 if she started gasping for breath or if other symptoms worsened. Patrice felt peaceful about that general plan. “Overall my uncertainty before getting sick was worse than the reality.” But one night she got scared. She was struggling to take a deep breath to find a position that was comfortable enough to fall asleep. She wasn’t gasping for air but she was worried. “How would I know when I was bad enough to go to the hospital? What if I passed out? Who would find me?” Patrice lives alone with no one right there to check on her. Patrice told the Lord you need to tell me when I need to raise the alarm. “That night I was feeling sorry for myself even angry: here I am in the year 2020 having to battle a potentially life-threatening illness on my own. Why did I have to be the one to decide whether my symptoms were bad enough? I don’t think I ever felt so alone in my entire life as I did at that moment. “So I gave it to the Lord; I had no one else to turn to. And then I felt the Lord instantly draw near to me intimately and completely close—I could almost feel his arms holding me.” Then Patrice recalled an image the Lord had given her in prayer just before falling ill. “I was swimming in a deep lake with murky waters similar to the Oregon lakes where I went camping with my dad and siblings. I was swimming underwater and tried to swim to the surface to take a breath. It seemed a long way up and I was running out of air. Right then I suddenly felt two strong arms lift me up out of the water and I landed in an inflatable lifeboat safe and sound.” At first she thought this vision meant she wouldn’t get the virus. But later lying in bed and crying out to the Lord Patrice realized “He knew in advance the exact moment when I would need his strong arms to pull me out of the deep waters of my fear and illness. I knew in that moment that I was going to be okay. Only then did my panic subside and I finally fell asleep in his arms.” That night was the worst and Patrice gradually began to recover. Today she’s been fever-free for a couple of weeks and is getting her energy back. Her major organs have suffered no damage. She hopes to go for antibody tests that may prove she did have COVID-19 and possibly enable her to help other sufferers by donating plasma. In the past few weeks Patrice has been able to share the Lord’s mercy to her and encourage people who are afraid. Co-workers have called her to talk about symptoms or simply to express their anxieties. When Patrice shares about the Lord they listen Christians or not. “People are scared and they’re hungry and they want to hear about the Lord.” She has good friends who normally steer well clear of any religious talk. Recently after she’d posted some thoughts on Facebook they called her wanting to talk about faith.  Patrice is grateful for the outpouring of support she received from her family and from the branch. She says she was inundated with meals flowers and other supplies left on her doorstep as well as a flood of calls emails texts and words of encouragement. “They were amazing” she says of her People of Praise brothers and sisters. “I wish everyone had this!” Most of all Patrice says “I want my illness to encourage people not to be afraid. That’s high on my heart: God will give you what you need the moment you need it each step of the way. Regardless of where you are you’ll be given what you need.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7572

Singing in the Spirit We note in the video that singing together in Zoom (unless all but one singer are muted) is a recipe for cacaphony due to time lags. However several brothers and sisters have found that singing or praying in the Spirit can work in a Zoom meeting even with everyone unmuted because staying together doesn't matter as much. Some who have tried praying together in this way found it to be life giving!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7506

7460,April 24 2020 3:38 p.m.,The Biggest Virtual Lord's Day Ever?,by Chris Meehan It started out as a small idea a seed planted by two dads chatting together on the instant messaging service called Slack. Why not use videoconferencing to get their families together and try sharing a Lord’s Day opening and meal in a virtual way? It wouldn’t matter that one of the families the Stapps lives in Minnesota and the other the Rodriguezes lives in Kingston. Soon the seed started to grow. Mike Stapp and Kevin Rodriguez wondered if we can celebrate the Lord’s Day with people from Kingston then why not Hawaii too? And why not add a few other places? Last Saturday about 85 people in nine different locations and five different time zones from Hawaii to northern Virginia came together on a Zoom video call. They prayed “Blessed are you O Lord our God King of the Universe. . . .” They ate—well most of them ate. It was still midafternoon in Hawaii. After dinner some even stayed to play a game. The event began with 30 minutes of informal hanging out on Zoom as brothers and sisters said hello and greeted one another across the miles. Rob and Laura Brickweg (Servant Branch) led the Lord’s Day opening prayers. Mike managed the technology and he and his wife Sarah served as the hosts for the gathering. After the initial prayers Mike used Zoom’s feature of breakout rooms to divide everybody into smaller groups where they could talk in a more personal way. Each small group spent 20 minutes together and then Mike switched the groups around and everyone spent 20 minutes with a different small group (all randomly assigned). Later everybody came together again as one group and then they divided up one more time. This final time participants could choose a smaller group to be part of. One group was dedicated to playing a game called Code Names.  The event was a hit. The next day Pat Clark (Vancouver-Portland) wrote in to say “I have a tangible sense today following our cross-globe Lord's Day last evening that we are more perfectly unified! Imagine—a global pandemic draws brothers and sisters closer to one another. Glory to God!” “It was lovely to reconnect with folks from other branches” added Maile Schunk (northern Virginia). “I hadn’t connected with any of the folks from Minnesota or Portland for years and I met some new people as well. It was fun and refreshing. I look forward to the next one!” “We were honored to be included in what felt like a real Lord’s Day opening” Alana Busekrus (Oahu) said. “Mike and Sarah’s facilitation of the meeting with introductions smaller groups and the provision of the script (Lord’s Day ceremony) in advance all helped it flow smoothly and allowed flexibility to participate as your time zone and schedule permitted. We loved seeing friends—who feel like family even more than ever—from afar.” Kevin Rodriguez (Kingston) wrote “We got to meet the wives and children of brothers I have come to know through conferences like the PTI and TRS. It was such an honour to be with my brothers and sisters. This pandemic has been a blessing pushing us to explore alternatives to connect and share our lives. Glory to God! My three children were eager to share their art with the group and to be introduced to other children in the community. My eldest Nathaniel (12) commented after ‘That was one of the best Lord's Day celebrations.’” The Stapps are already planning another virtual gathering for this Saturday and they hope to do more in the future.  Aside from seeing brothers and sisters what was the next best feature of a virtual Lord’s Day opening? Nobody had to do dishes for 85!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7460
7446,April 21 2020 3:53 p.m.,Top Ten Tips for Zoom Rockstars (Part One),Now that you've gotten the basics of virtual meetings under your belt here are a few tips for additional security when using Zoom.  Zoom Intro Google Duo Intro How to Protect your Security While Using Zoom Don’t share your meeting information publiclyDon’t share the link to your meeting or the meeting ID number with anyone you don’t want to show up at your meeting. The direct link to your Zoom meeting doesn’t belong on Facebook or anywhere else that’s public. Use a meeting passwordAs of April 5 meetings now require a password by default. If your attendees join by clicking on a meeting link they won’t see any difference but attendees joining my entering the meeting ID on the Zoom website will now need to enter the password as well. The password will appear in the text of the Zoom invitation following the meeting ID number.  Use the waiting roomAlso as of April 5 meetings now have the waiting room turned on by default. It allows you to approve attendees before they enter your meeting. As the host in a meeting you’ll see a notification next to the Manage Participants button on the menu when one or more of your participants are in the waiting room. Click the “Admit” button from the notification or go to the Manage Participants panel and click the “Admit” button next to their names to let them in.  From the Manage Participants panel you can also remove people in the waiting room from the meeting instead of letting them in or move people already in the meeting back to the waiting room by clicking on the “More” menu next to their names. Change the file names of recorded meetings and save them in private locationsUse good judgement around recording meetings. You should only record meetings if all the participants agree or if it’s a larger meeting that’s usually recorded like a branch meeting.  Meetings that are recorded to the Zoom cloud and remain on the Zoom server are protected behind a password and not publicly available.  If you record a meeting to your local computer or download a recording file from the Zoom cloud be careful how and where you share it.  You should give any recorded Zoom meetings that you upload to another cloud service a new file name so that they aren’t easily searchable online - call them something other than the default “zoom_0”. Make sure that you understand the privacy settings of any cloud or video hosting services you load the file to - files in Google Drive or Dropbox that are set up for link sharing (rather than sharing with specific people) may be publically searched if you don’t have your settings set to private. YouTube videos are public by default unless you specifically make them private. Limit screen sharing to the host (esp. in larger meetings)With the security precautions above it will be very rare that someone joins your meeting who shouldn’t. However limiting screen sharing to the host only in larger meetings can prevent someone else taking control of your meeting to display unwanted content.  On the “My Account” page click on “Settings” and then “In Meeting (Basic)”. Scroll down to screen sharing and then click “Host only” under “Who can share?” With this setting on only the host or a designated co-host will be able to share their screen in a meeting.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7446
7430,April 17 2020 10:08 a.m.,Boy Scouts Gather Food for the Hungry,by Chris Meehan Larry Grauvogel (South Bend) a long-time leader in Boy Scout Troop 325 sponsored by the South Bend branch recognizes an opportunity when he sees one.  A few weeks ago he noticed a flyer advertising a small neighborhood food drive. He made a phone call and found out that the Food Bank of Northern Indiana was 135000 pounds shy of its goal.  The shortage was partially caused by the cancellation of annual nationwide food drives by the Boy Scouts and by US Postal Service mail carriers. He thought to himself: Our Boy Scouts should be able to do something about that.  After consulting with local Scout authorities Larry sent out an email to the parents and boys of Troop 325 asking for volunteers to conduct a food drive in their own neighborhoods. They were quick to say yes. “We got 18 different family units to cover 17 neighborhoods—that was a large area of the city. A total of 38 people—17 adults and 21 Scouts—participated” Larry said.  Larry emailed an explanatory flyer for volunteer families to print and to distribute the Monday before Easter. With permission they printed the food bank’s logo on the flyer making it clear that they were directly serving the essential mission of the food bank. (According to Indiana guidelines allowable essential activities include “activities needed for sustenance necessities of life… and as necessary to take care of others while applying social distancing requirements.) Scoutmaster John Loughran his sons Peter (16) and Michael (14) and Josh Rose (15) dropped off flyers at 75 homes on Monday and gathered up food on Thursday. John recalls one funny moment as he went around looking for food packages on porches. He sent one son up to a house that had three bags of food on the porch but he had second thoughts when he discovered the bags held fresh vegetables. John took the bags back to the house and found out the bags contained just-delivered food from a grocery store. “We all got a laugh out of that!” Josh Heintzelman (13) and his brother Justin (12) went to several subdivisions with their mother Kristin and distributed over 100 flyers. Justin pointed out that they were careful not to put the flyers directly in mailboxes. They returned on Thursday picked up the donations and helped unload them at the branch center’s parking lot where people organized labeled and consolidated the food. Scout Nick Kottkamp (16) distributed 48 flyers in his neighborhood on Monday then on Thursday went around the neighborhood with his younger brother Peter (14) also a Scout collecting the food packages off porches. “We wore gloves while picking up the food and masks and gloves when unloading and reloading at the branch center” he said. Neighbors were eager to donate the food and were calling in to make sure their donation was picked up. Some attached notes to the packages thanking the Scouts for their service. Results exceeded Larry’s expectations. “Altogether we collected 3047 pounds of food (2909 items) plus another $250 in cash for the food bank. The staff there was ecstatic when we brought it all over. The grandest donation I noticed was a container of Lysol disinfectant wipes. That has to be the hardest commodity to find during this coronavirus siege and perhaps worth its weight in gold.” “You just never know how the Lord will move” Larry says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7430

7345,April 7 2020 2:38 p.m.,The Gospel of Mark,"""Christ in the Wilderness"" by Ivan Kramskoy by Chris Meehan “I’m so tired. Would it be like suicide if I just gave up on treatment?” The weary worn-out man looked David Katcher straight in the eye and posed his sad question. Mark was only 63 but he looked older sitting in his wheelchair in the Evansville IN hospital wearing an ill-fitting gown connected to an oxygen tube and with dialysis scheduled three times a week. “He was clearly in pain and exhausted most of the time but he always wanted us to come see him” Lily Zusi one of David’s fellow missionaries recalled. When Mark asked David about giving up David immediately had a clear sense that Christ was in Mark suffering and weeping as he had in the Garden of Gethsemane. He shared this with Mark. Apparently stunned Mark gasped and fell silent. He took a few minutes to rally himself then responded with a firm “I'm not going to despair.”  Later he said “I’ve decided instead I want to tell people about what God has done for me. But who can I tell when I’m stuck in here?”  The medical technician in the room chimed in. “You can tell me!” Six months earlier Mark and his wife had moved into a house about 50 yards from the missionary men’s home. “We began to visit them regularly” says David. As time went on they all got to know one another better and in the summer the missionaries brought them vegetables from their farm. The missionaries continued to visit Mark weekly when he went into the hospital. Conversation inevitably turned to spiritual matters and Mark shared his story. He’d been raised in an orphanage run by Jesuits but hadn’t been to church in years. Still he wanted to get right with God. Mark said he had come close to death three times. He believed that God had spared him to save him from going to hell. Now he was hungry for God. The missionaries found out that Mark’s nurse was Pentecostal and that she’d shared her testimony with him. During one visit Isaac Willard and Lily told Mark about baptism in the Holy Spirit. He wanted it. Isaac and Lily called David who joined them in prayer over the phone.  On one of their later visits Mark said he wasn’t sure if baptism in the Holy Spirit had had any impact on his life. David reminded him that the morning after he’d been prayed with Mark had convinced his nurse to take him down to the hospital chapel to pray and he’d had a real conversation with God for the first time in a decade. David told him it sounded as if the Holy Spirit was indeed at work in him. It was after yet another unsuccessful attempt to leave the hospital that Mark had asked David about quitting his treatment. His wife had moved to be with her daughter in Nashville due to her own bad health and Mark was discouraged. David’s words about Christ grieving in him made a real difference to Mark. One day Mark admitted that he was holding a grudge against a granddaughter who had stolen money from him and his wife to buy drugs. He couldn't bring himself to forgive her. David asked him “Mark if you die without being reconciled with her what do you think of that situation?” He acknowledged it would be a big mistake and in a phone call his wife agreed. So Mark reconciled with his granddaughter. The next day on February 17 he died.  “I miss him” David said. ""He became a good friend. It’s like losing a family member. He gives me hope for the resurrection. I look forward to seeing him again.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7345

George and Arlene Meyerhofer hosted the ceremony while everyone else participated on mute except when they had a reading to contribute. During the meal portion Peter split everyone into four groups via Zoom's ""breakout rooms"" so people could eat together in smaller groups. Several branch members reported that they particularly enjoyed the conversations over dinner. After the meal the whole branch came back together for closing prayers.  from Arlene Meyerhofer Peter says ""We had a few members call in from landlines.  One sister could not figure out how to flip her camera so she stuck a picture of herself on her foot.  Several brothers were sporting their new “work from home beards”. There was plenty of clever and humorous participation to help us enjoy one another!"" His wife Sarah adds ""It wasn't ideal but it was worth it to see one another 'face to face'."" Ruth Broxup sent an email to the branch afterwards that read in part ""I hadn't realized how much I miss our time together.

7271,April 3 2020 3:25 p.m.,From Sorrow to Singing,"""Christ With Two Disciples"" by Rembrandt In a chapter called “The Meaning of the Psalms” the Coptic monk Matthew the Poor writes “the Psalms transform the state of sorrow in our hearts into a state of prayer.” (See his book Words for Our Time.) He continues “Once you begin a psalm and detect the touch of the Spirit you will know it to be an inward call to prayer as well as permission from heaven to speak before God.” Many inspired songs hymns and spirituals work in much the same way. They give us permission to speak in a certain way and the best songs give us the words to use when we can’t seem to find the right words ourselves. One of my favorite spirituals is called “I’m Going To Tell God All of My Troubles.” I especially admire the version by the soprano Beatrice Rippy who is accompanied by her husband Carroll Hollister on the piano. “I’m going to tell God all of my troubles when I get home” Rippy sings. “I’m going to tell him the road was rocky.”  A friend can speak to a friend with this kind of honesty and directness.  The singer finds her footing through knowing and believing that God is a friend like this one she can tell her troubles to. She responds to him generously “I’m gonna live so God can use me ‘til I get home.” Today we bring you a variety of psalms and psalm-like songs from U2 to Ralph Vaughan Williams to an Aramaic chant to our own missionaries even a song of my own from a few years back. Perhaps one of these will resonate with you but if the first song doesn’t just move on to the next one as Matthew the Poor advises us to do with the Psalms: “You pass by one psalm then another until you arrive at a particular one that arouses your soul and an inner stirring occurs mingled with great joy.” May you find great joy today in psalms and in song.

7221,April 1 2020 4:29 p.m.,Try a Little Kindness,by Reverend Charles Harris C.S.C Today as we appreciate the vastness of the universe we experience our ownsmallness and our own weakness. A tiny mosquito can bear a deadly disease. An elephant can do things which baffle our strength. Yet there is one power which through the action of the Holy Spirit we can possess and these creatures do not. This is the power of making the world happy or at least of diminishing the unhappiness and making the world quite different. The worst kinds of unhappiness as well as the greatest amount of it come from our conduct toward one another. Basically the world is unkind. In such a world kindness goes a long way. As Shakespeare puts it “How far that little candle throws its beams/ So shines a good deed in a naughty world.” Can you imagine the lessening of world tension if all world leaders were kind?Can you reckon the peace of a household in which only kind words were spoken and every action was animated by kindness? What then is this kindness that can do so much to transform lives and environments? Kindness is an overflowing of ourselves upon others. We put others in our place and we treat them as we wish to be treated. In fact it is the daily earthly fulfillment of Jesus’ second commandment: to love your neighbor as yourself. It is divine in its origin. The overflow of self in God resulted in creation; creation is divine kindness. Kindness is coming to the rescue of others when they need it and we have thepower to supply what they need. The people had been with Jesus all day and they were hungry and the divine kindness multiplied loaves and fishes. She was a widow and alone and weeping as she followed the body of her only son to the cemetery and the divine kindness drew near and said “Young man I say to you arise” and he restored him to his mother. Kindness is coming to the rescue of others when they need it. Kindness is prodigal. It does the unnecessary and when it is done it looks like the most necessary thing that could have been done. If it soothes the sorrow it does more than that; if it relieves the want it does more than that; and the extra is the choicest thing in the bargain. If it must be economical when it gives it is never economical with the graciousness with which it gives. Kindness is a divine thing rather than a human one. In fact it springs from the very depths of our humanness–at that point at which we are closest to the image of the God in which we were created. Kindness makes life more endurable. The burdens of life often press very heavy so heavy that life approaches the unbearable. Our feet are blistered by the way we have traveled and every step of endurance is harshly painful. And then the kind word and the thoughtful action are like the woman who wipes the blood and sweat from the face of Jesus. It enables us to move on under our burden with a renewed heart. Kindness has converted more sinners than zeal eloquence or learning and these have never converted anyone unless they were kind as well. Almost all people have more goodness in them than has ever been discovered. In 60 or 70 years we can only give a sample of what we might be or of what we would be but at the touch of kindness generosity springs out of meanness. Like the words of Jesus “Lazarus come forth” kindness calls to life the goodness that had died. Kindness reveals a man to himself. Gently it arouses his self-respect and gives a person the courage once again to grow.***Kindness makes gloomy men smile and angry men grow meek. Sick men cease to groan. It lights hope in the eyes of the dying sweetness in the heart of the bitter turns men away from sin just when they are on the point of committing it. There are few gifts more precious than to lessen a person’s sins. We recall how Jesus passed along and saw Zaccheus up a tree and said kindly “Zaccheus come down I’m coming over to your house for dinner this day.” We know the tremendous change that took place in Zaccheus as a result of these small kind words of the Lord. Another work which kindness does is to encourage others in their efforts toward goodness. The habits of sin leave dirty footprints behind them and we grow tired of scrubbing the floor. There are few things which so resist the action of the Holy Spirit as discouragement losing heart. God’s grace seems to run off the discouraged like rain off the roof. Whether discouragement takes the form of peevishness or lethargy or delusion the mercy of God is needed to rouse it. All of us need encouragement. The path of virtueeven when it is not uphill is stony and hard and each day’s journey is a little longer than our strength admits of even though the day cannot be shortened. We may love God and love him truly yet we can’t help being aware that we are tired of the struggle to be holy. Because we are often busy with our own work and never look at that of others or because we are jealous and look coldly and critically at the work of others we have not come to rescue a brother or a sister about to stumble. Just a kindly tone of voice an understanding smile a loving glance of the eye–and this bit of human sunshine has renewed a drooping heart. That encouragement may be the first link of a new chain whichwhen finished is called final perseverance. I think at the judgment I shall more courageously face all my other sins than my lack of kindness.***Kindness is infectious. It is rare that an act of kindness stops with itself. By onekind action we commit ourselves to another. Moreover that kindness makes others kind in turn. It’s like the cottony seeds of the dandelion which a single breath of kindness blows in all directions. The kindest people are generally those who have received the greatest amount of kindness. All of us know that selfishness is a deeply rooted problem in our lives and it seems to resist a frontal attack. Yet our acts of kindness lay mines in its path and when it tries to advance it is badly wounded. Kindness seems to know some secret fountain of joy and opens it up to sending its waters dancing in our lives. An act of kindness makes our day lighten and like the sun breaking through in a heavy winter causes a certain amount of joy. People seem to grow kinder as they grow older. Perhaps we’ve all experienced that from our grandparents. Young people are not always kind. Kindness does not belong to the fervor of beginnings; it belongs to the solidity of growth. No one has ever sat under the kindly shade of a pumpkin which grows in six months but many have rested under the shade of a mature maple which offers refreshing coolness in the heat of the summer. Kindness is the key to humility that most difficult of all virtues. Kindness does so much for us; it helps us to unlearn our youthful habits of judgment and criticism. It makes us thoughtful and considerate. A kind person is one who’s never self-occupied. A kind person is gracious sympathetic of gentle humor noble and strong. Kindness is absolutely indispensable in winning others to our Lord.***Each of us in our thoughts is a world to himself. Perhaps our thoughts are a truer measure of ourselves even than our actions. Our thoughts are not under the control of human respect; it is not easy for our thoughts to be ashamed of themselves; they have no witness but God; they are not bound to keep within certain limits or observe certain proprieties. They are our own secret no one can make us blush because of our thoughts.  Our first thoughts often reveal to us faults of disposition which inner or outerrestraints will hinder from breaking into action. Our thoughts often tell us what in our inmost profound orientation we are like. Thoughts in themselves are nether good nor bad of course but they are a good indication of the sources of good and evil our lives. Thoughts are like a flashlight which enables us to see the gold ring we lost or the puddle of mud we are about to step into. If thoughts are of such importance and if kindness has all the effects that we have been talking about then kind thoughts must be of immense consequence. If a person has habitually kind thoughts about others that person is not far from being a saint. His first thoughts are kind and he does not repent of them and even when a sudden passion or a profound frustration has thrown a kind person into commotion he quickly settles down to a kindly humor. Kind thoughts are more rare than kind words or kind deeds. They implya great deal of thinking about others–thinking about others without criticism and that is indeed even more rare. One way to develop kind thoughts is to learn to practice kind thoughts and topraise others inwardly. This helps us to find others pleasant to be with and we ourselves become pleasant. Love follows the kind person and all the more since the kind person makes so few pretenses to be loved. The habit of not judging others is difficult to acquire and is generally the mark of a mature Christian. We all tend to set up our little judgment seats and everyone we know passes before those judgment seats in spite of the warning of our Lord “Judge not that you be not judged.” A frontal attack against judgmental thoughts is not the best strategy. If we ridourselves of uncharitable judgments we would have nothing left but a deep vacuum in our inner lives; it is much better to cultivate the habit of kind interpretations which will not only destroy the habit of negative judgments but will leave us with a positive acquisition. No one can judge human beings but God and God is so merciful because he is so wise. So we might conclude that kindness is the best wisdom because it is an image of the wisdom of God. We must esteem very lightly our sharp eye for evil which we pride ourselves on as much as our cleverness. We must look at our “talent for analysis of character” as the dreadful possibility of mountainous unkindness. We are sure to say clever things as long as we indulge in such analysis and clever things are sure to be sharp and acid. Doesn’t our own experience say that our kind interpretations have been truer than our harsh ones? Recall for a moment the mistakes made in judging others. Have they not always been on the side of harshness? Every day we experience that our righteous indignation has been aroused by some event and so we have formed a judgment in condemnation and all at once the matter is explained in some simple way so simple that we are surprised we didn’t think of the explanation. The habit of judging others blinds us so that we can only see the worst interpretation of another’s action. How many times have we been wrong when we put a kind interpretation on the actions of others? God’s action in others’ lives is a lot more common than our meanly measuring eyes allow for. We tend to interpret the actions of others as if they were our own. We are always capable of the sin we think others are capable of and even a well-founded suspicion more or less degrades us a person. Virtue grows in us under the influence of kindly thoughts just as viciousness develops into rash judgment. Often we find ourselves violently tempted to the sins we have been attributing to to others and the harsh thoughts are like seeds ready to sprout into evil. In a very real sense we are what we think and from our thoughts spring words. Our Lord said “From the abundance of the heart the mouthspeaks.” Recall for instance our Lord’s kindness his gentleness in the house of Simon the Pharisee.Then one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to a meal with him. When Jesus came into the house he took his place at the table and a woman known in the town as a bad woman found out that Jesus was there and brought an alabaster flask of perfume and stood behind him crying letting her tears fall on his feet and then drying them with her hair. And then she kissed them and anointed them with perfume.When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself If this man were really a prophet he would know who this woman is and what sort of person is touching him he would have realized that she is a bad woman.Then Jesus said to him “Simon there’s something I want to say to you.”“Very well Master” he returned “Say it.”“Once upon a time there were two men in debt to the same money lender and one owed him $50 and the other $5 and since they were unable to pay he generously canceled both of their debts. Now which of them do you suppose will love him more?”“Well” returned Simon “I suppose it would be the one who has been more generously treated.”“Exactly” replied Jesus. And then turning to the woman he said to Simon “Do you see this woman? I came into your house but you provided no water to wash my feet but she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. There was no warmth in your greeting but she from the moment I came in has not stopped covering my feet with her kisses. You gave me no oil for my head but she has put perfume on my feet. That is why I tell you Simon her sins many as they are are forgiven for she has shown me so much love. But the man who has little to be forgiven has only a little love to give.(Lk. 7:36-47)What a wonderful marvelous generous way of putting that woman at ease. Itcould only come from the wisdom and kindness of the heart of Jesus. From thoughts we naturally pass to words and if our thoughts are kind they tend to pass into kind words. Kind words are more powerful than logic will dissipate prejudice and set right things that have gone wrong. Most people get tired of even legitimate quarrels and kind words have a way of ending them. At first our kind words may be taken as an admission that we were wrong then they will be attributed to deceit and flattery then they will irritate by reason of the discomfort they cause to the conscience of the other and finally they will heal the wound that has been made. Most quarrels rest on misunderstandings and only live by silence. Kind words persisted in will not explain what has been misunderstood but they will make the explanation unnecessary. Kindness to be perfect or to be lasting has to be a conscious imitation of God.When the goodness and the loving kindness of God our Savior appeared he saved us by renewal in the Holy Spirit. Sharpness bitterness and sarcasm acute observation attributing motives–all these disappear when a person is earnest in surrendering to the power of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit who knows what is in us gives us the insight to make our kindness special tells us exactly what a person needs at a given moment. Kindness is not kindness unless it is special and in this its charm consists. Kind words cause happiness in others and they cause happiness in the speaker. Even to imagine kind words creates a warmth in our hearts and a gentleness in our disposition. As a matter of fact one of the best ways to overcome irritation is to think of and to plan kind words for another. They produce in us a quiet restfulness and they shed the peace of God abroad in our hearts. The kind word is never a mistake. Kindness is a little virtue so insignificant that it passes too often unnoticed and unpracticed. To be kind is to act from an unselfish motive; it catches us up into the regions of sacrifice. It is to spend oneself like God without hope of repayment or reward. The natural instinct of kind actions is to be hidden and so they are readily done for God alone. Kindness is not like the cedars of Lebanon; it’s like the grass of the fields and like the grass it feeds more sheep than the cedars of Lebanon. The unfailing practice of kindness is perhaps the simplest and the quickest way of having the mind and heart of Christ. Editor’s note: This article likely originated from a pastoral talk by Fr.

7202,March 31 2020 4:06 p.m.,Alleluia He is Coming,How to record your audio for community-wide Easter virtual choir    Before you start you will need:1. A smart phone tablet or computer with headphones for listening to the demo. You’ll use this to watch or listen to the demo video while you sing along and record yourself. Singing along with the demo will keep everyone singing at the same pace allowing us to combine the recordings. The headphones will make sure that the sound of the demo does not come through in your recording.2. A second smartphone tablet computer or audio recorder to record your voice(s). Choose something you can place close to your mouth so that it picks up just your voice and not so much other room noise.On an iPhone you can use the “Voice Memo” app to make the recording. On an Android smartphone use the voice recording app of your choice. (You may already have one on your phone or you can download one from the Google Play store).3. Quiet: A relatively quiet space in which to record. If possible turn off loud AC units or fans in the room. Just do your best to minimize other noises warring with your singing.4. Music: The sheet music for “Alleluia He is Coming” if you don’t know it by heart. It’s #5 in the green Sing Out Your Praise songbooks or you can print off the PDF here.If you are recording a large family or household together:1. Use a few smartphones or other audio recorders with several people clumped around each of them.--If you use multiple recorders you don’t need to sync the files together; just send them all in as described below.2. Have one person listen to the demo recording while you all sing together. That person will need to count off and cue the rest of the group when to start. The rest of the group can watch the leader or watch the video on the song leader’s screen for a visual cue of when to start and stop. You might try practicing with the demo video first so that everyone gets used to the correct timing. It might be messy and that’s okay--we’re not trying to sound like a professional choir. You can always try multiple takes too. When you record:1. Begin by praying and singing the song prayerfully as practice and to set the right tone.2. Position your audio recording  device so that the microphone is a few inches below your chin (or equidistant from the singers in your group). Most smart phones have their microphone on the bottom of the phone so hold the phone upside down and point it below your chin (this will protect the microphone from loud breath noise). Have your headphones ready but leave them unplugged. Start playing the demo video.3. Press record on your audio device.4. When prompted in the demo video state the full name of all the video participants or just the family/household name and your branch.5. Wait for Elizabeth to clap in the demo so that your audio recorder microphone picks up that sound and then plug in your headphones so that only you can hear the demo.6. Sing along with Elizabeth: one chorus the fourth verse and then two choruses in a row. Stay on the melody in the first chorus; then in the fourth verse and second two choruses you can add harmonies if you wish. (But you don’t have to harmonize).7. When the song is finished don’t just stop! Feel free to keep on praising the Lord vocally just as we usually do when we pray together. Raise a shout even! In fact you can do this during the fourth verse and final chorus too. Wait until Elizabeth tells you to stop recording then stop. Now you’ve got your audio contribution ready to send.A tip for groups: If you’re recording with a group where only one of you can hear the original demo track you can expect it will be easy to get off track from the music in the demo. If you get off track just let the demo keep playing and jump back in when you are ready to come back in together. If you can get through one chorus all together relatively in time with the demo track that’s a big success.To send in your photo: Take a photo of yourself or your household either before or after you record the song. If you have a recent photo of yourself or the group that can work too.--To send a photo on your phone open up the camera app select your photo press the share button and select the option to share it via your email app of choice. Send the photo to [email protected] with subject line “Alleluia_[Your Name]_[Your Branch]”--To send a photo from your computer open up your email and attach the photo to the email. Send the photo to [email protected] with subject line “Alleluia_[Your Name]_[Your Branch]”To send in your audio: --If you recorded audio on your phone or tablet you can send your recording directly from there. Open up the app you used to record yourself select your recording press the share button and select the option to share it via your email app of choice. Send the recording to [email protected] with subject line “Alleluia_[Your Name]_[Your Branch]”.--If you recorded on a computer you can open up your email and attach the audio file from the place you saved it. Send the file to [email protected] with subject line “Alleluia_[Your Name]_[Your Branch]”.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7202

Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode by Sean Connolly Last summer my nine-year-old daughter and I took a road trip from South Bend to Dodge City Kansas. Along the way we listened to a biography of Harriet Tubman the heroine of the underground railroad.  Long before Harriet was stealing away at night with various relatives and friends she came to understand the threat of family separation. In the dramatized version we listened to Harriet’s mother Rit explained things to her six-year-old daughter. “Harriet now that you’re worth money you got to walk a fine line. If you’re too stubborn to work for hire you’ll be sold south like the others and we’ll never see you again.”  Rit knew the threat was real. Three of Harriet’s eight siblings were sold off as children—gone forever. Rit saved a fourth child by threatening to split the seller’s head open. Hearing this story gave me the grace to see something new in an old spiritual “He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands.” All of a sudden the song changed for me. No longer was it a trite ubiquitous children’s song but something exceedingly deep a psalm a sung act of faith that helps me even now when death is on the loose threatening families.  God is the one who holds everything and everyone together as the song declares. The mothers and the fathers the brothers and the sisters the little bitty babies all of them. Because He’s got the whole world in His hands family ties are real even when the family is violently sundered. Brothers and sisters by blood—and brothers and sisters by water—are all kept close for as the apostle Paul put it “in Him all things hold together” (Col. 1:17). God held Harriet and her family together and He is holding us together now. Today we are sharing some different recordings of “He’s Got the Whole World”—from the great Marian Anderson’s concert version to another by our own Jim Rolland (Servant Branch). One of my favorite performances comes from Joe Carter a singer of African American spirituals who died of leukemia in 2006. Mr. Carter wrote “When I sing this song I remember it was slave mothers who probably sang this to their babies to tell them to have courage because God was with them.”  You can also listen to these on our YouTube playlist which includes all the performances except Joe Carter’s. You can find his performance here on Soundcloud.   Marian Anderson:    Joe Carter:    Jim Rolland:    Clara Ward:    Jessye Norman & Kathleen Battle:    Dolly Parton & Kenny Rogers:    Odetta:    Mahalia Jackson:,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7152
7136,March 26 2020 4:03 p.m.,Banging on God's Door,"Rus Lyons didn’t get much sleep last Wednesday night. As manager of Custom Cottage Furniture shop on the South Side of Indianapolis he’s responsible for the success of the business but he didn’t have any furniture to build. “We make custom furniture and January and February are our slow season” says Rus. “Sales had picked up as usual the first week of March but then the COVID-19 crisis caused orders for new furniture to dry right up just when we were expecting our seasonal recovery period.” Earlier that day the workers had finished all their orders. No new orders were on his desk. So hard decisions would have to be made. Rus came to the uneasy conclusion that he would have to lay off all three workers starting with his two furniture builders. On Thursday morning Rus delayed entering the shop long enough to take an anxious walk around the block preparing himself to tell his employees there was no more work. Then the phone rang. “A customer called to say he wanted a pair of loft beds we'd been talking about. I assigned one to each builder but then I discovered we didn’t have enough of that particular wood in stock to finish the job. I got on the phone. A local kiln had some but they couldn't have it ready for four hours.”  Rus placed the order and started helping the finisher on another project. To his delight he received a call only 30 minutes later: the wood was ready.   “So I headed out to my truck only to find out that somebody had stolen my tailgate right off the back of it! Laughing I didn't even care I had orders!  “On the way one of my tires blew. I called someone to bring me the spare—it was at the shop—but no sooner had I hung up than a downpour started and it rained the whole rest of the day. Even so it was so clear God was working in spite of all this it didn't matter.” Rus finally picked up the wood and brought it back to the shop. He received two more orders that day.  Since then he’s had five more orders. “Right now we're  booked till next Thursday but we've got a lot of promising bids out there.""  “Banging on God’s door I could tell he was hearing me but he didn't answer until I was ready to close the shop down. Please keep praying for more orders—he hears us!”   Visit The Custom Cottage on their website or check them out on Facebook or Instagram.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7136
7112,March 25 2020 3:50 p.m.,Appleton Holds Viritual Branch Meeting,Appleton Holds Zoom Branch Meeting  Vi Ruth and Michael Schmelzer open the Lords Day with other branch members over Zoom. The Appleton branch held their first community meeting using the Zoom video conferencing service last weekend. Eight couples and three singles prayed together and encouraged one another for an hour last Sunday afternoon.  The week before several branch members had experimented with a joint Lord's Day Opening ceremony using Zoom and Michael Schmelzer had recently hosted a men's group on Zoom to accommodate three members who were spread all over Florida. The inaugural virtual branch meeting was a learning experience. Due to time lags between locations singing together proved difficult. Amidst their laughter they decided that everyone besides the song leaders would mute themselves. They also had to learn not to talk over one another.  “Everyone had a positive attitude—it was awesome!” said Ruth Schmelzer. “It was good to see people's faces.”  They spent time praising God praying for intentions updating one another on personal news and talking about how to reach out to branch members who don't have access to computers or the internet.  The Appleton branch holds a virtual community meeting. “It was a wonderful time of technological fellowship” said Patti Lee who along with her husband David joined the meeting from their home in Florida. The Lees enjoyed the experience so much that they hosted a gathering on Zoom with their six children and their families. Branch leader Steve Pable said about 40 percent of the branch was able to join the online meeting. “It proved to be a success and we plan on trying it again soon.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7112

They’d stepped onto the grass after walking down a path and seeing people coming towards them from both directions.  With the spread of coronavirus Genevieve was trying to maintain a six foot distance between her family members and any strangers. At the moment she didn’t see where they could go--the nature area usually quiet and peaceful was swarming with people. Schools had closed down and besides that the azaleas were in full bloom attracting onlookers.  Azaleas blooming at the Norton Art Gallery in Shreveport. Photo by Brigette Mysliwiec. “Let’s pray in tongues” she told her kids. They paused for a few moments to pray then Genevieve looked up. In the distance darting from one clump of azaleas to another she saw an orange fox. She pointed at it and her children took off running with Genevieve running too. Soon they were away from the crowds. “I realized that we had just prayed for the Holy Spirit to bless us” Genevieve said “and God had showed us a fox. I experienced the Lord being with us wanting to bring us delight and joy in nature.”  The Barretts have gone to the gardens several times a week for years but they had only seen a fox once before.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7098

6966,March 16 2020 2:13 p.m.,Seeing the Invisible,Photo Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures. © 2019 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation All Rights Reserved A Hidden Life: Two Perspectives Introduction by Sean Connolly Since 2016 Joe Gleason (South Bend) has been on assignment from the community to work as an editor for the film director Terrence Malick. (Malick’s 2011 masterpiece The Tree of Life was recently named the number one film of the decade by the Associated Press.) The film Joe worked on has been playing in theaters since December. It’s called A Hidden Life. A Hidden Life tells the story of Franz Jägerstätter an Austrian farmer and devout Christian who was executed by the Nazis in 1943. The title of the film comes from the 19th-century novel Middlemarch by George Eliot “for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life and rest in unvisited tombs.” Writing in The Wall Street Journal critic John Anderson said “With A Hidden Life and the story of Franz Jägerstätter the director [Malick] has found the ideal vehicle for his cosmic inquiries and has created a film that is mournful memorable and emotionally exhilarating.” He added “The editing by Rehman Nizar Ali Joe Gleason and Sebastian Jones is superb.” In a note to community members Joe wrote “I cannot adequately express my gratitude for the gift of this amazing community. I may be temporarily in a different city but my heart is and always will be with the People of Praise. Thank you for your prayers love and support as I’ve worked on this once-in-a-lifetime project.” In this issue of V&B we are delighted to publish two essays about A Hidden Life written by community members Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) and Elizabeth Pease (Servant Branch). Elizabeth Pease's piece is presented below. You can find Andrew Zwerneman's piece here.  Photo by Reiner Bajo. © 2019 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved. Seeing the Invisible by Elizabeth Pease Franz Jägerstätter was a man whose motivation came from the constant conversation he had with an invisible and inaudible friend—the God he chose to follow to the cross. Drafted to serve in the Nazi army during World War II Jägerstätter refused to take the required oath of loyalty to Hitler and was guillotined for it leaving behind his wife Franziska (Fani) and three small daughters. On the surface this outwardly clearcut plot (the brutal ending is never in doubt) accompanied by a complex inner struggle seems an unlikely fit for the visual medium of film. But in Terrence Malick’s A Hidden Life a combination of effects—scenes of rural beauty snatches of real letters between Franz and Fani crescendos of music and the oppressive drones of Nazi planes—forms a symphony that helps those of us on the outside see and understand what’s happening within. Malick’s latest film shows us the hidden life of a Christian couple two ordinary people deciding with God how to respond to the good and evil of their time. Since his 1978 Days of Heaven Malick has become famous for exactly this—letting us in on the inner landscape of his characters. We hear their fragmented thoughts and bits of what others have said to them in voice-over. Repeated images or phrases of music become symbolic triggers associated with a particular emotion or idea like the way a certain smell can put us immediately back in a memory. A Hidden Life opens by introducing some of the notes that will be used to create the symphony. There’s a voice-over from Franz “I thought we could build our nest high up . . . fly away like birds to the mountains . . .” His voice is interrupted by Nazi propaganda footage—a plane Hitler waving to adoring crowds a giant bonfire. Then we see the Jägerstätters at work on their farm and the Austrian mountains bathed in sunlight. There’s the sound of wind and there’s running water: a waterfall a river. These are the symbols of the heavenly nest birds fly away to. Another early sequence provides our first introduction to the voice calling Franz. With the camera inside a dark doorway looking out to the sunlit mountainside Franz enters the town’s small church and pulls the bell rope. He walks alone to the edge of a field where the forest begins. There’s a soft swell of music. The camera sweeps away from Franz and upward to the treeline to the sky and sunlight. Franz looks sharply over his shoulder and we wonder who’s there? What has he heard? On the mountainside a blindfolded and smiling Franz stumbles after Fani and the girls who creep silently around him hitting metal jugs with spoons. He knows they’re present if just out of reach. Later Franz stands in the light outside a dark doorway and walks away from it. Storm clouds gather over the mountains. Hearing thunder Franz looks up from his work in the field and over his shoulder into the distance. A moment later he paces in the sunlit vestibule of the church. This time Franz acts on his experience with that voice—he’s made a decision. He walks with his parish priest on the road outside and voices the fateful words for the first time “Father if I’m called up I can’t serve.” Doorways from darkness to light loom over Franz’s decision. He stands inside doorways peering out to the light. Looking out the doorway of a sawmill to a bright orchard he and Fani discuss his choice. A neighbor asks “What are you going to do?” over a shot of the dark doorway looking out to sun-drenched cows outside. The cross Franz is choosing comes into stark focus as he approaches his church one day. On the way he pauses to gaze at a crucifix beside the road. Inside the church Franz listens to a painter who bemoans the sentimentality of his murals. “I paint their comfortable Christ with a halo on his head. . . .” At the word “halo” there’s a shot over Franz’s shoulder with the dappled light through the leaves playing on his cheek. Malick is linking Franz to the halo and by extension the cross. “Someday” says the painter “I’ll paint the true Christ.” Fani is the first one to notice a change in Franz. “These last weeks you’re different” she says. It hurts Franz to see Fani endure the slights of their neighbors who spit on her in the town and throw mud at her children. Her opinion is vital to him and we see her react to his dilemma more than once hoping for some other outcome. Again he’s looking out a doorway and next to him she looks out too and asks “When have our prayers not been answered?” She questions him in the orchard “You could work in a hospital. There’s nothing wrong with that is there?” But while Franz stands in a doorway to light Fani is repeatedly shot in the dark against the inside wall of the barn without a doorway—only chinks of light coming in through the slats. Images give us the presence of evil too harkening back to the bonfire in the black and white Nazi footage. Early on we see Fani at a bonfire with drifting smoke. Then later the mayor moves frenetically around a bonfire gesturing to gathered men in Nazi uniforms. Franz tells Fani of his dream about a train hurtling forwards to some unknown destination and as he goes from home to the army to prisons on trains we see the coal fires that burn at the heart of the locomotives.  Photo by Reiner Bajo. © 2019 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved. The conversation between Franz Fani and God crystallizes in a dark moment in the Berlin prison. We see Franz brutally beaten by the prison guards while we hear him praying in voice-over. He’s riffing on Psalm 23: “You my shepherd . . . You make me lie down in green pastures . . . by the river of life.”) The camera floats down the dark prison hallway looking in at each man in his cell lit from the barred windows. This point-of-view shot can’t belong to Franz who is cornered by the guards in his cell. Another blow. “You our light . . . ” he prays again from the Psalms “Darkness is not dark to you.” The music swells and the camera rushes down the hallway and up the stairs to the light streaming in from a window on the prison’s top floor. In that same moment Fani is also praying. We see her kneeling in the barn where she’s positioned blocking the light from the doorway. She pleads “Lord you do nothing. Where are you?” As if in answer a shot of flies swarming in Franz’s cell cuts to Franz and Fani at the edge of a ripe wheat field with their daughters in the mountains. When Fani learns that Franz has been condemned to death she rushes to Berlin to see him. There are few cuts away to images in this scene and the music is an Agnus Dei. It’s Franz’s last chance to change his mind sign the paper and swear loyalty to Hitler. Disregarding the arguments of the attorney and the priest who start the scene standing in front of the small room’s two windows as though blocking the light Franz looks into Fani’s eyes and asks her “Do you understand?” Her answer isn’t yes but it is vibrant in its power. “I love you. Whatever you do whatever comes I’m with you always.” In A Hidden Life Franz speaks rarely and shows only subtle emotion on his face. Still his character is anything but flat because we’ve seen the motions of his interior life. He will give up his beloved mountains and wind the aching beauty of flowing water and sunlight and even his wife and daughters not to sign that evil oath and to follow the Christ he’s heard and looked for over his shoulder. Fani’s sacrifice of love means everything because we’ve heard the cries to God she hasn’t shared with Franz and seen the obstacles she’s overcome to say those words. In Malick’s swooping camera to the sky there’s a third character in this marriage the God whose voice calls Franz. To echo the painter—in A Hidden Life Malick has painted a true Christ.

Andrew Zwerneman's piece is presented below. You can find Elizabeth Pease's piece here.  Photo by Reiner Bajo. © 2019 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved. Speech and Conscience in A Hidden Life by Andrew J. Zwerneman “Sprechen Verboten” (Speaking is forbidden). Stenciled on the interior wall of a Nazi prison yard these two words loom over Franz Jägerstätter the protagonist of Terrence Malick’s latest film A Hidden Life. They are part of the crucible employed by the regime to bend this one seemingly insignificant Austrian conscript to its will. A prohibition on speech is a terrible experience for any man because it undercuts his freedom and responsibility. This is true of its counterpart as well which demands that one speak against one’s conscience. The weight of the oppression grows heavier when a man is isolated from those who would inform his conscience. Everyone needs to speak in true freedom; every conscience needs to hear from faithful companions. Genuine speech is neither violent nor servile; it is expressed as understanding memory and love. Nazi ideology stood in sharp contrast to what is true about our humanity so it is no surprise that Hitler’s Reich imposed great suffering on anyone who for reasons of conscience refused to speak what was commanded. Still how does one film the work of the conscience hidden as it is? How does one capture the internal struggle to speak when confronted by the demand for conformity? Malick successfully recreates this struggle for us and while his story focuses primarily on the struggle of one historical individual the experiences Malick captures on film deepen our understanding of and sympathy for the precarious condition we all share. Franz and his wife Fani live in the remote Tyrolian village of St. Radegund. Early in the film their existence is Edenic. At the village’s edge bells toll from the tiny church where Franz serves as sexton. The villagers live in neat wooden cottages crafted seamlessly into the ancient ascending mountainscape. Most of the film’s dialogue is spoken in English but the villagers greet one another with “Grüss Gott” (God bless you). Life here is verdant and without want their land and abundance shared in peaceful harmony as if the mountains have raised St. Radegund beyond the veil that separates heaven and earth. As Fani says in a voice-over “We lived above the clouds.” Still St. Radegund is not quite beyond the world’s reach. In the opening minutes of the film Malick weaves in black and white footage of a Nuremberg rally. (The footage is from Leni Riefenstahl’s 1935 Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will.) The Nazi faithful parade from the central market square’s Frauenkirch  (Church of Our Lady) to the rally grounds  at the city’s edge. Hitler plays the messiah descending by plane from the clouds above then processing down the wide stadium stairs with his acolytes flanking him in liturgical formation. He is the high priest in a massive concrete temple. His congregation is vast and overwhelming; column upon column of brownshirts and stormtroopers assemble beneath Roman standards and banners marked with the twisted cross. The orchestrated ritual heralds the instantiation of Hitler’s millennarian vision. There is nothing hidden: These forces rallied and sharply arranged are poised to execute their savage mission across Germany and beyond its borders. Malick juxtaposes the Nuremberg scene with one in which the camera pans across the majestic mountains surrounding St. Radegund. We hear the mechanical grind of a plane engine invading the clouds and Hitler’s percussive voice cracking across the high valleys. Each signals a new form of speech for Franz the hidden man and for St. Radegund the hidden village. Neither can avoid the Third Reich’s arrival; each must respond. Malick has set his stage.  Photo by Reiner Bajo. © 2019 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved. Surprisingly it takes little time for the peace that once graced the village to collapse. At the center are two emerging opponents. There is Franz who as a conscript in the Wehrmacht contemplates a refusal to take the oath to Hitler. On the opposing side are the villagers who wholeheartedly embrace the Anschluss. Home for now and in between training sessions with the army Franz knows that his next time in uniform will bring the dreaded ceremony. His disinclination to embrace the Nazi culture now gathering steam in St. Radegund evokes contempt among his neighbors. The hostility deepens with the growing recognition that Franz will likely not take the oath. The hotheads goad him; the mayor shames and reviles him. How quickly they have forgotten the manners of grace; how little their hearts stir now at church bells and mountain peaks. What is yet more compelling is Franz’s struggle to speak his mind regarding his decision and to hear some kindred voice. The parish priest counsels him to take the oath: Consider the “consequences” he warns. Even his bishop in Linz is clearly afraid for himself if he were to encourage Franz in any way that opposes the Reich. The few villagers sympathetic to Franz offer no significant help to their friend caught as they are between worry and despair. Fani remains true to her husband from beginning to end and their love for each other proves a great source of freedom for Franz but there is no doubt that her ability to understand him is limited. All this means that the demands on Franz’s conscience increasingly isolate him. Franz we learn objects to the killing of innocents in the Nazi invasions which he witnesses in a black and white newsreel. It is a factor that weighs on him; he cannot ignore that knowledge if he is to be true to his conscience. At the same time there is the seeming emptiness of his refusal to take the oath. Once he finally refuses and begins his journey through prison to trial Franz is repeatedly counseled that his choice will make no impact on the Reichor on the outcome of the war. He is counseled in other ways too with weapons of persuasion: beatings isolation from his family and the prohibition on speech in the prison yard. For his part Franz judges no one for taking the oath and makes no denunciation of his captors. Outside of St. Radegund and the narrow corridors of the military penal system no one even knows of his plight. As he is driven from prison to courtroom through the streets of Berlin he passes unnoticed. The accumulated effect of these facts is that his refusal appears to have no significant weight outside of the consequences it bears for his life and his family. For all of the heavenly mountainous imagery captured for our viewing there is no clarion sound from above no audible voice we can say is God’s. Still there is a moment where it strikes us that Franz hears a calling: While waiting to return to the army he is walking by the woods near St. Radegund and something in the depth of the trees seems to hold him. The camera angle at this juncture is not as it might well be in a Malick film ascending upwards to the treetops. Franz is not gazing heavenward; rather the angle is on his profile facing the woods seeking out or responding to something hidden from us but clearly sensed by Franz. He is focused but agitated. The moment is a definitive crossroads: He can act on what he hears in his conscience hidden like the voice in the woods or he can leave the woods behind in order to avoid the measurable consequences in store if he refuses to take the oath. Throughout A Hidden Life with the exception of “Grüss Gott” and some sweet exchanges between Franz and Fani German is the language of coarseness anger and violence. Hitler incites the crowd. The village mayor spews a crazed extended rant. Sadistic prison guards spit their vulgarities in Franz’s face. A tribunal officer rages at him. All of this is spoken in German. Late in the film at a moment when Franz sits alone we hear another voiceover. The camera zooms in on his haggard face. We don’t see him say anything; we just hear him. Softly he speaks “Vater unser im Himmel . . . ” (Our Father in heaven). It is the Lord’s Prayer. The coarse violent German repeatedly thrust at Franz finally gives way to the tender cry of a suffering son for his father. Speech is redeemed by a prayer ancient but called to memory in the freedom found only when a man has nothing left but God.

6980,March 16 2020 12:19 p.m.,How to Evangelize: An Interview with Pope Francis,Photo courtesy of Catholic Church (England and Wales) License: CCBY-NC-SA2.0. Editor’s Note: In these excerpts from a book-length interview conducted by Italian journalist Gianni Valenti Pope Francis speaks pithily about his approach to mission work. He speaks about the role of the Holy Spirit the importance of “attraction” and the dangers of “taming Christ” by taking a programmatic or managerial approach to evangelization. “To evangelize” Pope Francis says “means delivering Christ’s own testimony in simple and precise words like the Apostles did.” We publish his comments here because they speak to issues of importance to all Christians. Holy Father you said that as a young man you wanted to go to Japan as a missionary. Can we say then that the Pope never became a missionary? I don’t know. I joined the Jesuits because I was struck by their missionary vocation—of always going to the frontiers. At the time I could not go to Japan. But I have always felt that to proclaim Jesus and his gospel always involves a certain outgoingness and being on the move. You always repeat: “A church that is on the move.” Many have picked up this expression and sometimes it seems to have become a hackneyed slogan used by a growing number of people who spend their time lecturing the church on what she should or should not be. “A church on the move” is not a fashionable expression that I invented. It is Jesus’ command who in the Gospel of Mark asks his followers to go into the whole world and preach the gospel “to every creature.” The church is either on the move or she is not church. Either she evangelizes or she is not church. If the church is not on the move she decays she becomes something else. What does a church that does not evangelize and is not in movement become? It becomes a spiritual association a multinational that launches ethical and religious initiatives and messages. There is nothing wrong with that but that is not the church. This is the risk of any static organization in the church. We end up taming Christ. You no longer bear witness to what Christ does but speak on behalf of a certain idea of Christ an idea that you have appropriated and domesticated. You organize things you become the little manager of ecclesial life where everything happens according to an established plan to be followed only according to instruction. But the encounter with Christ never happens. The encounter that touched your heart at the beginning doesn’t happen anymore. Is mission itself an antidote to all this? Is the will and effort to “go out” on mission enough to avoid these distortions? The mission the “church on the move” is not a program an intention to be carried out by sheer force of will. It is Christ who makes the church go out of herself. In the mission of evangelization you move because the Holy Spirit pushes you and brings you. And when you get there you realize that he is already there and is waiting for you. The Spirit of the Lord arrived first. He has already prepared the path for you and is already at work. In a meeting with the Pontifical Missionary Societies you suggested that they read the Acts of the Apostles as a habitual text to pray over. The protagonist of the Acts of the Apostles is not the Apostles. The protagonist is the Holy Spirit. The Apostles are the first to recognize him and testify to him. When they communicate the decisions established by the Council of Jerusalem to the community in Antioch they write: “We have decided the Holy Spirit and us.” They realistically acknowledge that it was the Lord who daily added to their number “those who were saved” rather than the persuasive efforts of men. And is it the same today as it was back then? Has nothing changed? The experience of the Apostles is like a paradigm that is always valid. Just think of how things happen spontaneously in the Acts of the Apostles without coercion. It is a human story in which the disciples always arrive afterwards they always arrive after the Holy Spirit has already acted. He prepares and works on hearts. He upsets their plans. It is he who accompanies them guides them and comforts them in all the circumstances they find themselves living. When problems and persecutions come the Holy Spirit works there too in an even more surprising way with his comfort his consolations as happens after the first martyrdom that of Saint Stephen. What happens next? A time of persecution begins and many disciples flee Jerusalem going to Judea and Samaria. And there while they are dispersed and fugitives they begin to evangelize though they are alone and without the Apostles who remained in Jerusalem. They are baptized and the Holy Spirit gives them apostolic courage. There we see for the first time that baptism is enough to become evangelizers. That’s what mission is. Mission is his work. There’s no point in getting agitated. There’s no need for us to get organized no need to scream no need for gimmicks or stratagems. All we need to do is ask to be able to repeat the experience today that makes us say “We have decided the Holy Spirit and us.” And without this experience what do the calls for missionary mobilization mean? Without the Spirit wanting to do mission becomes something else. It becomes I would say a plan to conquer the pretext that we are conquering something. A religious or perhaps an ideological conquest perhaps carried out even with good intentions. But it’s another thing. Quoting Pope Benedict XVI you often repeat that the church grows by “attraction.” What do you mean? Who attracts? Who is attracted? Jesus says it in the Gospel of John “When I am lifted up from the earth I will draw everyone to myself.” And in the same Gospel he also says: “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him.” The church has always recognized that this is the proper form of every movement that brings us closer to Jesus and the gospel. It is not a conviction a rationalization it’s not taking a position; not a pressure or a constraint. It is always an attraction. The Prophet Jeremiah already said “You duped me O Lord and I let myself be duped.” And this applies to the Apostles to the missionaries and to their work. How does what you have just described take place? The Lord’s mandate to go out and evangelize comes from within by falling in love by loving attraction. One does not follow Christ and even less become an evangelizer because of a decision made sitting around a table or by one’s own activism. Even missionary thrust can be fruitful only if it takes place within this attraction and transmits it to others. What is the meaning of these words with respect to the mission and the proclamation of the gospel? It means that if you have been attracted by Christ if you move and do things because you are attracted by Christ others will notice it without effort. There is no need to prove it let alone flaunt it. Instead anyone who thinks he or she is the protagonist or manager of the mission with all the best intentions and declarations of purpose often ends up attracting no one. In the apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel) you recognize that all this can give us a certain vertigo. It is like those who dive into the ocean not knowing what to expect. What did you want to suggest with this image? Do these words also concern mission? Mission is not a tried and tested company plan. Neither is it a public spectacle organized to flaunt how many people are associated with it thanks to our marketing. The Holy Spirit works as he wills when he wills and where he wills. And this can cause a certain vertigo. Yet the high point of freedom rests precisely in this letting oneself be carried by the Spirit renouncing the need to calculate and control everything. This is precisely how we imitate Christ himself who in the mystery of his resurrection learned to rest in the tenderness of the Father’s embrace. Mission’s mysterious fruitfulness does not consist in our intentions in our methods in our impulses and in our initiatives but rests precisely in this vertigo: the vertigo we perceive when we hear Jesus’ words: “without me you can do nothing.” You also often repeat that the church grows “by witnessing.” What are you trying to suggest by insisting on this? The fact that attraction makes us witnesses. This witness testifies to what the work of Christ and his Spirit have really accomplished in our life. After his resurrection it is Christ himself who reveals himself to the Apostles. It is he who makes them witnesses. In addition this witness is not self-serving. We are witnesses to the Lord’s works. Something else you repeat often in this case in a negative sense: the church does not grow through proselytizing and the mission of the church is not proselytism. Why do you insist on this so much? Is it to maintain good relations with other churches and dialogue with other religious traditions? The problem with proselytism is not only the fact that it contradicts the ecumenical journey and interreligious dialogue. There is proselytism wherever there is the idea of making the church grow by putting less emphasis on this attraction on the part of Christ and the work of the Spirit focusing everything on any type of “wise discourse.” Therefore proselytism first of all cuts out Christ himself and the Holy Spirit from the mission even when we claim to speak and act nominally in Christ’s name. Proselytism is always violent by nature even when it is hidden or exercised with white gloves. It does not tolerate the freedom and graciousness with which faith can be transmitted from person to person by grace. This is why proselytism is not only something of the past of bygone colonialist times or conversions forced or bought with the promise of material advantages. Proselytism can also exist today even in parishes communities movements religious congregations. So what does it mean to evangelize? To evangelize means delivering Christ’s own testimony in simple and precise words like the Apostles did. But there is no need to invent persuasive discourses. The proclamation of the gospel can even be whispered but it always passes through the overwhelming power of the scandal of the cross. And it has always followed the path indicated in the letter of the Apostle Peter which consists in simply “providing reasons” of one’s hope to others a hope that remains a scandal and foolishness in the eyes of the world. How do we recognize a Christian missionary? A distinctive feature is that of acting as facilitators and not as controllers of the faith. Facilitating making easy without us placing obstacles to Jesus’ desire to embrace everyone to heal everyone to save everyone not being selective not imposing “pastoral tariffs” not playing the part of the guard at the door controlling who has the right to enter. I remember parish priests and communities in Buenos Aires who set up many initiatives to facilitate access to baptism. In the last few years they realized the number was growing of those not being baptized for various reasons even sociological ones and they wanted to remind everyone that being baptized is something simple that everyone can request it for themselves and for their children. The path taken by those parish priests and those communities had one objective: not to add burdens not to make claims to remove any cultural psychological or practical difficulties that could push people to postpone or drop the intention to baptize their own children. Some tend to drive a wedge between the transparent proclamation of the faith and social work. They say that we must not reduce mission to a type of social activity. Is that a legitimate concern? Everything that is within the scope of the Beatitudes and the works of mercy is in agreement with mission is already proclamation is already mission. The church is not an NGO the church is something else. But the church is also a field hospital where everyone is welcome as they are where everyone’s wounds are healed. And this is part of her mission. Everything depends on the love that moves the heart of those who do things. If a missionary helps dig a well in Mozambique because he is aware that those he baptizes and evangelizes need it how can it be said that that work is separate from evangelization? Today what are the new focusses and sensitivities to put into practice in the processes aimed at making evangelization fruitful in the various social and cultural contexts? Christianity does not embrace only one cultural model. As John Paul II acknowledged “While remaining completely true to itself with unswerving fidelity to the proclamation of the gospel and the tradition of the church Christianity will also reflect the different faces of the cultures and peoples in which it is received and takes root.” The Holy Spirit embellishes the church with the new languages of persons and communities that embrace the gospel. Thus the church taking up the values of different cultures becomes “sponsa ornate monilibus suis” “the bride bedecked with her jewels” of which the Prophet Isaiah speaks. It is true that some cultures have been closely linked to the preaching of the gospel and to the development of Christian thought. But in the period we are living it becomes even more urgent to bear in mind that the revealed message is not identified with a particular culture. And when meeting new cultures or cultures that have not accepted the Christian proclamation we must not try to impose a determined cultural form together with the evangelical proposition. Today in missionary work as well it is even more important not to carry heavy baggage. Mission and martyrdom. You have often recalled the intimate bond uniting these two realities. In Christian life the realities of martyrdom and evangelization both have the same origin the same source: when the love of God poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit gives strength courage and consolation. Martyrdom is the maximum expression of the recognition of and the testimony rendered to Christ which represents the fulfillment of mission of apostolic work. I always think of the Coptic brothers slaughtered in Libya who quietly uttered Jesus’ name while they were being beheaded. I think of Saint Mother Teresa’s sisters murdered in Yemen while they were taking care of Muslim patients in a home for disabled elderly people. The sisters were wearing work aprons over their religious habits when they were killed. They are all victors not victims. And their martyrdom to the point of the shedding of blood illuminates the martyrdom that everyone can suffer in everyday life with the witness rendered to Christ every day. It’s what can be observed when visiting old missionaries in their nursing homes. They are often battered by the life they have had. A missionary told me that many of them lose their memories and no longer remember anything about the good they did. “But it does not matter” he told me “because the Lord remembers it very well.” (GV) (Agenzia Fides 4/11/2019) Credit: The Pope and Mission: “Without Jesus We Can Do Nothing” by Gianni Valenti with Fides News Agency is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en.

6972,March 16 2020 12:18 p.m.,Binging Jesus: Will a Crowd-Funded TV Show Spark the Next Great Revival?,Simon Peter (Shahar Isaac) and Andrew (Noah James) on the Sea of Galilee in The Chosen. Photo courtesy of VidAngel Studios. by Sean Connolly “Join me in spreading the news; together let’s get the word out” (Psalm 34:3 MSG). Mike Wacker (Servant Branch) estimated he’s told 45 people about it. A sister here in my branch (South Bend) said eight people told her about it in a week arousing her curiosity and her skepticism. I tested it out on my kids who begged for more of it. The Evansville missionaries are sharing it with their neighbors. One neighbor a woman who struggles with drug addiction reported that it helped her have her first-ever personal encounter with Jesus. Nancy Grams (Servant Branch) after witnessing amazing health improvements in her husband Louis (see their story here) remarked that she feels like she’s living right in the middle of it. So what is it? A new TV series called The Chosen. A show that tells the old old story in a fresh way where Jesus is a minor character and the Gospels’ minor characters are the stars. The characters speak with Middle Eastern accents in an accessible idiomatic English. “Get used to different” Jesus declares to his disciples. Watching The Chosen is like watching the unfolding of someone else’s Ignatian meditation someone skilled at intuiting peoples’ motivations someone with enough historical knowledge to know what a first-century Galilean fishing boat might actually have looked like. Simon Peter one of the main characters is married to Eden a woman just stubborn enough to live with that most stubborn of disciples. They argue about things: Simon’s business decisions and how to care for Eden’s mother. Matthew the tax-collector is a numbers whiz who has trouble with relationships and appears to have a form of Asperger’s syndrome. His closest companions are a black dog and a towering out of place Roman soldier. Lilith lives in the first-century equivalent of a red-light district. She is possessed by demons and both oppressed and blessed by her memories. She doesn’t tell the men in her life her real name. Jesus is there too but only at the margins of the other characters’ lives. They bump into him at the lakeshore or stumble on his campsite in the woods. One character meets him in a first-century equivalent of a dive bar. Jesus does miracles but they don’t always draw big crowds. He also dresses his own wounds and lights fires by rubbing twigs together. Whether wittingly or not the writers of The Chosen seem to have taken Ignatius’s advice in his Spiritual Exercises—to consider “how the divinity hides itself.” The Chosen’s first season focuses on the early part of his ministry and has eight episodes that run from 30 to 59 minutes. You won’t find the show on Netflix or Amazon Prime. The easiest way to watch it is through a free app also called “The Chosen.” The series is also available on the Internet and on DVD.  Nicodemus (Erick Avari) and Mary Magdalene (Elizabeth Tabish) in The Chosen. Photo courtesy of VidAngel Studios. The show isn’t perfect—no show about Jesus could be. The sets and production values are humble. There is only one recognizable star Erick Avari who plays Nicodemus. Still what they managed with a budget of about $1 million per episode less than a tenth of what a serial drama like The Crown ($13 million) or Game of Thrones ($15 million) has to work with is impressive. More importantly the show has heart. Spirit! It appears to come from people who know what it’s like to have a life-changing encounter with God to be at the end of your rope in the middle of an ordinary life that includes sickness and health riches and poverty weddings death and taxes—all features of daily living that we share with our first century forebears.***Just as heart-ful as the show’s existence is the story of how it came about. I spoke with Dallas Jenkins the creator and director of The Chosen to get the lowdown. Jenkins is an evangelical Protestant by background. He’s also the son of Jerry Jenkins the author of the Left Behind novels and seems to have inherited the story-telling gift. He starts the story of The Chosen in 2017 when he was working on a faith-based comedy called The Resurrection of Gavin Stone. “I had an opportunity to make a movie with some of the biggest production companies in Hollywood. Everything came together really well. It was clear that God was behind it. The investors loved the movie and the plan was to do multiple movies for the next 10 years. I was a director with a very bright future. Then the movie bombed at the box office and I immediately became a director with no future.” The weekend when it became clear that Gavin Stone was a flop Jenkins recalls crying and praying with his wife then staying up into the wee hours of the morning working on a 15-page memo about everything that had gone wrong. During that same early morning he received a message on Facebook from someone he barely knew in another part of the world. “Remember it’s not your job to feed the 5000. Your job is to bring your bread and fish.” The message hit home. “That realization is what allowed me to get to a place where I was open to whatever God had in front of me” Jenkins said. “I wasn’t going to worry about the results or about trying to prove anything. I was just going to listen and obey and make sure that whatever loaves and fish I did have to offer were as healthy and as good as they could be.” Jenkins returned to his church in the Chicago suburbs where he had filmed video testimonials for Sunday services. There a long way from the big Hollywood investors he decided to make a short film for the church’s Christmas Eve service. His goal was to tell the story of Jesus’ birth from the standpoint of a lame and struggling shepherd. He filmed the story at a friend’s farm. In terms of his directing career he says “It was a step down for sure. It was humbling in many ways.” And yet working on the project Jenkins got a new idea: an entire TV series that would tell the story of Jesus through the eyes of those who knew him. A friend gave the 18-minute film he produced dubbed “The Shepherd” to executives at VidAngel a company with a website that allows viewers to filter profanity sex and violence from popular TV shows. VidAngel had been embroiled in lawsuits and wanted to get involved in producing their own content. They suggested that Jenkins use “The Shepherd” as a pilot episode and turn to crowdfunding to raise the millions of dollars that would be needed to produce the series. “I didn’t think crowdfunding was a good idea” Jenkins told me. “I thought it would never work. The VidAngel executives said ‘Let’s put the short film (“The Shepherd”) out on social media and then at the end you can come on and say “We want to do a show like this about Jesus from different perspectives.”’” Jenkins brought his loaves and fishes. God did the multiplication. “The Shepherd” went viral. The Chosen’s website says “The Shepherd” has been seen by more than 20 million people around the world. The Chosen itself attracted more than $10 million in funding from 19000 donors. “Largest-Ever TV Crowdfunding Campaign” blared the headline in Hollywood Reporter. The article described how Jenkins and his partners had offered equity to investors selling shares for $1 each and promising not to receive any profits until investors had made “at least 120 percent on their investments.” The investors would be partial owners of The Chosen in perpetuity a rare way of funding a media venture. “We’re able to say to our investors and to our fans that we literally couldn’t do this without you” Jenkins said. “That’s not just a platitude—it’s real.” Thousands of the investors’ names appear in the credits at the end of the season’s eighth episode. The filming of the first season took place in Texas in 2018. The crew used a model village of Capernaum that had served as a tourist attraction while relying on visual effects to fill in some details (like the miraculous catch of fish from Luke 5) that they couldn’t film directly.***I asked Jenkins how he and his team of writers developed their characters. He said they began with the Gospels and looked to identify personalities that would work well on a TV show that they hope will run for eight seasons. “With Simon Peter you’re looking at how temperamental he was and how passionate he was. He was brave about Christ and he also denied Christ and so you think that’s a really unique person a bit of a rollercoaster ride of a personality. He’s also married. So what must it be like to be married to Simon? And if he was a little bit crazy after he met Christ he must have been a little bit more crazy before he met Christ.” The Simon Peter of The Chosen does have a fiery personality. He gets in fights and lands himself in deep trouble with the Romans after failing to pay his taxes. When he finally meets Jesus in the fourth episode it’s clear that he needs a miracle and it’s easy to understand why he would fall to his knees before Jesus and say “I am a sinful man.”  Jesus (Jonathan Roumie) heals a leper in The Chosen. Photo courtesy of VidAngel Studios. Jenkins said he is deliberate about a slow build up to bigger emotional moments. He didn’t want to make a show like others he’d seen that “go from miracle to miracle Bible verse to Bible verse and there’s no back story or connection to the people Jesus impacted.” A TV serial gives him time and freedom that a feature film director wouldn’t necessarily have. He adds “I remember when we were filming a scene between Simon and his wife and they were arguing and I realized I’ve never seen a marital argument in a Bible show before. And then I realized I’ve never seen a marriage portrayed in a Bible show before!” For all the emphasis on humanizing Jenkins credits God with inspiring some of his best lines and most creative ideas. He mentions a moment when Jesus winks at a character across a dinner table. Another time after Simon has cast his fishing net into the sea he looks back at Jesus with exasperation and Jesus teases him a bit with his expression. “When people talk about how these moments impacted them or brought the stories to life in a way they’ve never experienced I react by saying ‘Wow that’s exactly how I reacted when God first gave that to me.’” Jenkins said the show has drawn criticism from people who worry that audiences won’t be able to distinguish what’s in the Bible from fictionalized scenes. He responds “All I can tell you is that we hear from literally hundreds of people daily and thousands of people overall who say ‘This show has made me read Scripture more than I ever have. This show has made me love Jesus more than I ever have.’ ” Some have criticized the show but an audience Jenkins didn’t expect has welcomed it with open arms—children. “I’ve been shocked by how much kids love the show. I didn’t think the show was for kids because it has a kind of complicated plot. It moves quickly. Yet I hear every day from parents who say their kids as young as seven or eight years old want to watch every episode.” (Parents should be advised that the first episode contains some adult themes.) Jenkins said that the writing for season two is underway and they hope to film it later this year but a lot will depend on funding. VidAngel’s app gives viewers the chance to “pay it forward” by contributing funds that allow others to watch it for free and that will help finance the second season. According to The Chosen app the show’s episodes have been viewed 7.1 million times and they’ve raised $1.2 million from 75479 people toward their goal of $10 million for season two. Jenkins’s own heart for the project is clear and he wears it if not on his sleeve on the front of a grey sweatshirt with bright aquamarine letters that reads “Binge Jesus.” “At the end of the day it’s always going to be about drawing people closer to Christ and to the word of God. But I also think it’s a great thing if people have a show that they can binge-watch that speaks to their faith because that’s really rare right now.”  Dallas Jenkins directing some of the younger actors.

Photo by Beth Kabele. by Chris Meehan Jenny Ridenour (Vancouver-Portland) a mother of two and a hospice nurse was out for her usual Saturday mid-morning run. As she ran across the St. Johns Bridge a steel suspension bridge that spans the Willamette River something caught her eye: a well dressed young woman about 30 standing still at the railing staring into the distance over the Portland cityscape. When she returned across the river a little while later Jenny noticed that the woman had barely moved. As she ran by she felt a prompting from the Lord: You could stop and see if she’s okay. Jenny made an abrupt turn and returned to the woman. She put a hand on her shoulder and asked if she was all right. “No” said Susannah (not her real name). She looked pale and drawn. “Can I pray with you?” Jenny asked. Susannah agreed her tears beginning to flow as Jenny prayed. “God we know how much you love Susannah. She knows you are here with her and that you want to comfort her.” Jenny asked if Susannah wanted to talk about what was troubling her and hesitantly Susannah shared that she had had an abortion. She didn’t feel right with it. Didn’t think she could deal with it. Jenny was aware of the tall bridge they were standing on the long drop to the river. She asked “Were you thinking you didn’t want to live anymore?” “No” said Susannah she did not want to live. At that moment a fire truck and ambulance arrived followed by police cars. A passerby had seen Susannah put her leg on the handrail and called 911. The firefighters blocked off one lane of traffic and the police approached Susannah and Jenny. As one of the officers talked to Susannah trying to assess the situation he kept a tight grip on her arm. The scene attracted a lot of attention from passing cars with people gawking. Susannah agitated clammed up. She wouldn’t give the police a straight answer. She seemed overwhelmed by all the commotion. Eventually Jenny asked the police officer if they could leave the bridge and get out of the spotlight. Susannah allowed Jenny to accompany her off the bridge. The police as well as Jenny wanted Susannah to go for a medical evaluation. Susannah was reluctant. She wanted to go home without calling anyone and without seeking help. Jenny said “Look how much God loves you that he sent all of us here people who can help you. He loves you!” Finally Susannah agreed to be taken to a hospital that assists people in mental health crises. Jenny gave Susannah her phone number saying “Once they let you go text me and I’ll take you back to your car.” Jenny went home praying Susannah would text. Susannah did text later that day. Jenny asked her husband Andrew what he thought of Jenny taking Susannah out for coffee. Andrew responded “Yes and get her something to eat too.” Susannah agreed and they went to a coffee shop together. Susannah said she was a nonpracticing Christian. “I know better. I know abortion is wrong.” Jenny says “I strove to show her the truth. I told her ‘We all make mistakes. Yes it breaks his heart but the Lord can redeem anything.’ The Lord brought back to me pieces of my history and my life in the People of Praise which might be useful. There was no fluff. She and I were open.” When Jenny dropped Susannah back at her car which was parked near the bridge Susannah asked her to pray with her once more. “I didn’t even know God was still doing things in this world” she said.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6958
6960,March 16 2020 1:30 a.m.,Waves of Mercy Waves of Grace,Louis and Nancy Grams in December 2019. Photo by Robert Cunningham PhotoResource MN. by Catherine Bulger On October 6 2006 Louis Grams (now Servant Branch) was pulling weeds in his Colorado Springs garden when he felt a pop in his lower back. He wondered if something had suddenly gone wrong with a spinal fusion he’d had 19 months earlier. Louis took it easy and the pain subsided but then a few days later his blood pressure began fluctuating wildly. He couldn’t stand up for more than a few minutes without feeling faint. “Soon every system in my body was causing trouble” he says. “I was seeing 18 different doctors who struggled to try to treat their share of my 85 different symptoms.” A number of tests eventually led to a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) a rare disease affecting the autonomic nervous system that is effectively untreatable incurable and ultimately terminal. It wasn’t the first time Louis had faced the threat of a terminal disease. In 1997 he was lying in a hospital room close to death from a rare autoimmune disorder. He had congestive heart failure respiratory failure and kidney failure. Then a nurse’s aide he didn’t know entered his room and told him “Today right this moment Jesus is beginning to heal you.” Over the course of weeks Louis’s heart kidneys and lungs all returned to normal amazing his doctors. Louis eventually went around the country proclaiming his healing and praying with others. But in 2006 Louis’s health continued to deteriorate. Eventually his breathing weakened so much that he was tied to an oxygen tank 24/7. In late 2010 he and his wife Nancy made the decision to move from Colorado Springs to Minnesota with its lower elevations. The move helped Louis’s breathing but other symptoms worsened. Louis began using a walker and he started producing “dozens and sometimes hundreds of kidney stones every day.” He had more surgeries and lived with constant pain. He began losing sensation in his arms and hands. In 2018 he had two spine surgeries. As a result of the second surgery he says “I regained full use of my arms and hands plus about six inches of height.” But complications in the recovery from that surgery led to extremely intense pain. “The pain was so bad he was immobilized” Nancy recalled. “By March of 2019 Nancy and I were exhausted from it all and were crying out to the Lord for some relief” Louis said. Relief began in the form of a spinal injection which helped block the pain. Then slowly Louis began to recover more normal daily function and his mind which had been in a fog from the pain and the medication began to clear. By late spring he could take walks again with Mick Coleman using his walker and could get around the house without it. In late May recalled Louis “when my men’s group prayed with me—as they had every week for the previous eight years—I felt a sense of peace and hope that I hadn’t experienced before and I knew something was happening.”  Louis and Nancy Grams with their daughters Mary (left Mission Shreveport) and Elizabeth (South Bend) in Shreveport’s Allendale neighborhood in November 2019. In June Louis and Nancy went to a graduation party. They decided to leave Louis’s walker in the car and Louis walked up the driveway holding Nancy’s hand. They planned to stay only a few minutes but they began a conversation in the driveway that continued for 45 minutes. “I had not been able to stand without support for more than three or four minutes for the previous 13 years” Louis says “and here I was standing for the better part of an hour. That was the last day I used my walker.” Since that party there have been many more of both firsts and lasts. Firsts: Walking three miles. Climbing stairs. Standing for more than two hours. Singing with full voice. Consistently normal blood pressure. Lasts: Kidney stones. Diabetes medicines (thanks to significant weight loss). CPAP breathing machine at night. “All my systems are working better. I notice things I didn’t notice before for example when reading a book or watching a movie. I’ve started studying Spanish.” In September 2019 Louis took a trip to Glacier National Park with some community brothers and hiked at 6500 feet without needing supplemental oxygen. Louis’s doctor told him “This hasn’t happened in the way your healing did in 1997 but there is no doubt that this is a miracle all the same.” “I have been surprised that Louis’s healing is so total especially at age 74” Nancy says. “The fun part is telling everyone because you know that this is a faith-builder. I tell people all the time: neighbors in our condo building the clerks in the grocery store the ushers at our church. They say ‘Wow Louis is really looking good.’ They can see the miracle. “We have an old friend who saw Louis playing the piano at Deb O’Connell’s funeral. He came to me in church the next day and said ‘Nancy are his kidney stones gone too?’ I looked straight at him and said ‘Yes Dave they are.’ He was speechless just dumbfounded. It brought me to tears of joy.” Louis adds “In late January I had a checkup and all my systems are almost boringly normal. I haven’t had normal in so long that it’s still exciting. Every day whatever I do is new and there’s a sense of adventure to it all. “I love seeing people’s reactions when they see me looking healthy without my walker. Joel Kibler (Vancouver-Portland) was in town and he walked right past me did a double take and said ‘Oh it’s you! I almost didn’t recognize you.’” In August Louis gave a sharing to Servant Branch about his healing. He normally sits at the piano bench for the whole meeting but now everyone saw him walk to the microphone unaided by a walker. The branch spontaneously rose to its feet in a burst of praise and gratitude to the Lord. Louis said in that sharing “Fortunately a lot of people believed that God had not used up his healing mercy for me in 1997 or any of the other times he healed me. “In the end all I know how to say is “Thank you Jesus. Thank you my brothers and sisters who have prayed for me so faithfully through the years. Thank you for your persistence. Thank you Lord for your mercy. Thank you for healing. Thank you for your love.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6960
6924,Jan. 17 2020 3:09 p.m.,Third Blue Ribbon Award for Trinity School at River Ridge,Photo courtesy of Trinity School at River Ridge by Catherine BulgerOn November 15 at an awards ceremony in Washington D.C. the U.S. Department of Education recognized Trinity School at River Ridge as a National Blue Ribbon school for the third time.River Ridge was the only private high school in Minnesota to win the award in 2019. It’s also the only high school in the state to have earned three Blue Ribbons and it was one of only 50 private schools in the United States to win the award in 2019.This is the ninth time a campus of Trinity Schools has won the Blue Ribbon.“The award is not just a recognition of the school and educational outcomes but also a recognition of the hard work and dedication of the administration staff parents students alumni and many generous benefactors who form the River Ridge community” said Jon Balsbaugh the president of Trinity Schools.The Blue Ribbon helps spread the word about the school to prospective parents. About 5500 people viewed the school’s Facebook post announcing the award. That’s ten times the views any other post has ever received according to Head of School Beth Schmitz.“One of our goals as the People of Praise is to educate as many young people as we can in a ‘true and integral Christian humanism’ as The Spirit and Purpose of the People of Praise says” noted Craig Lent the overall coordinator of the community and chair of Trinity’s board of trustees. “We hope that the Lord will use news of this award to help us attract more students to Trinity. We are so grateful to God who called us to open Trinity nearly 40 years ago and continues to sustain us and bless us.”“Part of the reason we considered sending our kids to Trinity when we’d never heard of Trinity never heard of the People of Praise was because it had just won its second Blue Ribbon” said parent Christin Croll Carlson.Christin hopes that the award can be a tool that will allow more parents to experience the blessing that Trinity School is. She says “Parents need to know that this is out there that you can graduate from high school without alcohol or sex. That you can learn to think for yourself. That you can hold your own in an argument. That you can develop manners and intelligence and still be a teenager. People don’t believe that this is possible. But it is.”When the award was announced in September Beth told the students during an assembly “This award is an acknowledgment of excellence that for us is ordinary life. It’s appropriate that it’s ordinary because that’s what we’re created to do but it does cumulatively add up to something that is extraordinary.”And so the students and faculty ate cupcakes celebrated their recognition and then went back to their math problems and recorder playing and drama productions and spirited discussions and MATLAB programming—back to their ordinary work of learning together.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6924

6888,Oct. 20 2019 2:58 p.m.,Going Home to Grenada,The mountains of Grenada viewed from Mount St. Ervan Retreat Center. Photo by Catherine Bulger. by Catherine Bulger In August of 1988 Catherine’s parents Jim and Beth Bulger (Servant Branch) moved to Grenada with two-year-old Catherine and six-month-old Annie in tow. The community sent them to implement a high school Christian Family Life program that Laurie (Tychsen) Magill (northern Virginia) and Linda Porto (South Bend) had written for religious education teachers in Grenada at the request of the then bishop of Grenada the Most Rev. Sidney Charles. The Bulgers shared People of Praise life first with John and Amy Zwerneman and before long with Grenadian branch members as well. The Bulgers lived in Grenada until May 1991 when Catherine was five. Twenty-seven years later in February 2019 she fulfilled a longtime hope to return to Grenada and see her former home again traveling with her parents who visit annually on behalf of the community’s branch relations office. Part I: Remembering a Distant Home Before a Long-Awaited Return Nutmeg lime coconut mango ginger. The warm smell of spices in the air. Tall palm fronds waving gently high above my head. The deep deep endless green. The ferns on the mountaintop. Little green-brown funny lizards scurrying down the walls. Juicy ripe fruit with brilliant sweetness exploding in my mouth. Goats grazing in the yard when we came home from church. Women walking on the roof of the cocoa-processing plant outside our kitchen window stirring the cocoa pods with their bare feet.  Jim Bulger holds daughter Catherine while Beth holds Annie in Grenada circa 1988. V&B Archives. These things flit across the edges the beginnings of my memory. I see people places images. I remember our house: our wrap-around veranda the mosquito netting on the beds the laundry tub out back. The prickly pear cactus that the cat liked to sit in. The two swings my dad built for us under the trees. The bats swooping through the living room at dusk. And our cat Salty named by Annie and me that we got to catch the bats (she was bad at it). I remember racing Annie down the long lane flanked by rows of stately royal palms at Mount St. Ervan Retreat Center. Ordering BLT sandwiches at the restaurant on La Sagesse Beach (the taste of all the fresh-caught fish so wasted on us). Riding the waves to shore in my floaties and trying to walk on the water because I had plenty of faith just like Jesus said. I remember eating pieces of fresh coconut in the kitchen and drinking fiery homemade ginger juice and popping the fleshy little fruits called skin-ups in my mouth and my favorite treat: sweet chewy translucent-red guava cheese candy. Once we found five newborn kittens under our bunk bed. One day I woke from a nap to learn I had a baby brother Joseph. There were Lord’s Day meals on our veranda with the fledgling People of Praise branch. And long evenings at John and Amy Zwernemans’ home while the adults played Uno and other games. Sometimes we’d go to sleep there and get up to be driven home late. Early memories are funny though. As time passes I become less sure of them. How much is truly real? How much is influenced by the pictures I’ve looked at by the stories we’ve told again and again?  Vivid bougainvilleas were in season decorating walls across the island. Photo by Catherine Bulger. Back in Minnesota we did tell and retell the stories. We did treasure our photographs and we savoured for years a jar of bay leaves we collected off our Christmas tree—along with a jar of nutmeg and a little hoard of guava cheese. We would eat one tiny slice of that guava cheese on the rarest of occasions and I would nibble it slowly treasuring those morsels like a bit of heaven in my mouth. I know this anyway. I know how my heart leaps when I see a Grenadian brother or sister at a People of Praise leaders’ conference. I know the tears that welled in my eyes when I went to Jamaica in 2002 and realized I was back in the Caribbean at last. I know the flavors that are dearest most familiar most comforting to me are nutmeg coconut ginger lime mango. I know the sound of calypso music or a steel pan drum makes my eyes light up. And this: I’m going home. Part 2: The Return I step out of the small airport into the bright tropical sunshine. The air is warm and pleasant dry and breezy. Dominic Jeremiah the branch leader is there giving me a big hug flashing a smile. I had wondered if I would cry but I don’t. Instead I sit in the front passenger seat of Dominic’s van as he drives us across the island from the main city and capital of St. George’s to the town of Grenville on the east side of Grenada.  Catherine and Jenny Jeremiah above St. George’s harbor. They were visiting the school where Dominic Jeremiah is the principal Presentation Brothers’ College. Photo by Jim Bulger. I stare out the rolled-down window hardly hearing a word of the conversation between Dominic and my parents. Cars honk on the busy curving roads whipping past each other around treacherous corners. We wind upwards high above the calm turquoise harbor dotted with bright-colored fishing boats into the rainforest of Grand Etang National Park with its extinct volcano that forms the center of the island and there they are: great banks of ferns—my ferns! And banana trees palm trees towering bamboo stands. I feel the cool dampness of the mountaintop. It starts to rain. It’s the middle of the dry season and Dominic jokes that we brought the rain with us. We drive down the other side of the mountain into a quieter homier world. Open-air shops and houses line the hillsides in shades of pink orange blue green and yellow. People sit outside on their verandas and stoops. Sheep graze in yards. Strings of Grenadian flags—red yellow and green—decorate rooflines. We slow down outside a white cinderblock house with a pinkish tin roof next to a cocoa-drying factory. “Do you recognize it?” Dominic asks. “I thought it was bigger!” Our old house. Three minutes later we pull into Dominic and his wife Jenny’s driveway. Jenny has made us supper. Pea soup and I remember: Annie and I used to shuck pigeon peas on our veranda—a chore we loved. Besides the peas there are dumplings and yams and breadfruit and green bananas and pork.  A dinner at the Jeremiahs’ house. From left: Dominique Jenny Danielle and Dominic Jeremiah Jim and Beth Bulger. Photo by Catherine Bulger. After supper I stand on Jenny’s veranda and watch the bats circling the electric light in the yard. Jenny and I walk down the lane to the main road. We wait at the corner until Lucy Ogilvie picks us up. We drive through the old busy little harbor town of Grenville to Walter and Ann Ogilvie’s house for a branch meeting. “Good night!” the brothers and sisters exclaim as they enter the room using words that serve as both greeting and farewell in Grenada. Everyone keeps telling me “Welcome home!” It’s an adults-only meeting and about 15 people sit around the living room in a tight circle. My dad gives a short talk. There’s some general sharing and conversation. We sing praise and worship songs unaccompanied but with much clapping and harmony. After the meeting Jenny announces to a laughing audience that we are having “fellowship and swallow-ship.” Mercedes Ogilvie and her sister Lucy list our drink options: mauby light sorrel coconut water and ginger. Soon I’m holding a glass of ginger juice: ginger root steeped in sugar water spicy and sweet a drink I remember so vividly. I sip my ginger in a happy daze and listen to my Grenadian brothers and sisters laughing and talking and affectionately teasing one another. *** For the next few days I don’t talk as much as usual. People keep asking me if I remember things. Some things—the flavors most of all the smells many of the plants the colors—feel familiar but there are many details I do not remember. There was a major hurricane (Ivan in 2004) that necessitated a great deal of rebuilding and replanting. There are more cars on the road more stores in the towns more houses. I look different from most Grenadians. I sound different. I have to strain a bit to understand the Grenadian accent. I feel like a stranger a foreigner in my homeland.  The young adults showed Catherine around the island. Here they take in a panoramic view of the Atlantic Ocean. Photo by Catherine Bulger. The young adults take me on an island tour. Mercedes and Lucy organized the trip and Sabrina Ogilvie with her son Liam Che and Felicia Alexander and their brother-in-law Ryan come along too. We pile into two vehicles and spend the day driving up the east coast of the island. We visit a waterfall a former airport a 300-year-old rum distillery that still operates using 18th-century methods a crater lake a couple of glorious beaches a sulfur spring and a mangrove forest and bird sanctuary. Fruit trees grow everywhere: breadfruit and lime orange paw-paw and soursop. Mercedes has a fruit-bearing mango tree that grew from a pit she accidentally dropped in her yard. There’s almost always a breeze blowing off the ocean and often you can hear vinyl kites whining high in the sky like lofty giant mosquitos as the wind whistles against them. One evening my parents and I come back to the Jeremiahs’ house from a long day driving to some of our old haunts. Mercedes comes over and joins us for supper. We sit around the table eat delicious food drink a bottle of wine and talk like I have so many times before in community. I notice that all the strangeness all the sense of being a foreigner is gone. ***  The group stopped for lunch on Bathway Beach. Photo by Catherine Bulger. On Saturday evening the whole branch gathers at the Jeremiahs’ home for a Lord’s Day opening meal. There are about 18 adults and maybe a dozen children. We will be eating oil down—the national dish of Grenada a coconut-milk-based stew laden with breadfruit vegetables and meat and boiled for hours—as well as chicken and fish and salads and rice and peas and pumpkin and cake and ice cream. I listen to Dominic leading us in the familiar prayers I’ve heard almost every Saturday night of my life. “We praise you for the blessings of the past week: for life health and strength for home love and friendship.” Often when I hear those words I think of Grenada because my earliest memories of opening the Lord’s Day are here. My parents told me that it was in Grenada that they started making a point of regularly opening the Lord’s Day. Now here I am celebrating the Lord’s Day back in Grenada full circle. Grenada is home still not only because of nostalgia or memories or formative experiences but because my covenanted brothers and sisters are here. I sing in my head and my full heart over and over the song “What shall I say unto the Lord? All I have to say is thank you Lord.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6888
6907,Oct. 20 2019 2:58 p.m.,10 Things to Do at Servant Camp,Third and fourth grade girls attempt to get across the poles without touching the ground. Photo by Andy Bowar. by Sean Connolly Editor’s Note: I spent my first week at Servant Camp in August serving as an assistant counselor for the third-grade boys a.k.a. the Bears. These are my top takeaways. 1. WEAR THICK-SOLED SHOES. When I arrived at Phillippo Scout Reservation fellow counselor Mike Wacker (Servant Branch) inspected my carefully selected thick-soled sandals (with socks per the rules) and broke the bad news “Sandals have to be closed-toe.” With just a little bit of a gleam in his eye he showed off his Hoka running shoes their soles as thick as a couple of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The pair of running shoes I had brought had extremely thin soles. I’ve run marathons I figured I’ll be fine. Wrong. By Wednesday I would be begging for mercy strategically seizing every opportunity to park myself on the ground and then feeling my feet ache late into the night. Gravel roads have a way of reminding you just how many nerve endings there are in each of your feet. It’s about 7000. Trust me you don’t want to learn their names. 2. GET COFFEE IN THE STAFF LOUNGE AT 6:00 A.M. Servant Camp runs according to certain predictable patterns and rules. Breakfast lunch and dinner will each be followed by dodgeball for the boys. The metal snap hooks that connect the American and Canadian flags to the halyard will clang delightfully against the pole during a reverent silence. And my personal favorite: there will be coffee in the staff lounge at 6:00 a.m. Credit for the coffee goes to Bob Pintozzi retired dean of boys at Trinity School at River Ridge who rises at 5:00 to start the 100-cup percolator that he had prepped the night before. “It’s a great job if you want to be a hero” he said.  Campers gather every morning to raise the flag and sing. Photo by Andy Bowar. 3. DRINK WATER OR BE HOMESICK. Dr. Paul Zenker leads a medical team with three nurses who give out some 1200 doses of medicine to the 400+ people who attend camp the right dose to the right person at the right time. (One of the nurses Becca Maslow won an award for all the work she did analyzing and organizing data from the camp’s website to make this happen.) But Dr. Zenker’s biggest concern is water. “I will try anything to keep kids hydrated” he told me. He explained: when a child is dehydrated the body pulls water from the gut creating the perfect conditions for clogged pipes. Young kids don’t like spending long periods in the outdoor latrines so stomach pain can erupt. Dehydration also causes headaches. It’s these pains that get the young ones crying for mama. An elegant biological explanation with a clear bottom line: drink water or be homesick. Better yet stop by the medical cabin a few times a day to get some free Gatorade.  Boys head out canoeing on Lake Byllesby.  4. PRAY FOR AT LEAST ONE STORM. On Wednesday our group of third-graders had to abandon plans for a hot dog cookout and hurry to the dining hall: a storm was brewing. As we arrived we saw a shelf cloud forming outside. Inside the packed noisy dining hall the atmosphere was electric with hundreds of us crammed in and everyone talking loudly. Outside the wind started whipping. The sky was darkening. I looked into the eyes of our third-graders seated in a row on their usual bench and saw fear. Then the junior counselors started leading everyone in “I’m a Little Teapot” usually a gentle tune but this time done to the rhythm of the stadium classic “We Will Rock You.” Soon everyone was slapping thighs pounding tables and clapping hands and the boys had relaxed. Down in the basement we started a game of four square and when that petered out a game of basketball with junior counselors serving as hoops. Eventually we got called up to dinner. By the time we were through the storm had passed leaving a glorious effect: cooler temperatures. 5. WALK A MILE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES. After an epic pillow fight in our third-grade boys’ cabin all the boys’ clothes got tangled together. Jimmy couldn’t find his shoes anywhere. This nightmare scenario was relieved when another boy T.J. suggested that Jimmy wear T.J.’s shoes—a gesture that allowed us to leave for the swimming pool. Later that afternoon Jimmy found his shoes. On Peter’s feet! Peter and Jimmy swapped shoes and Peter wore T.J.’s shoes back to camp. All of this proves the point that if you really want to get to know a brother you should walk a mile in his shoes. At Servant Camp it’s possible.  Almost every meal-time one or more age groups were out making and consuming their own grub outside. Photo by Andy Bowar. 6. SHOOT THE CHUTE. There were precious few moments during the week when the attention spans of the eight-year-old boys stayed focused on a single activity but that’s what happened when we made the trip to the two side-by-side sledding chutes. These are corrugated black plastic pipes that run down a steep hill. Campers grab a long plastic sled and crash helmets and whiz down the hill. For added fun you can stack 10 or so of the extra sleds beneath the plywood at the bottom of the chute to create a ramp. Bonus: if you’re willing to do the hard work of peddling a go-kart up the hill that leads to the chute you can have a heck of a good time riding it back down the hill once the sledding time is over.  7. HIKE TO FRIENDSHIP POINT BUT NOT RIGHT AWAY. The hike up to the lookout known as Friendship Point takes ten minutes if you’re with high-school students or about an hour if you’re with eight-year-olds and take a wrong turn. But the view is worth the effort: a panorama of Lake Byllesby a four-mile-long man-made lake with hawks and an occasional eagle soaring above the trees and a view of the camp below you. The boys ate goldfish crackers and balanced on round wooden posts that let you get up a bit higher to see the view. We listened to “Revive this Land” on a portable speaker and though we didn’t say much a sweet feeling set in among us. After surviving epic squirt gun battles bouts of homesickness dodgeball games a storm and long nights in a sweltering cabin we had become something more than a group of boys from four different states. We were a true pack of Bears comfortable in our own skins.  Girls learn knot-tying skills. Photo by Andy Bowar. 8. LISTEN TO THE RHYTHM OF THE FOOTFALLS. On the final night of camp all the units dressed in their new camp T-shirts form up into a procession. Counselor Chris Schwab stands at the front carrying a djembe and four torch bearers line up behind him. Chris intones a rhythm boom-boom-boom-ba-boom-boom-ba-boom-boom and the marching begins. Four hundred pairs of feet crunch in unison over the gravel road then swish loudly over a grassy field then beat softly over dirt then crack resoundingly through a concrete tunnel until finally they enter the amphitheater where each unit takes its place. The drum continues its rhythm and singers lead everyone in the Servant Camp song (to the tune of “Scotland the Brave”). “Glory to Almighty God who gave us Servant Camp” the camp intones as rays of orange light from the setting sun filter through the pine trees behind the stage.  One of the most popular activities at camp is the pedal go-kart track. Photo by Andy Bowar. 9. SING YOUR HEART OUT. Servant campers are always singing. There are silly songs like “The Cat Came Back” about an unkillable cat who survives numerous attempts on his life: shotgun blasts a fall from a hot air balloon even a nuclear apocalypse. In the morning there are chants which often begin with: (Leader) “This is a repeat after me song.” (Crowd) “This is a repeat. . . .” You get the point. But best of all are the praise songs. One of my favorite moments came as our group was walking back to our campsite with the sun setting the moon rising and the sounds of “10000 Reasons” (“Bless the Lord”) reaching our ears from the amphitheater more than half a mile away. At the closing ceremonies the praise songs are loud and go late into the night and as far as I know those hallelujahs are still being raised through the woods and fields of Camp Phillippo.  A brave camper belays off the climbing tower. Photo by Andy Bowar. 10. FALL ASLEEP LISTENING TO BIBLE STORIES. Each night the Bears fell asleep to the sounds of our unit’s head counselor Pat Flynn a.k.a. Papa Bear reading stories from the Jesus Storybook Bible. He takes requests. If you are going to sleep at Servant Camp this is the way to do it.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6907
6886,Oct. 20 2019 2:58 p.m.,Buffalo Camp Celebrates the Shrivers,Tom and Theresa were honored with leis in 2013 for the camp’s 25th anniversary. by Chris Meehan There’s a legend that the original idea for Buffalo Camp which came from Tom and Theresa Shriver first met with some resistance from branch children. Several parents cautioned the Shrivers privately that their children might want to bail out early. One concern was that the location was a derelict 4-H camp where critters abounded. Yet with the Shrivers leading the charge the kids loved it. No one bailed and a decades-long pattern of fun was set in motion. Many of those campers are now grown and send their own kids to Buffalo camp. In 2019 the camp welcomed 101 campers including some from Hawaii Grenada and Barbados. For the first time more than half (61%) came from outside the community. Fourteen attended from the branch’s outreach in Buffalo’s Black Rock neighborhood (see Vine & Branches winter 2017). The camp continues apace after 31 years and some 2000 campers but the Shrivers are passing the baton of leadership. For the past four years they’ve been training their replacements Peter and Sarah Hammer as directors. Next year the Hammers will be at the helm with the Shrivers coming to camp to serve as assistants.  Camp Li-Lo-Li in the Alleghenies site of Buffalo Camp for 13 years. Photo by Martha Delaney. This year’s campers and staff honored Tom and Theresa by placing crowns on their heads and carrying them in a procession in wooden chariots to the dining hall where they were presented with cake and an album filled with camp photos and sharings from former campers and staff members. “It was a little difficult to step down from running camp” Tom said “kind of bittersweet.” “This year’s camp was a sad but happy time” Theresa added. “It was a relief to finish up. We loved leading camp but it’s time to move on.” Both Tom and Theresa are quick to give credit to the efforts of the rest of the branch especially stalwarts such as John (who died in 2018) and Marlene Gehl Martha Delaney and Tim Hammer as well as Bob Pawlosky from northern Virginia.  Older campers served by distributing mulch around camp. Photo by Martha Delaney. The Shrivers say it was never difficult to maintain enthusiasm even after 31 years. No matter how tedious the prep work. “Once we get there the kids’ excitement is contagious” Tom said. “Some kids have been counting down the days from the previous year’s camp so it’s hard not to be excited.” Mary Dufresne who grew up in the New Orleans branch says Buffalo Camp helped form her faith and gave her lasting friendships. “The Holy Spirit stirred in my soul in 2009 when I was about 11. It was the first time I ever saw kids praising God with such zeal. I immediately entered into praise and worship with a completely open heart asking for more! And surely God set the spark flaming. I often refer to camp as the beginning of the Holy Spirit working in me. It was at camp that I learned how to use a prayer journal and hear the Lord’s voice.”  Archery at Buffalo Camp. Branch members Eric and Sarah Dolph and their children Jacob Nicholas and Gabriella honored the Shrivers saying “The impact you’ve had on our lives and our family is immeasurable. Jacob attending camp three years ago set in motion our entrance into the People of Praise which has been such a blessing to our family. Thank you for starting camp and persevering through all of those years.” Bud and Marilyn Northway put it this way in their honoring: “Tom and Theresa’s generous use of their gifts has had a dramatic effect on our children. So many kids from our various branches plus our children and grandchildren and now children from Black Rock have had life-changing experiences at camp. Tom and Theresa’s creative minds never stopped. They were always searching to give our children the best camp experience they could have.”  This year Tom and Theresa were crowned king and queen and rode in kid-powered chariots to a camp-wide celebration. Photo by Martha Delaney. This year’s theme for camp came from a song by Christian songwriter Tim Timmons called “Everywhere I Go.” Like Tom Timmons has survived cancer. He was diagnosed with incurable cancer in 2001 and given five years to live. Eighteen years later he is still writing songs. At Peter Hammer’s suggestion Tom wrote Timmons a letter telling him about the camp and his own battle with cancer—surviving a malignant tumor on his spine. Timmons sent back a video message for the whole camp. Summarizing the theme of his song Timmons said “Every day everywhere I go Jesus is at work. He’s not done with me yet and apparently he’s not done with you yet. He has huge things in store.” It was a message aimed at the campers but no doubt his words echoed in the hearts of Tom and Theresa faithful servants who continue to find new ways to share the love of Jesus everywhere they go.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6886

6846,Feb. 14 2019 4:46 p.m.,Alive in Christ: Living with Brain Tumors,Geriann says “All this stuff is going on but I am filled with joy.” Photo by Anne Raway. by Elizabeth Pease It’s a drizzly day in mid-October when I ring Geriann Raway’s doorbell for a chat. She greets me with a smile and a hug. Inside she’s making a microwavable muffin for me in a coffee cup. Geriann has always fed her guests. She asks me cheerily to take a look and see whether it’s done. She can’t see well enough herself to tell. Pouring some tea she overflows her cup with hot water yelping a bit when it hits her hand. I ask if she wants my help. “Oh no I overfill my cup about three times a day.” These more severe consequences of her vision loss began recently but in her manner and bearing she’s just the same Geriann I’ve known for some time. If anything she’s noticeably happier. With her fifth brain surgery since 2002 (not including two gamma knife radiation treatments) pending in November Geriann had used her new white cane to walk up to the microphone at a Servant Branch meeting a few weeks earlier. Her face lit with enthusiasm she drew an analogy between her life and a book with many chapters. “There’s not blindness for me in the final chapter. There aren’t brain tumors in my final chapter. There’s no suffering; there’s no worry; there’s no anxiety. All that fills me now that is horrifying is not there. The final chapter is total glory. It is more than my mind can fathom. “But now we have to go back to what I call the filler chapters. Those are what lie ahead of me.” And in these middle chapters one of the key plot lines involves a tumor called a meningioma located in the lining between the brain and the skull or the meninges. The tumor tissue doesn’t grow very fast but it does grow and it can spread in a process called tumor seeding spawning multiple tumors in various locations in the brain. Left unchecked these growing tumors push on parts of the brain which can result in a variety of symptoms. Geriann’s largest tumor causes vision disturbances by pushing on the part of the brain that processes visual information and it’s been as large as an egg when removed during surgery. Her other tumors aren’t operable because they’re close to vital brain structures but don’t currently cause symptoms. After a previous surgery in February 2017 Geriann had experienced some improvement in her vision but around Labor Day in 2018 her vision suddenly worsened. The tumors were growing again. “The doctors say there’s no cure for this . . . no hope. They want to keep me from becoming totally blind—that’s the number one priority—but the tumors won’t stop growing. They will affect major organs. There’s a huge risk of stroke and seizure. So medically they don’t have any answers.” As Geriann sips her tea she tells me the story of her recent conversations with the Lord about her situation. “When I found out that the tumors were growing this last time I felt like I had an agony in the garden a time of seeing myself in the night in the dark at this rock praying ‘Father you love me. How could  this be?’ When Jesus was in the garden he sweat blood. I don’t feel like I’ve ever sweat blood. Here I am I just have a little medical crisis. It is not like people hate me or people are out to kill me. Everybody I know is out to help me. But Jesus knew he was facing death. How could his Father who loves him allow that? I was just trying to wrap my mind around that. “I trust God more than I ever have. This is not the first time I’ve faced the possibility of blindness. It’s not the first time I’ve faced the possibility of death. And to look back and see God’s faithfulness I’m embarrassed to say that I don’t trust him fully fully. I can look back and say ‘Why am I not just fully fully trusting in him?’ because I have a history of him being faithful to me.”  The Raways took a moment for a family photo when they were all in the same place at Laura Kane and Jared Gonzalez’s wedding in Indianapolis on October 6.

Geriann had struggled through months of debilitating headaches and had received several unsatisfactory diagnoses. Then her primary care doctor noticed an elevated white blood cell count and decided to run more specific tests. While waiting for the results Geriann was out shopping at a store with her kids and suddenly felt like she was going to pass out. She rushed home. Laid out on the couch she happened to get a call from Janice Mertz just wondering what she was up to that day. On hearing about the situation normally mild-mannered Janice threatened “You call the doctor right now or I’m calling him.” In the ambulance ride to the hospital Geriann overheard the driver say “She’s doing really well for someone with a brain bleed.” But it wasn’t a brain bleed it was tumors—requiring immediate surgery. “I didn’t have time to react then other than to be super-concerned for my children. I begged God to keep me alive for their sake.” While the surgeries over the years have helped Geriann says “I’ve always been a very capable independent person and right now I am not capable. I cannot be independent. While that’s frustrating there’s also a real freedom. I’m stiller than I’ve ever been. The Scripture verse ‘Be still and know that I am God’ was given to me years ago. That’s a major change for me—being okay with being uncomfortable. Now I can say that but I’m not really okay with being uncomfortable. I’m just trying to live more in the Spirit and less out of who I am and my own capabilities.” Geriann squirms leaning forward in her chair as if to emphasize her discomfort with the very idea of sitting still. Another thing that Geriann had to relinquish to her tumors was her job. She had spent several years working as a legal assistant in a small-town law office in Prescott putting her organizational skills to good use by keeping files and appointments in order for a busy lawyer—until her vision symptoms had made computer work and driving no longer possible. When I spoke to her husband Chris in January to confirm some medical details I asked him what he sees the Lord doing with Geriann in this process. He didn’t hesitate at all. “I see her submitting to God in ways that none of us ever want to. As she loses the ability to do things that are dear to her—reading crafts sewing biking driving things like that or even enjoying a sunset—she can still see God in it and be in a state of detachment: ‘Lord you’re the one. I live for you. It doesn’t matter what happens to me.’ That’s amazing.” “It’s crazy” she said “but I told Chris that I don’t know that I’ve ever been happier in my life. All this stuff is going on but I am filled with joy. Really I am filled with joy.”  Chris and Geriann have ridden in the Bike MS: Ride Across Minnesota a 300 mile bike ride for a number of years. Because of Geriann’s vision loss they did the ride together on a tandem bike in July 2018.

They have five adult children all of whom have moved out of state to join various works of the People of Praise.  Geriann’s five surgeries haven’t been enough to stop her from entering into family life and outreach to St. Paul’s west side.

Actually that has opened more doors. I’m physically here in the house during the day and there are a lot of neighbors around. If I still had a job I would miss a ton of opportunities. A lot happens just because I’m here and a neighbor can drop over or I can drop over to a neighbor’s or I can see someone across the street and walk over. So that’s been surprising to me. I didn’t think about being available in that way. “I sit out on the porch a lot and it feels like every time I sit there someone will come by and a conversation happens which is a very fun thing. People walk by and they will stop and talk. Here on this block we had a couple who were renting part of a house. They had several children and we met them just as neighbors not really knowing their situation. I invited the woman to come sit on the porch with me and she began to talk about her life. She kept referring to herself as ‘a signer.’ I finally had to say ‘I don’t know what a signer is.’ Well it turns out a signer is a person who stands on the side of the road with a sign saying ‘homeless’ begging for money. She said ‘Now that you know I’m a signer do you want me to get off your porch?’ I said ‘Absolutely not!’ “This family had been homeless for years sometimes living out of a car. Winter in Minnesota is terribly terribly hard and somehow they were able to rent space temporarily in this house nearby. Then she began to share about herself. She has some mental health issues and she was raised in a totally unstable situation. “I think it was partly God’s way of helping me recognize all that I’ve been given. I didn’t choose the family I grew up in. I didn’t choose my parents. Those are gifts to me. Here was someone who was not given those gifts. And she was struggling struggling struggling and I was seeing the confusion in her life.  Photo by Mary Brickweg. “One night Matt and Mary Brickweg who live next door to us invited this family over for supper. They couldn’t remember ever ever sitting down as a family for supper. Anywhere. Or ever being invited to anyone’s house for supper. Can you imagine? Not even really knowing what a family meal should look like? “So a couple weekends ago I felt like ‘Lord they’re here. What can I do?’ I knew that the mother was trying to get the kids in school and that meant she was trying to work and I felt I should just make them a pot of soup. It was a thought that I felt came from the Lord. It’s not much but I thought I could feed them something simple and basic give them something so that when she comes home from work she can put a meal on the table for them. So I made a pot of soup and a pan of cookies. I wasn’t comfortable delivering them alone because the situation they’re living in is not a good situation so I called one of the neighbors who loves them a lot and asked ‘Would you be willing to go with me to deliver the soup?’ She said ‘Oh they moved. They packed up their vehicle over the weekend and left.’ So now they are states away and we don’t really know where they’re going. But then I felt like the Lord said ‘Don’t worry about it. You still have prayer. That will always be a gift. You can always intercede for them.’ “As it turned out another neighbor stopped by that day who had recently had a baby and I was able to give the soup and the cookies to her and it all worked out—all because I was just sitting on the porch.”***  Geriann and Chris Raway.

After surgery on November 15 2018 in Arizona Geriann cracked jokes and made phone calls in the hospital room but during the next few weeks she had her most difficult recovery yet from a surgery. Beginning in September she’d been on steroids to reduce swelling in the brain and she experienced disturbed sleep and very low energy. She says it took a big effort to move each leg in order to walk. She had a persistent hacking cough for which the pulmonologist couldn’t find a specific cause. Not only that but two weeks after surgery Geriann’s vision was worse than it was before which was a big disappointment because she’d expected to see some improvement by then. “I felt an invitation from the Lord to walk with him into darkness and him saying that he would take my hand the whole way that I would never be alone.” On Christmas Eve she was able to stop taking the steroids and from then on she started to see gradual improvements. On December 29 she was riding in the car with her kids to a family party and noticed that she could read some street signs something she hadn’t been able to do for months. She hadn’t expected to have any vision improvements so long after surgery. “That’s been super-encouraging” said Geriann. “It means I can read my calendar. I can pick up my phone and push buttons on it. I can even read a recipe out of a book which I hadn’t been able to do. I can tell if I’m putting my shoes on the right feet.” She also said she’s gaining a little bit more energy every day. Geriann’s oncologist hopes to slow the tumor growth using drugs but he wants to allow her three months for healing before starting anything new which Geriann sees as a relief. “For me I’m always going back to this: I’m a child of God. Children don’t have to understand everything that’s going on or be in charge of the environment. That’s God’s part. I just need to cooperate with what he’s doing.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6846
6842,Feb. 14 2019 4:46 p.m.,Retirees Move to Louisiana to Serve at Praise Academy,John and Jo Zimmel work hard at making academics and recreation fun for the children at Praise Academy. Photo by Dave Hrbacek for The Catholic Spirit. by Dave Hrbacek Editor’s note: This article was originally published in The Catholic Spirit the publication of the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. It is used by permission and has been edited for length. “Miss Joan my daddy’s in jail. They came and picked him up this morning.” A child delivered this news to his principal Joan Pingel at a small school in Shreveport Louisiana before the beginning of the school day. Her job for that day became figuring out how to help the student and his three other siblings at the school navigate their trauma while trying to focus on the basics of reading writing and arithmetic. That particular event happened about two years ago but that kind of occurrence is common in the Lakeside neighborhood of this low-income city population 194000. Lakeside lies within the poorest ZIP Code in the state where torrential downpours throughout the year pound homes to the point of collapse yet many people including the school’s families don’t have running water. Such squalor is why Joan 52 lives in Shreveport not just to run the school Praise Academy at Lakeside but to live two houses down from it. Joan a lifelong educator moved in 2004 from South Bend Indiana to serve the poor in the Lakeside neighborhood and then took the principal job when the Christian school opened in 2015. The owners of the house where she lives are John and Jo Zimmel from St. Paul who decided to use their retirement years to as they put it “serve the Lord.” They moved to Shreveport a year ago and they have committed their lives to volunteering at the school and in the surrounding neighborhood which is plagued by violent crime prostitution and drugs. Jo 64 is a retired physical education teacher John also 64 is a retired chemist. They wear many hats in the course of a school day which begins with breakfast at 8 a.m. and ends at 3:15 p.m. Family reunion The Zimmels’ arrival in Shreveport last October was a reunion of sorts. They joined two of their four adult children David Zimmel and Jeanette Duddy who already were living there and serving the neighborhood as part of the People of Praise to which all four belong. All of the Zimmels knew what they were getting into when they chose to live in Shreveport. They accepted the poverty and hardships of inner-city life wanting simply to make a difference. They feel they can best do that by living and serving in the midst of people they know are in need of God’s love—and their help. “To me that’s connected with what Pope Francis is saying” said David 35 a leader of a division of the People of Praise called Christians in Mission which serves in Shreveport and several other low-income neighborhoods in the United States. “The poor are a holy people. We talk in America so much about fixing the poor and fighting poverty. [But] there is a thing that’s called ‘holy poverty.’ And while we need to really help people who are destitute and do good acts of mercy our goal is not riches. Our goal is being with Christ. The people that I’ve met in this neighborhood have something that I would never want them to lose—a real genuine faith the Spirit of God.”  Three of the older students enjoy their daily reading time. Photo by Dave Hrbacek for The Catholic Spirit. What their neighbors wanted That’s what he discovered when he went door-to-door several years ago to ask the people what kind of help they wanted from the missionaries. It was already obvious they needed economic assistance. Dilapidated houses dotting the neighborhood—some on the verge of collapse with gaping holes in their roofs and crooked foundations—were clear signs of the perpetual poverty plaguing the people in this mostly African-American district of Shreveport. When the People of Praise started offering a four-week summer children’s Bible camp in 2003 neighborhood parents and guardians responded enthusiastically. More and more children came each year and now the camp draws as many as 150 participants each summer. Seeing this the missionaries decided to focus their outreach efforts on children. But instead of relying on their own ideas they queried people in the neighborhood. David was part of a team that hit the streets to visit residents. “We went out and talked to every single person within two blocks of our homes with an open-ended question: What does God want us to do?” he said. “As I talked to more and more people I was surprised that it wasn’t just one person with one idea. It was the whole neighborhood with one idea. It’s like everybody had the same idea which was a neighborhood school—in the neighborhood for the neighborhood—where kids would learn how to pray they’d learn how to read. Every child would be taken care of it would be a safe place.”  A common sight in the neighborhood. Photo by Dave Hrbacek for The Catholic Spirit. In the middle of a block with seven People of Praise houses they turned the largest home into a school. It opened with eight children. There are now 25 all African-American. The adjacent home has been turned into a second school building. Tuition is $7000 a year per student with families paying what they can afford under the school’s “fair share” tuition policy. Some pay as little as $5 a month some pay nothing. None pays anything close to full tuition. It costs $325000 per year to run the school which includes modest salaries for the staff. All of the funds come from private donations. Overall neighborhood outreach is supported by the People of Praise Mission Fund. Educating children who are economically socially and educationally disadvantaged is hard work sometimes exhausting staff members say. During nearly every classroom session someone is misbehaving. Arguments and fights are common. Near the end of a school day in September Jo proudly proclaimed that she did not have to break up a single fight in her three physical education classes.  Jo Zimmel rejoices with a kindergartner over a successful beanbag throw. Photo by Dave Hrbacek for The Catholic Spirit. Enjoying modest gains Small victories like this are celebrated. Any progress no matter how small fuels the drive she and her husband have to work with these children. “When they have a success you’re super-excited” John said. It can be as simple as the time he was working with a student who finally learned that six plus three equals nine. Instead of counting it on her fingers the student calculated it in her head. When she blurted out the answer twice in a row her joy became his. It spreads to the parents too who notice what the school does for their children. Shameka Blair is a 27-year-old single mother of nine who lives in a small home a few blocks from the school. Four of her children ages 4 to 9 attend Praise Academy and David often drives them home when classes are done for the day. “I like this school” Blair said. Her children “are doing great since they’ve been there. When they first went there they didn’t know how to spell their names. Now they know how to spell their names.” At first Blair didn’t trust the white people who moved into her neighborhood David explained. All of the People of Praise members who live there now are white and he said there is a general distrust of white people in Lakeside among the neighborhood’s African-American majority. But she warmed up to the missionaries over time. After many interactions she now says with palpable warmth in her voice that she “loves them people.” And they love her. Joan has become a go-to for Blair whenever a need arises even driving Blair to the hospital to deliver three of her babies including Zechariah who was born Labor Day weekend. “They have helped me out a lot” said Blair who first met them at neighborhood barbecues hosted by the People of Praise. “Especially Mr. David and Miss Joan. Out of everybody I know them the best. They’ve been good to me and my family. . . . They do a good job and they come down and they show love.”  Joan Pingel (left) plays challenge ball with students during recess. Photo by Dave Hrbacek for The Catholic Spirit. Spreading love and help 24/7 For Joan and others at the school which has six full-time teachers plus regular volunteers like the Zimmels their work in the school and community is not so much a job as it is a lifestyle. It’s a calling that is lived out from dawn to dusk no matter the need. That’s evident when the weather gets cold during the winter months and the above-ground pipes of many houses freeze. Joan has learned to call around when this happens to ask if people have running water. If they say no and need to do laundry her reply is always the same: “Come on over.” There are other times when families have run out of food and Joan and others have gone to the store and brought several bags filled with groceries back to their houses. One time she went into the house with one of the children because there were other adults not family members in the house and she feared they might hijack the food. After walking into the living room she sat down on the floor with the children while they ate. This act meant to provide security for the children symbolizes something deeper. As much as the People of Praise members want to help neighborhood residents they also want to get to know them. It means spending time under each others’ roofs. That is why Joan and the Zimmels often invite families over for dinner. Overall they want to live a common life and bring the people of Lakeside into it. David feels the addition of his parents has helped this process along.  John Zimmel helps a kindergartner with her reading. Photo by Dave Hrbacek for The Catholic Spirit. “Like family” “We treat each other like family here” he said. “It’s like one big community that’s all one big family. And the fact that some of us are actually family has made it a lot easier to explain what it is we’re doing.” One current Praise Academy parent was a teenager when the People of Praise arrived in Lakeside. Lacondra Woodson 28 had just lost her best friend to cancer when the first People of Praise families moved in just a few doors down from her family’s home. She opened up and shared her grief with her new neighbors and a bond was formed. She now is married with three children all of whom attend Praise Academy. Woodson made a big sacrifice to live near the school as she works two hours away. She drops off her kids at a friend’s house at 4 a.m. before leaving for work so that she can get there at 6 a.m. She has no complaints about spending four hours on the road every day. “It’s a school but it’s more like home to my kids because we kind of grew up around here” she said. “Just seeing the smile on my kids’ faces when they get home . . . makes me happy. I want the best for my children and I feel that they have the best [at Praise Academy]. I don’t want to take them out of [the school].” One of the school’s foundational principles is one-on-one time with students. It starts with a half-hour of reading with each student every morning. Teachers and volunteers sit down one-on-one with students and listen to them read aloud. Students receive more individual attention throughout the day especially when there are disciplinary issues. Teachers or volunteers will pull a struggling student aside to talk through problems and conflicts. Often the discussion centers on teaching students nonviolent ways to resolve conflicts with other students. It’s challenging because this method is not taught or modeled in most of the homes Joan said. She said she has had to tell some parents that “we don’t fight; we’re not a fighting school. . . . That’s not what we do.” The students’ academic success is coming in small increments enough for staffers to get excited about the future of the school’s graduates. In a neighborhood where some children never get beyond the third-grade level and end up incarcerated Praise Academy students can dream of graduating from high school and even going to college. The school’s lone eighth-grader has declared she wants to go to medical school and become a surgeon. A Praise Academy board member—who spent several decades as an instructor in a college nursing program—has made time to talk with her about the medical field. At the moment there is discussion about trying to raise money so the girl can attend a private high school. Potential donors have shown interest and Joan is optimistic about getting tuition help for the student.  David Zimmel visits neighbors regularly. Photo by Dave Hrbacek for The Catholic Spirit. Here to stay Regardless of the outcome for this student and the other 24 the People of Praise members in Lakeside are there for the long haul. John and Jo have no other retirement plans; they merely say they will reevaluate in a few years. Even if they ever felt like leaving they might have a hard time convincing Joan to let them go. She wanted them to come even before they had made the decision. “When they had decided that when they retired they wanted to look into whether they’d like to move into the missionary field I started praying that they would come to Lakeside” she said. “And when they said they had discerned that this was where they were going to go and they were invited to come I said ‘Wow.’ This huge relief came over me . . . because I know they have a lot of gifts that they could offer.” The list of the ways they serve continues to get longer. John has become a handyman and also has developed teaching skills as he dutifully helps Jo in her physical education classes and spends a half-hour every school morning reading with students. It’s all part of doing whatever they can to advance the kingdom of God in a poverty-stricken area that can seem forgotten by not only the State of Louisiana but even the rest of Shreveport itself. David Zimmel explained how decades ago a freeway was built in Shreveport that essentially cut off this part of the city. At one time the area was home to a robust Jewish community. One of the few signs of that past life is a Jewish cemetery across the street from Praise Academy. Poor residents here continually ask the city and state for help but it’s slow in coming David said. Some local churches including a Catholic parish have offered assistance while others are reluctant to come into the neighborhood. “I really believe these are God’s people” Jo said. “My job isn’t much different than Jesus’ which is to keep on loving them. When I get up in the morning I pray for the love of the Lord to keep on keeping on. It’s not my strength it’s not my feeling it’s my love for the Lord that he’s called me to serve these people at this time. And I’ll give it my best shot with his grace.” This legacy is stretching into the third generation for the Zimmel family as their daughter Jeanette 33 and her husband Thomas Duddy are raising their two children in the Lakeside neighborhood. Like all of the other People of Praise adults—and even some children—the Duddys put in regular volunteer hours at the school cleaning and helping wherever needed. “It’s a real privilege to get to live with the poor” Jeanette said. “Jesus said ‘Blessed are the poor.’. So I feel really blessed to get to live here and be part of our work living next door to people who really need a lot of help need the Lord.” Already Jeanette has seen racial barriers start to fall with some of the neighborhood children keeping pictures of her daughter prompting their friends to ask: “Do you have a white sister?” “I think we’re forming those kinds of relationships with our neighbors” she said. “But it’s taken a while and the opposition is real. There’s been really horrible things that have happened in our [American] history which makes it hard to earn trust and to be friends together. But when you live with people that makes a big difference. If we didn’t live here it would be totally different.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6842
6840,Feb. 14 2019 4:46 p.m.,A semi-truck hit me. God saved my life.,Terry Schmitt. Photo by Tom Bowar. by Terry Schmitt On the night of January 22 1998 at about 11:30 p.m. I was driving a snow plow on an icy snow-covered highway in Minnesota. I was traveling at about 20 miles per hour and in the process of changing lanes. The last thing I remember is checking my mirrors and seeing no vehicles in the other lane. I later learned that a semi-truck loaded with cars was attempting to pass me at about 55 miles per hour. Faced with the decision between hitting me and swerving into oncoming traffic his cab hit my cab on the driver’s side. My plow partner was on the scene within a couple of minutes. He said I was talking and trying to take off my seatbelt but my head and eyes were so swollen with injuries that he didn’t recognize me. I was taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital where I was diagnosed with multiple head injuries. From there I was loaded into a helicopter and transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota. A prayer hotline message about my accident went out to my brothers and sisters in Christ in Servant Branch.  The smashed cab of the snowplow Terry was driving during the accident. Photo courtesy of Terry Schmitt. In Rochester I was diagnosed with a closed head injury with a brain hemorrhage and small facial fractures. I also had pieces of glass removed from my eyes. I was in a semicoma for two days. It was as if the Lord put my mind to sleep and saved me from the trauma of the accident. Even so I was able to respond to the medical teams so that they were able to diagnose me. I remember waking up looking around and seeing all this strange equipment then I noticed that it was all attached to me! I raised one leg then the other. My legs were both there and seemed to be okay. I then slowly checked my arms. I thanked God that whatever happened had not taken any of my limbs. Soon a nurse came in the room and told me I had been in an accident but she didn’t know any of the details. She suggested I use the phone next to my bed. I called the first number that came to mind my brother in Christ Earl Stodden. When he answered I greeted him with “How are you doing Earl?” He was shocked to hear my voice. He told me he had just visited me the night before while I was still in a semicoma and that I had been thrashing in bed. He had prayed over me and so had several other brothers and sisters from the east area. From the time I woke up I did not experience any pain from the accident. My condition improved so rapidly that within a week I was medically stable and was discharged from the hospital. When I left the hospital I still had swelling in my head and eyes but within two weeks my appearance was back to normal. At my first follow-up appointment two weeks after the accident they found that my eyes and ears were in good condition and had sustained no damage. The doctor who examined my eyes that day was the same doctor who had removed glass from my eyes when I first came in. He said that he had no explanation for it but that my vision was 20/20. A CT scan showed that the right side of my brain was swollen and that there was a blood clot from the hemorrhage. I was told that I would need to be patient because brain injuries take a long time to heal and that I would be on an antiseizure medication for six months as a precaution. On March 6 six weeks after the accident I had another CT scan. All brain swelling was gone the blood clot and fractures were gone and the doctors said my brain looked like it had not been in an accident. They told me I could go back to work. Within two weeks I was off all medications. Since I experienced this healing my faith has come alive. Whenever I see people I’m not afraid to ask them if they’d like to be prayed over. I’ve also been called on to speak publicly about the healing including to several large Minnesota Department of Transportation gatherings. I’m not a speaker but God has given me an inner strength to overcome that fear of talking in public and share about what he has done in my life.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6840

6797,Dec. 19 2018 2:10 p.m.,To the Praise of God’s Glory,Nightscape downtown Minneapolis 2012. by Paul DeCelles Photo: Andy Bowar Editor's note: This article is republished from the November 1986 issue of New Heaven/New Earth. My wife Jeanne and I together with four of our children lived in Switzerland in 1965-66. Seeing the ancient cities experiencing older cultures learning new languages were a few of the benefits. I even managed to overcome my fear of heights enough to climb to the tops of magnificent cathedrals—if my children were dragging me! There is a great cathedral in every great town in Europe. In fact there is a great cathedral in nearly every town in Europe great or small. As we approached the heart of a city we would first see these magnificent blocks of stone towered with spires reaching up to the heavens their tops nearly out of sight. Gargoyles peered at frightened children whose fear turned to joy at the crescendo of gongs from mammoth ancient bells ringing to the praise of God’s glory. When driving to Cologne Germany a city about the size of Chicago we rounded a bend in the river road and saw one of the most magnificent of all cathedrals dominating the modern city with its ancient form. We were still two miles from it but we could see the scaffolding around most of the front of it; hundreds of years later it was still being built it seemed. When we drew closer the sky seemed to be filled by this Gothic form creating an image that has remained fresh in my mind for 20 years. Again and again my thoughts and imagination have been drawn back there. The more I have thought of these glorious European cathedrals the more I have found in them a number of analogies for our times. The first analogy has to do with the builders. The most talented artists of the age worked together as cathedral builders for their entire lifetimes. This was artistic talent of the order of magnitude of Picasso Matisse and Rembrandt. Even though so many geniuses worked on them there is a wholeness there that shows no seams between the work of one and the other. They worked together according to a plan. Something of this must be true in our lives. The Lord has a plan for our individual lives but he also has a plan for the whole world. Our individual lives are part of the whole and we need to be like those cathedral builders of old—wonderfully talented people who put all our energies in common to accomplish a great work for the praise of God’s glory—a cathedral so to speak. We need to know a master plan and subordinate our individuality to the purpose of accomplishing it. Like people involved in a centuries-long project of cathedral building we can pour all our energy into building something magnificent for the Lord. An entire town dwarfed by the flying buttresses of a cathedral in construction would be mobilized for the accomplishment of a great work for God. It is not insane to hope that our towns also may live for the accomplishment of the common purpose of serving the Lord. Cities really can be different than they are. Our cities have no common purpose; they make no sense. They are the collections of a vast number of individuals living without a plan for life together. It is a miracle of God’s mercy that we are surviving in our cities as well as we are. Unless the value of the common good becomes a civic virtue believed taught and practiced in our society we will experience the decay from within which the Roman Empire experienced as it fell to the barbarian invasions. Near the end of one exhausting trek to the top of a cathedral spire I paused to catch my breath while the children ran ahead. A small ray of light caused the dust we raised to dance above my head. I stretched far from the narrow staircase craned my neck around and looked through a slender opening to the outside. The cars below seemed smaller than ladybugs. I realized that no one on the street could see me at so great a height. Then looking out and up I saw a magnificent statue tucked into a niche in a small turret to my left. It could only have been seen from the precarious spot where I was standing. I suspect I am the only person who has seen it in hundreds of years. Why put a beautiful statue where no one will see it? Because the only one who was meant to see these things was the Lord of all creation. The builders the townspeople the sculptors the artists all did the work for God for his pleasure. The whole building and thereby in fact most of the town was built for God. What is the motivation in our lives? Why do we accumulate the things we do? Why do we spend our energies on the projects we do? Our lives may very well contain things done for God which no one else ever sees or admires. These especially should give us delight for we know they are exceedingly pleasing to our Lord who sees all things. I am not advocating building more churches of stone and mortar. I am suggesting that Christians seek the Lord the master architect for a plan for the cities we live in. We should be building a Christianity within our cities that will someday tower above and give meaning to everything else our hands have made. It would be a Christianity that strangers couldn’t help but notice as they entered our cities one which would move them to look heavenward for the inspiration of our labors. In order to make that kind of difference we Christians have to put our talents in common. We have to work according to the plan the Lord gives us. Then we have to labor with all our energy and much of our money for perhaps 100 years to build something really good and beautiful and true and holy for the Lord our God. Oswald Chambers wrote in his book My Utmost for His Highest commenting on Matthew 5:30 “There are many things that are perfectly legitimate but if you are going to concentrate on God you cannot do them. . . . This line of discipline is the sternest one that ever struck mankind.” There are many options before us. In the age of cathedral building people spared no expense for the glory of God. What are the cathedrals of today? Football stadiums and towering skyscrapers beehives of commerce cathedrals of entertainment and money. Drive into a modern city and look up—it’s easy to see where our hearts are.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6797
6799,Dec. 19 2018 2:09 p.m.,A Place for All Seasons,by Jeanne DeCelles Photo: Andy Bowar Editor's note: This article is republished from the March 1985 issue of New Heaven/New Earth. Seventeen years ago we bought our first home. We were delighted with it—and still are—because we had rented homes for 12 years and it was refreshing finally to have a place where we could pound in nails let a dog run loose and experience all the other joys of ownership. There is however one truly unique feature of this house: we live directly in front of a very old and charming graveyard. Our children grew up playing in it walking and running in it. (I have even heard rumors that one or two of them tried out several freshly dug graves for size!) They were and are respectful toward the place and fortunately without any trace of superstition or fear. Our youngest son born a month after we moved into this home called all cemeteries “backyards” for years. It is a delightfully unsophisticated graveyard filled with every sort of monument in every shape and size. Statues natural rocks rusty metal crosses massive monuments of marble and granite dignified obelisks markers with wistful old photographs of the person buried beneath stones engraved in Polish and other languages stones dating back as far as the 19th century. None of these new discreet uniform markers buried so neatly in precise rows but a wild almost hilarious profusion of individual tastes and opinions. Seeing that cemetery there year after year brings many thoughts to mind: reminders to be grateful for penicillin and other antibiotics when we see the tiny graves of children who lived only a few months or days; reminders to be grateful for our success in the care of young mothers when we see the markers honoring women who died much too young and left behind young fathers and younger children; reminders that most women live 10 to 20 years as widows in the present century and the bittersweet wisdom which tells us both to be prepared for that life and grateful for the husband who lies beside us at night; reminders to pray for peace work for peace and desire peace when we see the graves of men who died in their prime fighting for peace. It is a marvelous place to walk. Here the seasons of the year are etched so vividly that we regularly turn to the graveyard—and not to the radio—to find out what the weather is like. Spring in the graveyard is a thing of color and excitement. Thousands of flowers appear beside the somber gray stones. Later petunias geraniums zinnias lilies and roses appear some planted years ago in sorrow but many brought in coffee cans by those who do not easily forget. All proclaim the symbolism of this special place the symbolism of new life life beyond the graves surely a better life. One spring peonies seemed to be the stars. They were everywhere and astonishingly profuse and brilliant. A friend recently planted a small maple by her husband’s grave and we meet occasionally on the path now because she has to encourage the frail tree with with lots of water each day. The cedars in spring take on a newer brighter green. The catalpas burst forth in blossom and later the long lazy beans. The maples red and green alike proclaim the rebirth of the earth below. Children suffering from spring fever and looking for a bit of a thrill ring the bell atop the small chapel in the center of the cemetery and run like the wind before they can be caught. Summer comes quickly and the graveyard is less pleasant because the mosquitos are abundant but a brisk bicycle ride around its paths is great exercise and keeps one ahead of the pests who sting and bite. The joggers and serious runners—who came in late afternoon a month earlier—now choose the early morning hours before the day is too hot. The trees keep the paths cool in the evening and one can always use mosquito repellant. Violent summer storms prune the trees leaving dead branches even riven trunks as testimony to their relentless cleansing. But fall is surely the best of times in our graveyard. There have been Octobers when I have walked out to my “backyard” and rushed back into the house to call everyone to come see it. The light like one of Renoir’s paintings is breathtakingly beautiful and never fails to make me long for my mother to be with me to see it. The colors are fierce demanding attention and it is only with great effort that I can stay away. I spend a lot of time there in the fall. Surely I know of no better place to walk to think to pray. The air is so clean it’s hard to believe that it’s not always autumn in heaven! Then winter comes. The cold air is bitter. We wander through the matted leaves my granddaughter and I picking up dead wood for kindling regretting the way we have to crunch the glowing reds and yellows under our feet. It’s too cold to stay long. When the snow falls it will be beautiful again but right now it is cold; death is reflected everywhere. Soon all harshness is covered again and the stones look beautiful and dignified. An ice storm can transform it into a magnificent Disneyland full of sparkle and spectacular magical shapes as the trees take on the glistening beauty of the ice. Our graveyard has seen us through many seasons. In the cemetery my husband has told me many hard and sorrowful things. Also in the cemetery we have shared tender and joyful things. We have gone there to cry and shout out hurts and misunderstandings and disappointments that we could not vent in the house. I have walked there with friends whose hearts were burdened with pain and difficulty and offered what help I could. I have strolled there sharing bright plans for the future with my daughters or with women who were approaching marriage. I have found a good place where quarrels can be settled and hearts reconciled. I have gone there to be alone with my own pain and confusion as well as to celebrate the joys of my life. It speaks to me of many things the graveyard but most of all it speaks to me of new life of resurrection of all the faith and hope and love lived out by the generations who were laid to rest there. When we moved into this house our youngest daughter was about five. There were few young families in the neighborhood and her best friend from the very beginning was an old man who lived two houses away. He was very kind to her and she loved him dearly. When he died of cancer she seemed not to understand it. She told me years later that on the first Easter morning after his death she rose early put on some boots wrapped a coat over her nightie and stationed herself on the small hill between our house and the graveyard waiting for “Grandpa C.” to come back. In a way she was right. Many have gone before us and I like to think that most of them stand in the presence of our Creator and perhaps even think kindly of the lady who spends so much time walking around in this the final earthly dwelling of some of them. We have a spot out there now my husband and I. It is within sight of the chapel near a fine old elm. It does not cause me pain or fear to see our place there. Even if I should die a million miles away and never actually rest in that spot it speaks to me now of the companions waiting for me of the ones who have already seen what I can only hope for and of the special place reserved for me in the life to come. Jeanne DeCelles died in 2015. She was laid to rest in the cemetery behind her old house.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6799
6809,Dec. 19 2018 2:07 p.m.,Can Virtue Survive Camping?,Northern Lights Boundary Waters 2014. by Louis Grams Photo: Andy Bowar Editor's Note: This article is republished from the June 1989 issue of New Heaven/New Earth. I grew up in a home where there was one way to vacation the Annual Camping Trip. As a child I traveled with my parents from coast to coast and far into Canada with hardly a night spent in a hotel. I learned firsthand lessons about the natural sciences social customs history and numerous other areas of knowledge in a way that has enriched my entire life. I learned about cooperation creative problem-solving and a healthy self-reliance. I grew to love creation and its beauties with respect for its dangers and delight in its benefits. The elation of my first hike through the mountains of Glacier National Park is as fresh to me today as the day in 1958 when I made it. Our family could not afford hotels so camping opened a door for us on a world that would otherwise have been out of our reach. When I no longer lived at home I continued to camp combining job and hobby by running a boys’ camp in northern Minnesota and camping/travelling all over North America with staff members on our breaks and at season’s end. I always assumed that camping would be a permanent element of my life. The fact that the woman I asked to marry me had never done any camping somehow failed to register. Once Nancy camped with me I assumed she’d love it for life. As it turned out the first time we camped together we were still engaged and were part of a large group of young adults who worked together as volunteers. We took a break from our service by setting out for an island in Lake Superior where we spent two days biking hiking sightseeing and generally having fun—until The Night of the Storm. Our second night out the storm of the century hit bringing violent winds 10 inches of rain blinding lightning and hail for five straight hours. In my snug little mountain tent and down sleeping bag it was some time before I heard the screams coming from the large tent the women were sleeping in. When I began to pay attention I quickly discovered that they were somewhat disturbed by the foot-deep stream of water covering their sleeping bags and floating their luggage. I got up. One glance told me that either my vision for a life of wilderness camping was about to end or my plans for marriage would. So much for a blissful honeymoon camping in the Canadian Rockies! In the years since that sober night I’ve managed to convince my wife that there is virtue to be gained in an occasional camping trip and I’ve learned to endure the rigors of motel life when there are no other options. In fact I don’t know of many wives who would tolerate the scale of camping our family has since engaged in. About every other summer we have shared our family vacation with close friends camping across the country in places like Yellowstone the Canadian Rockies and up and down the East Coast. It might go without saying that we have learned a few things along the way. First we’ve always looked at our vacations as times to be revived in spirit and body so we pray for our vacations pray during our vacations and give thanks for them afterward. I vividly remember rolling into Yellowstone early one morning with 12 of us seated throughout a modest rented motor home. We drowned out the noises of the road with songs and praise heightened by the wonders passing our windows. As we concluded our daily time of group prayer Nancy prayed that the Lord would bless us with the opportunity to see many wild birds and animals. No sooner had her prayer been spoken than a huge bald eagle appeared at eye level with us descending alongside us into a majestic gorge. The eagle flew at our side for several minutes and then soared off to our delighted cries of thanksgiving. We have also learned that you can never plan too carefully for a trip of any size. From our itinerary to a detailed meal plan to work assignments to packing lists we have found that the more carefully we plan a trip the less confined and limited we feel when we are actually on the road. Last summer our camping vacation nearly got the best of us. A packed work schedule including its own dose of travel before vacation kept us from going through our normal planning routine. I shrugged off the potential problems by saying to myself we’ve done all of this before; no sweat! The intense heat of the summer of ’88 guaranteed that nothing we had done before had prepared us for our two-week 3600-mile endurance test. What planning we had done boiled down to talking about all of the wonderful places in the eastern United States we wanted to visit roughing out a route through them all and not going very far beyond that. Plans to rent a motor home fell through and we ended up packed into our (not air-conditioned) van pulling a pop-up camping trailer and eventually borrowing a car along the way so that the 14 of us who ended up sharing most of the trip could survive. Every day the fact that we had not planned things more carefully added to the stress of a too-ambitious itinerary and too much heat. Everyone did amazingly well but when the joking question “Are we having fun yet?” was asked the laughter was thin. Over the years we have also learned a lot about pace and time on a camping expedition. When we get out in the woods my wife and I find ourselves getting to bed much earlier even when we have a campfire and rising earlier as well. Most things take more time when you are camping. Meal preparation and cleanup are slowed by the lack of conveniences we take for granted at home. In moving from one campsite to another there is a good deal of time required for taking down the first camp packing and then setting up the next camp and unpacking. Routine things such as bathing or washing clothes become major events requiring planning and coordination and more time. Additionally we have learned that even with a relaxed camping routine having some days to do nothing is an important element in the pace of a trip. If a lot of time is spent driving these “down” days are even more important. I’ve had to learn that my ideas about what camping really is (a backpack a tent a down sleeping bag some food and the clothes on my back) need to be adjusted for my companions’ diversity of camping experiences and levels of desire. The change of routine and context affords opportunities for growth in relationships that we don’t normally have to the same extent. Living working and playing together day in and day out under a wide variety of conditions create numerous occasions for growth in knowledge and love of one another. Seeing even one’s spouse or children outside of routine circumstances can create a new appreciation and understanding of them. Some of the best times I have ever had with my sons have come in the context of a mountain hike or a moment of facing some wilderness challenge together. Those times are preserved long after we have returned home. When one of my sons seems distant or withdrawn I often find easy access to him through a shared memory of some particularly good or exciting time camping. Camping also creates numerous occasions to repent and forgive to be patient and forbearing with one another. Superficial forgiveness or feigned patience wears thin very quickly on the third full day of rainy weather or at the 10th hour of a long day’s drive. At the end of one particularly wonderful stay in the Canadian Rockies the Lord outdid himself for us by putting on a display of the Northern Lights that had all 14 of us cheering like children at a fireworks show. As the sky was filled with dancing light from one mountain-rimmed horizon to the other we shouted out thanks to the Lord and asked him to “do another one.” He was bestowing on us the works of his hands far beyond what we could ever deserve. The wonder of that moment still draws me to a place of profound reverence before the Lord. At the same moment in the security of hotels motels and cabins in a not too distant town hundreds of people were settling down to a comfortable night of cable television entertainment. They didn’t deserve any less than what we were sharing at that moment but they had no idea what they were missing.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6809
6807,Dec. 18 2018 10:52 a.m.,Through the Valley of Grief,The Cathedral of St. Paul in St. Paul Minnesota. by Linda DeCelles Photo: Robert Cunningham PhotoResourceMn Editor's Note: This article is republished from the February 1989 issue of New Heaven/New Earth. In 1981 six weeks before his expected delivery date my unborn son died. He was to be our fourth child and I had been looking forward to his birth with great anticipation. His death was totally unexpected and although I didn’t know him I grieved very deeply. For three or four months my sense of loss was constant. Let me share with you how the Lord showed his mercy for me in this situation. Jesus worked in my heart and my mind during that time to bring good fruit from my grief and the abiding faithfulness of his love was slowly revealed. The first fruit was a simple one. I realized that since I had grieved so deeply for that child my love for him must have been deep too. It is always a consolation to know you have really loved someone who has died. It was a particular consolation to me since I had never been able to express my love to him and had not been able to love him through any of my actions. The second benefit was that I was now more human. That sounds strange doesn’t it? How can a human being be more human? What I mean is that my experience of grief was a kind of initiation into another level of what it means to be human. I had entered more deeply into the common experience of mankind. I was one with all the men and women in this time and in the past who had suffered the loss of loved ones. Barriers of language race creed and era fell away. I had compassion on them all. The third fruit of my grief was in my experience of the Lord shepherding me through this “valley of death.” His first task was to convince me not to dwell on asking “Why?” I think it is natural for the human spirit to wonder why such an awful event could take place. The mysteries of pain evil and death have plagued mankind since Adam and Eve. The Lord wanted me to know that if I continued to grapple with “Why did this happen?” I would only intensify my suffering and perhaps jeopardize my faith. The Lord reminded me that the Father’s ways are above our ways that the Father had asked his only-begotten Son to lay down his life and that the Father had asked Jesus’ gentle and innocent mother to witness her son’s crucifixion. In the face of this who was I to question? Jesus seemed to be saying “If you don’t become entangled in why this happened you will be more able to resist the temptation to hold it against me.” Because we know that God is ultimately in charge of everything that goes on we tend to blame him for things that don’t go our way. Actually just because the Lord permits an event does not mean that he is the cause of it. (Look at all the suffering Satan used in tempting Job.) An even more persuasive reason to avoid resenting the Lord was also a very practical one: If I held a grudge against the Lord I would separate myself from the only one who could really help me. The fourth thing the Lord did for me was the hardest but ultimately the most healing. He encouraged me to give my son willingly to him. There are many sacrifices we make for the Lord to show him how much we love him. Many of them are of our own choosing. When loved ones die however their physical presence is taken from us without our consent. Yet we do have the choice of hanging on to our relationships with loved ones or of releasing them to the Lord as offerings of love. Rarely do we have the opportunity to give the Lord anything so precious as this. Actually this was what finally turned my grief into an upward road. Bearing my suffering consciously and willingly became a way to give myself and my love to the Lord. I made the effort to channel my grief into an offering of love to God and over time I began to feel that grief had become my friend. This seemed pretty absurd. I realized one day that it was not grief that I sensed this fondness for but the presence of Jesus faithfully constantly loving me in my grief. Because of my suffering I was living with Jesus in a way I had not experienced before. Although my grief was still there it had become the doorway to and the foundation of the consolation of his love. While friends were praying with me on Pentecost that year my heart was flooded with joy the joy that comes from knowing God’s love. I know and shall never doubt that the Lord in his compassion will be faithful in loving me through grief and pain. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life . . . (Ps. 23).,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6807
6804,Dec. 18 2018 10:51 a.m.,More Than Midway Through,The Old City of Jerusalem taken by Nano Farabaugh during the Sisterhood’s trip to Israel in 2012. by Marge Connolly Photo: Nano Farabaugh Editor's Note: This article is republished from the November 2002 issue of Vine & Branches. “Midway on our life’s journey I found myselfIn dark woods the right road lost.” So begins Dante’s Inferno. When I read these opening lines last year with the Trinity senior girls I asked them if they ever had experienced what Dante was talking about. They certainly weren’t midway through life’s journey at least by my reckoning. But I reading these lines knew immediately what Dante was talking about: that terrible feeling of waking up one morning halfway through your life and finding yourself lost in the dark. Perhaps you know too. Dante begins by trying to climb out of the woods and up a hill he sees before him but his way is barred by wild beasts. He discovers that in order to get out of the woods and back to the light he must first descend into hell seemingly the wrong direction. When he despairs of ever being able to make this journey into the fiery pit he finds he has been sent a guide the poet Virgil. He does not have to travel through the inferno alone. In 1985 I asked for help from a sister in the community because I was in the dark woods of my life. I entered into what may be the longest-running “temporary” pastoral relationship in the community. I don’t think we’re keeping records of such things but from 1985-1997 this sister talked with me weekly sometimes daily sometimes more than once a day to help me with a difficult situation. She was willing to descend with me into the pit holding my hand so I did not have to journey alone into the dark. Sometimes she knew the path and was able to say to me sharply “No! Don’t go there—that way lies madness and betrayal.” Sometimes she’d say “I’ve never been here before. This place looks unfamiliar to me but the Lord knows the way and will show us. Let’s pray.” Many times she repeated “Always be cheerful. Always be courageous. Always have hope.” She said it hundreds of times to me until I had it memorized and was able to say it to myself. When I called her sometimes late at night or early in the morning (how many phone calls over those 12 years!) she never acted impatient or tired of me. When she got angry she was angry with the evil one for telling me lies and in later years when I had learned a little angry with me for listening to the lies. Always she told me the truth: that she loved me that the Lord loved me and that I was not alone. Sometimes I wanted nothing more than to be rid of her like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz who wants to fall asleep in the opium poppy fields and is angry with her friends for insisting she keep going. The way was painful difficult and confusing and I longed to give up lie down and be left alone to wallow in self-pity and fear. Then my sister acted like the Holy Spirit the Paraclete to me. Like the parakletos in Greek battle whose job was to urge the soldiers on in battle she’d urge me not to quit before we reached the light: “Get up! Keep going! You always said you wanted to become holy now here’s your chance” she’d say and sometimes drag me sometimes carry me until we reached a place where we could rest. Eventually with the Lord’s grace the path began to turn upward. One day we saw some cracks of brightness. Finally we emerged into the light together. Looking back I marveled that I had travelled through hell and lived to tell about it. I marveled that she was still with me still holding my hand. She looked older 12 years later when I saw her in the sunlight. She looked tired and worn by the journey; thinner tougher more transparent. But she was smiling as she turned to me and said “See? I told you you would make it! Isn’t God good? Isn’t he faithful?” Who is rich enough to buy such companionship? What kind of money would you have to pay to hire such a guide? Who in her right mind would sign up for such an excursion without recompense or reward? It’s not exactly the vacation dream of a lifetime! Dear sister how can I ever thank you? I do it by writing this testimonial to our covenant which you kept with me as you had promised. “Greater love than this no woman has than to lay down her life for her friend.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6804
6794,Dec. 15 2018 3:26 p.m.,Brotherhood is the Best Medicine,Jim Shrack Wayne Miller and John Carnick. by Wayne Miller Photos: Trish Olson Mary Lou Cressy Editor’s note: Jim Shrack (South Bend) died on November 11. He was 68. His good brother in Christ Wayne Miller offered these remarks at Jim’s wake. Jim and I met in the early 1970s while attending the Wednesday night prayer meeting held at Christ the King church in South Bend. A month or two after we met Jim said he was looking for another place to live. I told him that I had a house and that he was welcome to move in there and he did. Jim had an old English sheepdog the kind you can’t tell the front from the back because of the long hair. The dog had been through obedience school and one of the tools used in training was a little squirt gun. To deter a behavior they’d spritz a little water on the dog’s nose. One day Jim and I had a meeting to go to so Jim asked my brother Greg if he would watch the dog. Jim put the dog on his chain and mentioned something to Greg about watering the dog’s face if he should start barking since Jim didn’t want the dog to annoy the neighbors. We came back and Jim asked Greg how things went. “Just fine” he said. Then we looked outside. It was a sunny February day and we saw the dog with a smile on his face staring right at us with his hair straight back in frozen icicles. I think Jim forgot to mention the part about using the squirt gun instead of a tumbler. Jim and I eventually joined the People of Praise and we were asked to move into a Christian household. We lived with Andrew and Beryl Plodowski in their beautiful home on Angela Boulevard with their son John and with Kay Frey a schoolteacher and also a member of the community. Jim and I had the whole finished basement to ourselves complete with room for prayer and a Ping-Pong table. We played every night. We discussed all the world’s problems and as far as we were concerned we solved every one of them—just no one ever came to ask our opinion. It was at the Plodowskis’ house that Jim picked up an endearing phrase. He would hear Andrew refer to Beryl as “My love” or “Love.” Jim throughout his entire relationship with his wife Jeanie always referred to her as “Love.”  David Bowar (left) and Michael Coney (Mission Indianapolis) give a truck an assist in starting on the South Side of Indianapolis in 2009. One of the biggest things Jim and I had in common was laughter. We went with a group of friends to a Pink Panther movie. There was a scene that was so funny we started laughing louder and louder. The punch lines kept coming one after another. We couldn’t catch our breath. We slid out of our seats onto the floor laughing hoping it would stop because we couldn’t keep up. I found out later on that our laughter had been a bit contagious because as we were told the rest of the theater got to laughing more at us than the movie. One evening we went to the grotto at Notre Dame. We wanted to pray for our future wives whoever they would be. It wasn’t until quite a while after and when we looked back we realized that within a week of that prayer we had both met the women who would eventually become our wives. I met Kathy and Jim met Jeanie. Kathy and I got married in 1976 and Jim and Jeanie got married in 1977. Years went by and children started coming. Jim and I both passed the real estate broker exam and started working at Cressy and Everett. We even bought an investment property to fix up and resell to keep shoes on the kids and food on their plates. It was a tough time because interest rates were in the teens. We learned a very important lesson during this time involving a house listed for sale for $28500. Jim and I were prepared to offer $25000. We discussed it with my dad Clem Miller who had been a realtor for as long as I can remember. He went with us to look at the house suggested we offer them $6000. $6000? What? When we saw he wasn’t kidding we offered them $6000. They countered back to us at $7000. We bought it and we ended up making just a little bit of money for our effort. But we would have lost a huge amount without this advice. Jim moved on to work as a salesman then later asked me to join him in making some furniture to sell. He bought all kinds of woodworking machinery and then moved it into my garage. Anything to make a buck and the kids kept coming! Of course with lots of kids things happen. Jim would get to laughing about some of the things parents experience. I said to him “You mean like the time one of my kids decided he wanted to practice driving a car and he took out the basketball pole that was mounted in cement.” Jim would quote Bobby Bowden the Florida State football coach. When Bobby was asked about some of his athletes who were suspended for academics or others arrested for various reasons he would say “Yes yes that’s right. That’s true. But they’re good boys!” Jim was diagnosed with cancer on November 20 2017. Even during his chemo treatments and surgeries he never lost his sense of humor. I remember that on the day he was diagnosed Jim said he was wondering if there was golf in heaven. Someone whom I won’t mention said he heard there was good news and bad news about that. The good news is “Yes there is golf in heaven—beautiful golf.” The bad news is “You have a tee time tomorrow at 8:00.” Jim laughed so hard at that. The nurses must have wondered what was going on down there. That was Jim. The spring of 2018 came and things got busy. Jim was still employed delivering RVs across the country plus going for chemo having surgeries and squeezing in as much golf as possible. One highlight for me was riding with Jim and his good friend and head Bob Thomas to Jim’s many doctor and clinic visits. Bob and Jim have been very close for decades through all the ups and downs. I was blessed to get to know Bob better along the way. Bob and his wife Kathy were always there for Jim and Jeanie. Jim loved golf. I think we were on the course about 25 times from the end of April to early September and when Jim couldn’t really golf after his surgeries we devised a chip and putt competition. We each had three balls we could chip up towards the hole on the putting green and proceed to put one in to see who could do it with the least number of strokes.  Bruce Brand (northern Virginia) (left) and Walt Seale (Campus Indianapolis) relax for a few moments during an Action summer. I got a call from Jim on the morning of November 6 election day. He said he wanted to go vote. I couldn’t believe it but I picked him up and took him. He used his walker to get inside voted and then he had me get the wheelchair to take him out to the car. I dropped him off at home. I was going to tell him later but I forgot that after I took him to vote I went to my own polling station to vote and cancelled his vote out! I know he would have laughed at that. Jim tells the story of how when he was young he almost drowned after falling out of a boat into a frigid lake. At that time he said he was not particularly a praying man but he talked to God and God sent a boat to rescue him saving his life and the lives of his friends. I believe Jim knows more fully now how much our prayers are answered.

6776,Dec. 5 2018 10:36 a.m.,A House Fit for an Architect,Bill and Tucky Argus's new house in New Orleans. [Editor's Note:  Our brother in Christ Bill Argus passed away on November 27 2018. We're republishing this article from Summer 2010 here in his honor.] By Sean Connolly and Chris Meehan Photos: Bill Argus John Meehan and Angela Pingel The fate of the shoemaker’s children is to go barefoot the car mechanic usually drives a beater and the architect’s family . . . well they live for three decades in a cookie-cutter home with every day a frustrating tribute to just how unimaginatively walls and a roof can be arranged. Those days are finally over for the Argus family (New Orleans). After Hurricane Katrina wrecked two homes his family owned Bill Argus an architect for 43 years saw his moment to make up for all those years of “boring.” He spent two years designing a long and narrow home that is really three cottages back to back to back connected by covered walkways. They stand on a narrow strip of land—like a median—between two streets in western New Orleans on a lot that is 260 feet long but just 34 feet across at its widest point. Drivers on Catina and Wuerpel Streets sometimes slow down to gawk or park and drop in for a tour.  The combination living room and rec room features exposed rafters pine floors and windows on three sides. Years ago Bill and Tucky had both noticed the odd-shaped parcel. When they finally had their chance to build it was the only spot they could agree on. “I relished the challenge of creating a house in that space that didn’t look monolithic” Bill explains. By designing their new home as three cottages Bill avoided what would have been a very long and probably unworkable dwelling and the odd-shaped parcel became a usable spot for a home. The front cottage is for eating and sitting the middle cottage is for sleeping and the back cottage is for guests. This means that you have to walk outdoors from the bedroom to the front cottage for a morning cup of coffee but only briefly. The whole house rests five feet off the ground on piers. There are decks on three sides (an oak tree is growing through the front deck).  Bill and Tucky Bill is a firm believer in natural light and this belief determined the size and placement of the 36 windows. All the rooms have windows on at least two sides and the loft in the sleeping cottage has windows on all four sides. It’s possible—if you can spare the time—to chart the path of the sun from rising to setting through the living room windows. “It’s wonderful to sit in the living room with its 180-degree view of the sky” Tucky says. Just in case there’s another hurricane all the windowpanes are built to survive wind gusts of 130 m.p.h.  The dining room has an open and airy feel but low-hanging lamps provide a more intimate ambience during dinner. The front cottage contains a seating area a dining area with a table for 10 and a kitchen with an island. Across a 13-foot covered deck the middle cottage includes a study seating area master bedroom and laundry area on the first floor. A spiral staircase leads to a loft with four beds for guests and grandkids a bathroom and a closet. The back cottage includes a bedroom bath and kitchenette with a carport and tool shed behind it. Outside gravel paths wind through a spacious garden that is Tucky’s playground. (Their old house had little space for gardening.) Camellia bushes bloom in winter crepe myrtle blooms in the summer and there are three fruit trees (fig avocado and lemon).  A walkway between two of the three cottages that comprise the house. “Now I can set aside a place just for my fall bulbs the sweet peas and the pears” Tucky says. It might come as a surprise that Bill has designed only a few houses during his time as an architect. (He’s designed about 15 including our row of houses in Allendale.) Instead he’s focused his efforts on churches schools and other buildings for large group gatherings. Still he sees a connection between this relatively small job and his larger designs. “A church is basically a house—a home for the body of Christ” he says. “Similarly a house of committed Christians is something like a church.”  Bill used pickets on outdoor deck rails to provide privacy but still allow people in the house to see the street. His creation continues to evolve. For example he has plans to add privacy shutters to the walkways between the cottages. He also imagines adding a model railroad—a G scale miniature train with cars 30 inches long 8 inches wide and 10 inches high—running on a track that will pass through Tucky’s elaborate gardens and loop from the back of the house to the front. “It’ll add to the whimsy of the place” he says with a laugh. Tucky adds “I’ll often stand on the deck and look up and down the yard overwhelmed at the generosity of God and the talent he gave my husband. It’s a trip watching people drive by very slowly and then calling out ‘I love it.’”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6776
6765,Oct. 4 2018 10:17 a.m.,Hula-Hoops and Fried Chicken,Some Praise Academy students—Shaniya Macayla and Aurbrie—worked together during a recent reading workshop. by Chris Meehan Photo: Joan Pingel Joan Pingel sighed as she walked into the Bossier City LA shopping mall on a Saturday in July and saw the extremely long line. The mall was giving away backpacks loaded with school supplies and Joan and two chaperones had brought seven Praise Academy students with them to stand in that line. It didn’t matter that they had arrived 45 minutes early. So had everyone else! Adding to the pressure one of the students had confided in Joan that there was no food to eat in his family’s house. “We’ll talk about that later” Joan had told him hoping that an answer to his needs would materialize in the meantime. As the line snaked through the mall Joan saw that they were standing in front of Victoria’s Secret a lingerie store. She told the students to turn their backs so they wouldn’t see the store’s immodest displays. Facing in a new direction they noticed a crew of mall employees trying to organize a Hula-Hoop contest to keep the kids in the line occupied. Most of the kids hadn’t noticed what was happening but three Praise Academy students joined the competition. Two of them quickly fizzled out their hoops and their hopes clattering to the floor. But the young boy who had told Joan about his hunger hung on until he was the last man standing. He was the champ and entitled to a prize. “What do I get Miss Joan?” he asked. The prize was a $25 gift card to a fried chicken chain Raising Cane’s! “The Lord heard you asking me about food” Joan told him. The boy handed her the card for safe-keeping. “Don’t tell my mom yet” he told Joan. The line seemed to move more quickly after that. The students got their new backpacks and everyone returned to the van. When Joan took the winning student back home he excitedly told his mom about the contest. “What did you win?” she asked. He handed her the gift card triumphantly proud to have made a contribution to the family. “Look at what the Lord provided” the mom said. Later that evening Joan went to pick up a chicken dinner for the whole family.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6765
6762,Oct. 4 2018 10:10 a.m.,How Praise Academy Stole My Heart,Julie Bruber by Julie Bruber Photo: Robert Cunningham Photoresource For 25 years I’d worked as an entrepreneur saleswoman and leader in a fast-growing technology company. I’d helped build the company from the ground up but by 2017 my fire and zeal had faded. So after a lot of prayer I sold most of my shares and walked away. I felt the Lord calling me to something new but what? I spent a few months enjoying the strange newness of my new schedule but I became restless. I needed a purpose. The Lord told me to be patient. Then in January of 2018 I got an offer to work in marketing and development for Praise Academy in the Allendale/Lakeside neighborhood of Shreveport. I had some apprehensions. For starters I hadn’t done fundraising before. I knew that the students would be depending on me. Would I be able to live up to their hopes? I love kids. I always keep gum or candy in my purse to pass it out to the kids at our community meetings in Servant Branch. But would the kids in Shreveport like me? There was another problem: I’ve been part of the community since I was 18. I love our life but when it came to our mission work in the new starts I was indifferent. Sure I’d enjoyed hearing the missionary stories and some of them even moved me but for the most part they went in one ear and out the other. I’d heard other community members share about how the Lord had called them to move to the mission front and so I’d chuckle to myself and think Wow we’re losing a lot of people. We’re like a triple-A farm team constantly feeding baseball players to the big leagues! I’d never been disgruntled or resentful but I also didn’t fully rejoice with my brothers and sisters about how the Lord had moved in their hearts. I had a terrible attitude. Brothers and sisters please forgive me! As part of my discernment process I traveled to Shreveport to visit Praise Academy. When I got into town I pulled off the interstate turned left and took in the scene. I saw businesses with bars on the windows and crumbled sidewalks with grass poking up through the cracks. I saw a house with a damaged roof and weeds growing up out of it. It looked abandoned but then a man walked out of it. Were people really living in places like this? I drove across a bridge through an area that I later learned is renowned for drugs and prostitution. I felt a deep darkness in my spirit. After getting turned around a few times I finally made it onto Yale Avenue. I spotted a few very modest but well-kept houses all in a row. The contrast was striking and my spirits lifted. When I walked in the door at Praise Academy the children surrounded me. They kept hugging me and peppering me with questions. “Who are you?” “Where are you from?” “You got kids?” “How come you talk funny?” One little boy gave me a hug and as I bent over to hug him back he caught a whiff of my hairspray. “Mmm your hair smell good! What you got in your hair?” The Praise Academy kids stole my heart. It took about 30 seconds. During my visit I met a mom named Connie and her husband Aubrey. Connie had come to the very first camp the People of Praise ran in 2003 and now she and Aubrey have three children in the school. “Did you grow up in the People of Praise like Connie did?” Aubrey asked me. I was blown away by that question. She is a part of our family and we are part of hers. I hadn’t understood that before. I took a walk with David Zimmel. Neighbors kept coming up to him to say hello. He knew all their names and they knew his. I saw that this isn’t a hopeless place. There is love here. The body of Christ is here. The neighbors I met were unpretentious warm welcoming and easy to talk to. There is something very beautiful in them. They don’t abort their babies and they love their kids. My heart was moved so I prayed some more and took the job. I’ve been at it for a few months now. I work primarily from Minnesota but I get to travel to Louisiana for meetings. God has been blessing the work. Last spring we held our first local fundraiser part of a campaign called Give for Good. We finished second among all the participating nonprofit organizations in northern Louisiana raising nearly $125000. We produced a video and this fall we are expecting two newspaper stories that will get the word out about Praise Academy to more than 200000 people. We’ve launched a sponsor-a-student program to allow people to help give these kids a Christian education that can change their lives forever. The Apostle John wrote “But if anyone has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need yet closes his heart against him how does God’s love abide in him?” I may not have always felt that love in me but I have seen and I know for a fact that that love abides in us and it abides in Allendale/Lakeside. I’m a part of that love too and that’s right where I want to be.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6762
6767,Oct. 4 2018 8:48 a.m.,Whatever the Cost: Honoring Kerry Koller,Kerry Koller Photos: Vine & Branches Archives In August faculty members from all three Trinity Schools and Trinity Academy in Portland gathered in South Bend for a weeklong summit. During the summit Jon Balsbaugh the president of Trinity Schools Inc. hosted a dinner to honor his predecessor Kerry Koller (South Bend) who stepped down as president in the summer of 2017 after 36 years. (Kerry continues to serve Trinity Schools in the role of president emeritus.) Here are several excerpts from the sharings that evening. KEVIN RANAGHAN It’s been a privilege for me to know Kerry and Barbara for more than 50 years. I remember first noticing them a young married couple at Little Flower Church when Dorothy and I were dating. I wanted to know more about them. Hanging around the Cursillo crowd at Notre Dame I soon learned that Kerry a philosophy grad student was a deeply committed Catholic Christian seriously intellectual with a heart for church renewal and building God’s kingdom now. I can see now that he had already been in pursuit of the good the true and the beautiful. In so many endeavors Kerry has been on the cutting edge of what the Lord seeks today. He was an early leader in the charismatic renewal a founder of a covenant community in San Francisco and also of a leadership formation program in South Bend called the Apostolic Institute which was key both in the development of the permanent diaconate in the Catholic Church and the People of Praise ecumenical community. Later he led a large band of folks to leave San Francisco and move here to join the People of Praise. He is a courageous risk-taker in the Lord. I think it was about this time that the Lord spoke to him about Trinity School. Kerry is one of the hardest-working men I have ever known. In building Trinity and also as a leader and teacher in our community he has spared no effort over long and hard hours of research and writing and speaking to get it right and to express it clearly in a convincing way. Our offices have been next door to each other and I’ve seen this quality for many years. Whatever it costs him he has spent himself for Trinity for its goals and vision and for its achievement. TOM FINKE Kerry more than anyone has held the vision bright. He consistently held up the goal that the formation of the intellect was foremost. Memos and talks that I have from the early 1980s sound remarkably like those he sent out and gave in the middle of 2010. This theory turned into practice under his direction and the community of learners became not just a trite phrase but a reality. Another aspect of his life has been his missionary spirit. You’ve heard about him moving to South Bend from San Francisco but he has also served as head of school at each of the campuses which of course meant uprooting his family life to do so as well as adding to his already sufficiently busy job as president of Trinity Schools. Kerry has also always been a collaborator being a member of the community even as he gave direction. My best example of this occurred when in 2004 he suggested to me that he and I become a “Head of School team.” Now he could have just done this job himself. Instead for the next six years we worked as a team which required many hours of communication and trust in each other. STEPHEN KOLLER When I heard my dad was stepping down from day-to-day operations of the school I asked him whether he would want some sort of formal acknowledgment. He said “No I am part of a team. We all have different roles and parts to play and this was my part. I am no better than anyone else.” This is a window into how Dad has always viewed his place within the Trinity narrative. I reached out to my siblings and our mom for stories and they responded with many. First I want to honor you for your servant’s heart. As my brother Peter said “I remember going to Trinity on Saturdays to refresh and clean the building along with associated trips to TruValue to buy light bulbs paint and cleaning supplies.” From Jack “He would go to the copy room at Greenlawn and spend countless hours copying teacher seminar handouts and materials.” From Jack “I can still remember him buying a PC and setting it up at home to fully demo it before they were bought for the new computer lab.” There were no school IT people back then. And Mom relayed “Before his stepping down while we would be on vacation he would spend the first couple hours every day on email and working on items that needed attention.” He was a founder curriculum builder head of school president of three schools with all the associated work that comes with that. And he did that while serving on the People of Praise board of governors being a head coordinator giving a leading role in the vision of the community writing talks giving talks and providing pastoral care all while also raising a family. That’s hard work. Dad also always had the respect of his students. As Peter said “The respect he had from students in classes where he was teaching and where I was present was real and unequivocal. No one ever joked about him and they behaved themselves and often raised their game in his presence.” When I was there the school was not my favorite thing at the time but I also did not want to hear people disparage my dad or my mom because they worked there. In speaking with a friend then I thanked him for not ripping my dad around me. He said “I won’t because some people treat you like children unless you prove otherwise and your dad has always treated us like adults unless we prove otherwise.”  Kerry teaching around 1984. PAUL DECELLES I want to say a word about the role of friendship in Kerry’s life and our life. The first thing about friendship that everybody knows is that you have to be present as often as you can with the one with whom you are a friend. But sometimes friends have to be separated like Francis Xavier was separated from Ignatius for years at a crack. Francis would get a letter or two a year which he would put in a pouch around his neck to carry around. They had a sense of being present to each other across the distance. They were one. They were in sync. Several years after I ceased being overall coordinator I also stopped being the chairman of the board of Trinity Schools. And so the weekly meetings that Kerry and I had with each other up until that time which we had been doing for years these really wonderful times ceased. We both wanted to do something about that but it turns out that we hardly ever saw each other thereafter. He had new responsibilities. I had very different responsibilities and our paths didn’t cross. There were a lot of intervening life experiences that had to take precedence over our being together. But when I do run into Kerry it’s as though we hadn’t skipped a beat. We start up the conversation in exactly the same place. I don’t mean that it’s routine and automatic. It’s ratcheted up a bit. It’s improved. It’s moved on. It’s more real still alive. It is really the case that Kerry and I have one heart. And as long as we’re of one heart we’ll always be friends. Kerry has a huge capacity for being a friend of all of us. JON BALSBAUGH Kerry never sought reward honor or prestige for the school or himself. Instead he’s lived by the light of the truth and the leading of the Holy Spirit demonstrating for us all what it means to live a meaningful moral self-sacrificing life. He has borne consistent witness to education as a human awakening both for himself and for his students. Whether inspiring students with his talk on the Habitual Vision of Greatness guiding the faculty through a major adjustment to our philosophy of education that became known as the New Paradigm engaging The Matrix the sci-fi film as a metaphor for our education or simply sharing New York Times articles with those he thought would find them interesting Kerry has shown us all that one can live a life of wonder that does not cease.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6767

Then Peter Hammer the leader of this Jesus Jam suggested the group pray over John Gehl a longtime counselor who is suffering from cancer and from paralysis in his legs. The children gathered around John’s wheelchair to ask the Lord to heal him with the youngest and shortest children closest to the front and the taller children standing farther out. “It was like a wall of prayer surrounding him” Peter said. “The Lord was present.” Despite his condition John was serving as the camp’s first spiritual director and by the time of the Jesus Jam on Wednesday night the campers had had ample opportunities to experience his care and concern as he led them in prayer and told stories of God’s action in his life. “He was a truly amazing witness” said Becca Coleman (Muncie) a counselor for the eighth-grade girls. It was the 31st year of camp for Tom Shriver the longtime director. “The peace of God was so evident throughout the week.

Some learned how to paint with watercolors at tables Kathryn Kelly had set up. Others enjoyed a burlap sack race face painting and carnival games. Everyone came together to open the Lord’s Day and one neighbor enjoyed the ceremony so much she asked to take home a copy of the prayers. “We had a beautiful time . . . a wonderful three hours together” said Abe Olson who leads the Christians in Mission team. “It felt like life in the kingdom.”  As the festival was winding down Abe got word that a fight had broken out on the far corner of the block. He and two other brothers hurried over and got there as the fight was ending. He saw blood on the faces of some men who quickly got in their cars and drove off. The community men noticed a neighbor who had witnessed the fight a mother with young children. She seemed shaken so they stopped to pray and talk with her. The contrast between the festival and the fight made a strong impression on Abe. “I experienced a consolation from the Lord. Those sorts of fights were more common five years ago but not recently. If the enemy is willing to play a card like that to try to disturb the peace that God our Father is creating that means he is getting pretty desperate and concerned about what the Lord is up to.”  South Side neighbors Ruth and Esther (left) pray before snack time.

On the dewy grass a crowd of 15 gathers to help set up the weekly farmstand for Praise Harvest the community’s urban farm. After praying together the volunteers spread out to gather the harvest from the vacant lots that God and hard work have turned into teeming plots. There are purple orange and yellow carrots green peppers okra red and green tomatoes eggplant banana peppers and greens. They wash the produce and lay everything out on tables beneath a tent canopy. Neighbors pull over in their cars and holler to ask what kinds of greens are available. Bouquets of zinnias rest on a red-and-white checkered tablecloth alongside a binder filled with pictures of sheet cakes and pull-apart cupcake cakes that Abby Earhart can bake to order.

6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671
6634,June 27 2018 10:10 a.m.,The One Who Wrote Back,Camera club group photo: Cathy Grill (now Walters) LaCondra Shacarra Ciarra Eric and Gretchen Rolland (now Connolly). by Sean Connolly Photos: Gretchen Connolly It was a Sunday morning this April just after church when I checked my email and found this letter:Hello there. My name is Ciarra and I was just up early this morning and decided to google the people of praise because I remembered them from my youth. About ten or eleven years ago I lived in Shreveport Louisiana where I was pretty much a miserable poverty stricken teen with no family there outside of my father step mother and little brother. I lived a hard life there in the Allendale neighborhood. One day when I was at a friends house a group of people walked up and invited us to come to a camp that was starting in a few weeks. We didn’t say much to them at the time because number one they were strangers and number two we really didn’t know how to take it. Here is this bold group of people just as happy as can be marching around in this mean old neighborhood without a fear or worry! That intrigued us. We ended up going to the camp and it was the start of a great journey. We did EVERYTHING with them! We woke up early just to go over there and play with their toys. I joined a film club with a woman named Genevieve and had the time of my life with a disposable camera. They started making dinner at night and inviting the neighbors and even started making breakfast and inviting us to that as well. Sometimes it was the only way we were able to eat. One sad day about a year after meeting these people me and my little brother were forced to live in a homeless shelter with our stepmom by the state because we had toooons of dogs. The people of praise WITHOUT HESITATION helped my father clean and remodel that house for us to come home. They even built dog houses so that our dogs no longer had to share beds with us! We were able to come home 3 weeks later. May 3rd 2008 was my last day in Louisiana. My mom from OHIO came and moved us away to have a better living environment. We spent that morning eating breakfast and praying with the people of praise. I am writing this letter to say that the People of Praise made a huge impact on the lives of me and my brother and if there was any way possible that I could reconnect with Genevieve and Nathan and the Allendale group that would mean a lot to me! Thank you very much for your time.I knew exactly who Ciarra was. Her story—the story of two children living in a house with floors caked with dog poop–had become something of a legend in our missionary circles. To my knowledge no one had heard from Ciarra since her family left Allendale in 2008. Now here she was ten years later telling us what we had meant to her. With awe and gratitude I sent her letter on to Nathan and Genevieve Barrett and a few others and read it aloud to my wife Gretchen who had lived in Allendale during that period and started the camera club Ciarra mentioned. Ciarra’s story goes back to February of 2007 when her little brother Eric came to find Nathan. Child welfare authorities had come to their house and decided that the children could no longer live there because of the filthy conditions. (There were eight or ten pit bulls living in the house and defecating everywhere.) Ciarra and Eric wound up going to live in a Salvation Army shelter while Nathan contacted the father and offered to help clean the house. “The whole house was like a toilet” Nathan recalls. Working in the dark since the house had no electricity Nathan and Rus Lyons removed furniture ripped out the carpet and cleaned the floors. As he chipped away at the encrusted dog droppings with a paint scraper Nathan fumed with anger. Then as he recalls “All of a sudden Rus started singing one of the songs from the songbook. I started singing too. That was a beautiful moment.” That weekend Genevieve had traveled to Shreveport from Minnesota to visit Nathan. They were dating seriously but not yet engaged and time together was precious. But their plans changed as Nathan dedicated much of his time to working at the house. Later Genevieve herself got the chance to clean working with Joan Pingel with rubber gloves and Lysol to disinfect every surface—the perfect preparation for a missionary marriage! Nathan and crew hauled the old furniture to the dump and lent a few items to the family who also bought a few furniture pieces. They built several dog houses in the backyard. Later the child welfare authorities came to inspect the house they deemed it safe for habitation and the children returned. The children’s father threw a barbecue for the whole missionary team to say thank you. Just over a year later in the spring of 2008 Ciarra and Eric left Allendale for good and that was our last contact with them until Ciarra sent her letter.  Camera club members Eric Ciarra Shacarra and Cathy Grill (now Walters) observed some fish in the R.W. Norton Art Gallery gardens in April 2007. I replied quickly to her message and received a second email just as beautiful and then we arranged a time to talk on the phone. She told me that she very much wants others to know her story and she filled me in on some of the background. Ciarra and Eric had come to Allendale from Florida with their dad in 2005 when she was 12. Their lease in Florida had run out and a friend in Shreveport had found them a house there. When they arrived they didn’t know anyone in the city aside from that friend who soon moved away. Ciarra remembers getting in lots of fights during their first weeks in the neighborhood. That summer she attended our summer camp and she has good memories of beating out drum rhythms on overturned paint buckets learning a praise dance with some of the other girls and some of our praise songs. At home things were changing for Ciarra and Eric. “When we first moved there . . . I saw a complete change in my dad. I was used to him being an outgoing bubbly friendly person but a couple of months after we got to [Louisiana] he just became like a hermit never left the house. If he needed something from the store he would send us. He didn’t work. . . . I ended up finding later on that my dad had gotten on drugs really bad.” The drugs brought financial difficulties. The city cut off water to the house and they spent a year living without electricity. “We lived across the street from a baseball stadium. [My dad] made us wake up at 4:00 a.m. We had this big storage tote and he would make us fill it up with water at the stadium and wheel it all the way home. It was so heavy we used to cry. . . . “To cook we had to walk around the neighborhood and collect sticks. To make a pack of Ramen noodles we had to cook it on the grill. It was just an awful awful situation.” The children ate at school and at an after-school feeding program sponsored by Mt. Sinai Church and sometimes at the community’s houses on Yale Avenue. They had arrived in the neighborhood with only two dogs but the dogs kept having puppies. “I felt like living in my house I was a slave. My dad was a slave to the dogs. I had to cook for my little brother. I had to clean for my little brother. I would have to cook chicken for the dogs and we couldn’t eat until his dogs ate.” She added “We just didn’t have a childhood. Our only sense of being a child was when we were at the People of Praise.” During this period Ciarra did not have much contact with her mother in Ohio. When she did talk with her “My dad would make us talk on speakerphone to make sure we didn’t tell her that we were having a rough time.” But her dad allowed her to go to the public library and there Ciarra created a Myspace page and used it to get in touch with her mom telling her the truth about their situation. Her mom called and told Ciarra’s dad that she would be coming for a visit and arrived a couple of weeks later. Ciarra remembers filling a pillowcase with her clothes and her brother’s clothes and telling just a few of her friends that she would be leaving for good. Her mom picked up Ciarra and Eric from the community’s houses on Yale Avenue and then went to tell Ciarra’s dad that they would be leaving. “That was the last time I saw my dad for maybe four years” Ciarra said. Ciarra had engineered her own rescue. Today she lives in the Toledo Ohio area with her two small children and their father and works at a license branch. She told me she was thinking about homeschooling her kids and we chatted about that since Gretchen has been teaching our own kids. I told her that our summer camps in Allendale are still going strong and I told her all about Praise Academy and how the school serves children from extremely difficult backgrounds like hers. She asked me for pictures of the camps and school and said that she would like to go back to see the progress in the neighborhood. “But on the other hand it was so painful. I don’t know when I’ll be able to go back and have the courage to face it. “I could tell that story a thousand times” Ciarra says. “God showed me that when I thought I didn’t have anybody he sent an army to swarm around us and smother us in love love we weren’t getting at home and didn’t get anywhere else.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6634
6632,June 27 2018 10:09 a.m.,An Urban Resurrection,Kelly Park has been completely rebuilt through the efforts of neighborhood children and adults and will be formally dedicated this summer. by Elizabeth Grams Photos: Margaret Anderson; courtesy of Beth Sanford For Lu Ella Webster a lifelong resident of South Bend’s northeast neighborhood Kelly Park is a place of happy memories. She can recall playing with other children black and white together on the domed monkey bars and pump merry-go-round back in the 1950s when the park was new. But in more recent years she says the park became run-down. Some neighbors would warn children not to play there. There were hypodermic needles on the ground and cars speeding close to the remaining playground equipment made it dangerous for little ones. The park’s one bench had broken slats. Its swingset and basketball hoops were faded and worn. Today the park has been rebuilt from the ground up with two basketball half-courts a pavilion a perimeter fence new playground equipment and dozens of beautiful trees. This summer South Bend city representatives will gather with neighbors and friends to cut the ribbon across the park’s brand new entrance and officially dedicate it. The seeds of the park’s resurrection lay in the dreams of a group of neighborhood children. With the help of many others moved by those dreams Beth Sanford (South Bend) and her friend and neighbor Lu Ella turned them into a reality. They raised $220000 in donations and pushed the reconstruction forward from start to finish. Matt and Beth Sanford and their children live half a block away from Kelly Park. They’ve watched their neighborhood change in recent years as new houses were built attracting families connected with the University of Notre Dame located just to the north. Wealthier households moved in next to or replaced middle or lower-income families. Kelly Park remained uninviting and unsafe until some neighborhood children voiced a desire to change it.  These eight-to-twelve-year-olds from the nearby Robinson Community Learning Center initiated the renovation of Kelly Park and raised the first $6000 in grant money. The children were attending a program at Robinson Community Learning Center a Notre Dame-sponsored outreach to the neighborhood. After taking a closer look at their neighborhood through the program they told their leader Lu Ella that if they could improve one thing about their neighborhood it would be Kelly Park. In 2013 the group of a dozen eight-to-twelve-year-olds made a small grant proposal for park renovations that was approved. Lu Ella still lives on the property where she was born and raised directly across the street from Kelly Park. She says her family—she’s one of 15 children—were the first African-Americans to move into the neighborhood. She has been a leader in neighborhood projects and helped the children develop and publicize their hopes for the park. In 2013 Beth was a stay-at-home mother of five and also an architect by training. With her children in school she was starting to feel a creative itch. She asked the Lord about it and decided she should offer to help Lu Ella. She had no idea that she had just gotten herself into a five-year project.  Beth Lu Ella and neighborhood boys joined Fr. Ed Silvia C.S.C. as he recently blessed the park. “The first thing we did was to have a design charrette with the kids” Beth says. “We worked with them to draw pictures of what they wanted. They wanted a basketball court a walking path for parents to exercise while their children play a gated playground a place that was handicapped-accessible. They wanted benches for adults and elderly people a pavilion and grill. What they wanted was not just for themselves but for the community. I was really inspired.” Beth and Lu Ella and their team took the design proposals to the city’s parks department. “They told us ‘That’s great! We don’t have any money.’ So we said ‘Neither do we! Okay we’ll raise it.’” Beth and Lu Ella started pounding the pavement. They quickly secured a $10000 donation from a neighborhood revitalization association. They approached their neighbors around the corner the owners of a local business who wrote out a check for $7500 on the spot. Encouraged they kept going eventually securing tens of thousands of dollars towards the renovation.  One iteration of Beth’s landscape plans. Beth worked with vendors cutting costs and asking for discounts on materials and labor. She found out that Indiana masonry workers had an apprenticeship program and asked if they could build the entrance piers for free. “I brought this really architecturally pretty drawing of the piers and the guy in charge said “That’s great but I can’t build that”—because they’re just first-year apprentices. And I said ‘Oh! Well what can you build?’ So we sat and modified the drawing.” She worked with neighborhood children and youth groups to help clean up trash in the park. She spoke with neighbors about what was going on in the park and asked for their input and she and Lu Ella kept in touch with city officials. They made sure to express their thanks to everyone involved. “Lu Ella and I fed the masons a full meal and they said ‘Wow we always just get cold pizza!’” Beth had plenty to learn since her background had been mainly in commercial residential and light industrial architecture. “As an architect I’m a research junkie” she says. “I started contacting my friends who are landscape architects to get their opinions. I called the manufacturers of the swingset: ‘this is how I’m interpreting your safety standards. Is this correct?’ I found out how expensive playground equipment is about the requirements for loose-fill barriers about surface materials and their compaction rates. Even things like where to put the grills and trash cans—you have to think about it from the city’s maintenance standpoint. I felt like it was God’s gift to me that I got to do this.”  Beth utilized all the volunteer manpower she could find like these apprentice bricklayers to help with the renovation. Beth’s son James saw kids playing on the new courts even before the paint was down. “The courts are definitely very well used. With two separate courts now you can have a playful game with grade school kids and a real scrimmage with some high schoolers. I think that was really smart.” At the Sanford house family mealtime conversations often came back to the park. Matt works as a machinist in the Notre Dame Department of Physics shop which donated scrap metals to the local blacksmiths’ guild where the men designed and built the new entrance sign for the park and a sculptural bike rack designed like a carousel. Matt himself engraved the plaques on each of the park benches with the names of donors. James brought fellow Trinity classmates out to help paint the new fencing. “Our family unit has grown in patience and support” Matt says. “We pray for Beth’s work at the park and we’re proud. The Lord has guided her.” After working together so long Beth and Lu Ella call one another sisters and their families have become close. “When something goes wrong we text each other: ‘Remember the Lord is in it.’ Every step of the way we said ‘Lord lead us to the people you want to lead us to and to the people you want me to ask for money.’”  Beth got involved in all aspects of the project even forging part of the sculptural bike rack. This year workers planted 26 boxwoods and 116 trees including 83 arborvitaes that created a green screen around two sides of the park. Recently Beth noticed that someone had been stealing some of the shrubs. As she was thinking about what to do she saw a woman walk into the park with a wagon and some dirt looking like she was about to take off with another shrub. Beth started to pray and got the sense that instead of confronting the woman she should listen to her. The woman began talking about how Notre Dame had paid for all the plants and how she and some friends were going to come over and fertilize them. Beth explained to her that she and others had raised the money to renovate the park showing her pictures of the renovation. While they were talking a group of boys rode up on their bikes and Beth invited them to help water the plants. Soon the woman was helping to clean up around the plants and the boys started to help her. “God bless you” the woman said to Beth. “You’re good with these boys.” She left promising to come back and help again. “Beth and Lu have been great partners” says John Martinez Director of Facilities and Grounds for South Bend’s parks department which honored the two women as volunteers of the year in spring 2018. (They even got to throw out the first pitch for a South Bend Cubs minor league baseball game.) “This has been well-received by the whole neighborhood” said John. “I wish we had more neighborhood groups like them.” “It’s a good feeling” Lu Ella says seeing the fruit of their labors every day from her home. “One day there must have been a hundred kids over here in the park and what a blessing to hear the laughter! And the Notre Dame law students had their family picnic over here. We had a man whose wife passed and they wanted to have a celebration for her and all the family were saying let’s do it at Perley Park and he said ‘No she grew up across the street. This is the park she played in.’ They had it here in the park. And then they did fireworks later on at night and it was beautiful.”  Neighborhood children make good use of the park’s new playground equipment. Now Beth sees neighborhood families rich and poor alike playing alongside one another in the new park. “For me learning how to build a park is one thing but now I can see the social impact and I know how God has had his hand in it . . . you have all the expensive new homes coming in next to all the older homes that have middle to lower-income families. Before the new families would not even come to this park. Now you’re starting to see the neighborhood coming together. It’s like a place of union.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6632
6601,May 16 2018 9:21 p.m.,Action Conference 2018: A Shot Through the Heart,Morning sessions included general talks and discussion. Photos: Collin Anderson Becca Joy Root Amy Root The 2018 Action conference aimed to address as one participant put it “universal questions that all teens have been asking themselves”—questions about friendship God and how to take effective action during the school year.  On Saturday afternoon each discussion group created a poster to help themselves grasp and remember major themes of the conference: growing in friendship with one another and the Lord and taking responsibility for concrete steps to answer the Lord’s call on their lives. The conference held April 4-7 brought together 137 students and 59 adults at the South Bend branch center. It was designed to tackle tough issues the high school students themselves had raised during last summer’s Action trips. In his opening talk Program Coordinator Mike Wacker summarized what the students had said: “We want to be friends but don’t experience friendship much. We want to grow in love of God but the circumstances of everyday life control us and squeeze God out. We feel stuck.” The conference’s talks discussion groups prayer times and practical workshops aimed to help the students get unstuck addressing topics such as friendship self-control determination the Good News praying through the Bible fixing relationships scheduling making college decisions and maintaining faith in college and the ultimate key to effectiveness the Holy Spirit. Was the conference effective? In many ways the jury is still out—”every tree is known by its own fruit” as Jesus put it. But in a sharing at a branch meeting in South Bend junior Sean Pingel expressed optimism: “The conference . . . gave us specific direction in how to do what we wanted to do for God. . . . We experienced the Lord’s forgiveness his joy and his power. As groups and individuals we recommited ourselves to live for the Lord and with him.”  Saturday evening closed out the conference with a prayer meeting.  A workshop on reading the Bible led by Nick Holovaty (Mission Evansville).  Participants squeezed in time for basketball volleyball and ga-ga ball whenever they could.  Workshops such as this one on the Gifts of the Spirit led by Chris Vieck (Mission Evansville) were held in the afternoons on Thursday and Friday.  Afternoons included reports from Action and mission efforts around the country.  Friday evening featured swing dancing.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6601
6582,May 16 2018 8:01 p.m.,Welcome to the West Side,Matt and Mary Brickweg host morning prayer twice a week. From left: JT McManmon Geriann Raway Chris Raway Matt Brickweg Jim Bulger Beth Bulger Mary Brickweg and her daughters. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Robert Cunningham Photoresource; Chris Raway; JT Mcmanmon The West Side of St. Paul is a neighborhood of contrasts. It’s the sort of place where you’ll find grand Victorian-era homes with their arched brick balconies close to tired-looking slum apartment buildings with fleece blankets covering the windows. On summer Saturdays a farmer’s market pops up in the parking lot of a former Dairy Queen now called the Icy Cup which sells tacos in addition to sweet treats. The whole neighborhood slopes down a hill from south to north ending abruptly in a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River with downtown St. Paul in all its glory visible on the opposite bank. Knocking on doors at random you’re just as likely to meet a Mexican grandmother and her teenage granddaughter a family of Muslim immigrants from Africa a white woman smoking in Tweety-bird slippers or a college-educated couple in their first home. Ask locals where they live and they won’t say “St. Paul.” Welcome to the West Side a place where community members have been deliberately clustering and reaching out since the fall of 2014. Today the initial West Side outreach team consists of Mary Bredenberg Matt and Mary Brickweg Jim and Beth Bulger Tony Kuplic JT McManmon Chris and Geriann Raway and Pat Murphy who heads the outreach. (A second outreach team is in its early stages—see below.) The first team meets weekly for a meal where they plan and share the fruit of their activities. They join together for prayer early on Tuesday and Thursday mornings at the Brickwegs’ house where Madeleine 4 and Vera 2 act as joyous ringleaders dancing about and clapping along to the guitar. They see one another often. The Brickwegs and Raways live next door to each other on Winifred Street the Bulgers live two houses down and JT McManmon lives one street over.  The Brickwegs’ house (left) is next door to the Raways’. “The common life that the team members are living together is thick” Pat says. “There is a lot of time that people are spending together. The team members are becoming fast friends and their life together may be the biggest thing happening in our West Side work right now.” Long-term he says they hope that the life they’re building will attract neighbors. In small ways that attraction is already setting in.***In the summer of 2017 many community members came together to put on a day camp in a local park for neighborhood children. Through the camp they met several local families most of them originally from Mexico and some new relationships began to blossom. At a cookout on the evening of the last day of camp Mary Brickweg met an expectant mother and offered to make a meal for her family when the baby came. A few weeks later Mary was making plans for the meal and called the mother to work out the logistics. “I asked her how many people to cook for and she rattled off her family and then she said ‘Oh and your family of course too.’” When the day came Mary helped set the table and a grandfather gave Matt a tour of improvements he’d made to the house. “It felt like we were just waltzing into the home of a family we’d known forever” Mary says.  A view of downtown St. Paul from Prospect Park near branch members’ homes. Another new friendship began when Maricruz Hernandez brought her two grade-school-age boys to the camp and realized she’d seen Beth at church. Beth offered to babysit and stunned Maricruz when she came to pick the boys up by declining an offer of payment. Maricruz remembers “She said ‘Think of it as if a grandma was babysitting. That felt really nice because my mom is not here. Even my aunts charge me for babysitting.” At the time Maricruz and her husband Francisco had been living in an apartment building whose front steps attracted a wandering group of teenagers smoking and drinking. One day last fall Maricruz called Beth to ask if the West Side team could come pray with one of her sons who was sick. Beth Jim and Chris arrived first and had to walk through a crowd of about 15 on the porch. “Tensions among the youth were escalating” Beth recalls. As the three of them stood in a small foyer waiting for JT to arrive Chris urged them to pray and they began to pray deliverance prayers in full view of the crowd on the porch. “Pretty soon after that we noticed that this crowd of kids was gone” Chris said. After that the group stayed away according to Maricruz. A few weeks later Maricruz and Francisco learned that their rent was going up so they started to think about moving. The rental house next to Matt and Mary was vacant left in poor condition by former residents. Maricruz was convinced they wouldn’t be able to afford to rent a house but decided to look anyway. The owner was reluctant to rent the house again because it was in such bad shape but when they toured the house they struck a bargain that involved Francisco working to improve the house in exchange for a reduction in rent. Over the last few weeks of December the Raways and Bulgers and their adult children visiting over the holidays put in many hours helping Francisco and Maricruz get the house ready. They cleaned the house from top to bottom refinished floors and painted. “I have never felt God’s love that much” Maricruz says.  Dinner before the team meeting at the Brickwegs’ includes a few guests. The friendship between Francisco and Maricruz’s family and the team members continues to grow and now includes a regular outreach men’s group meeting and women’s group meetings not to mention Spanish practice. Since fall the Raways and Beth have been taking classes believing that God may want them to get to know many more Spanish speakers in the area.***John Ostby dates his decision to move to the West Side to a branch men’s retreat in the spring of 2016. Nick Holovaty (Mission Evansville) led the retreat and at one point he asked the men to take five minutes in silent prayer and ask the Lord for a word for someone in their men’s group. After the prayer Bruce Olson came up and tapped John on the shoulder. He reminded John of a story from the Gospels in which Jesus tells his disciples to throw their nets on the other side of the boat. As John tells it Bruce said “I believe that’s a word for you and Sandy and I believe it’s also a word for Charlene and me.” John answered “I believe you’re right and I believe that means the West Side. We’re gonna go fish for God on the West Side.” Last summer after some months of prayer and discernment and after selling their suburban homes the Ostbys and Olsons moved to rental apartments on the West Side but they hoped to find houses to buy. One day Charlene took a walk and stopped to pray in front of a house she liked. A man stopped his car and asked what she was doing. Charlene explained that she walked the neighborhood each day to pray for a house. The man paused a moment then said “You know what God’s gonna get you a house and it’s gonna be better than you can imagine.” Then he got back in his car and left. A few months later they came across a large four-bedroom house across the street and around the corner from 490 the former convent on the grounds of St. Matthew’s Parish where Servant Branch college students and community members have been renting apartments since 2016. The house has two bedrooms upstairs and two bedrooms on the first floor with a full bath on each floor and it dawned on them that the two couples could live there together. They plan to move in this May. Together the Olsons and Ostbys are the backbone of a second outreach team which they hope will grow. Their team has a different geographical focus centered on the area around 490 about five blocks away from the cluster where the Bulgers Raways and Brickwegs live.***  A fence in the Icy Cup parking lot emblazoned with local pride. Another prong of the outreach is growing at Cerenity Senior Care a home for seniors which is also close to the 490 apartments. After talking with the chaplain about what might be helpful and trying a few ideas Beth Geriann and Meg Ferber ended up starting a small group called Women in Faith that resembles a women’s group. Geriann explains “We generally share a Scripture passage and are trying to elicit friendship among them particularly in sharing their struggles and praying for one another.” Some of the residents who attend the group are in their 90s or over 100 and others are younger but live at Cerenity for help with various health needs. Beth recalls a birthday celebration in the small group: “One of the women always knows who’s been the hospital who needs to be cheered up or who has a relative in trouble. We found out that it was going to be her birthday so we honored her and we brought her favorite food. We knew she liked music so we brought a guitar that day. She normally is giving a lot of love and sometimes experiences loneliness herself. She was very touched.” Pat says that they hope to start a men’s group at Cerenity in the near future. “There are a lot of people in that nursing home and we might end up having a big impact on them at the last stages of their lives.”***As they go about their days all the community members living on the West Side seek to interact with neighbors paying attention to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and responding in a harmonious way. That might mean walking for a few blocks with an older woman who gets off the bus with three or four bags and needs a little help carrying them. It might mean buying a meal for a homeless man and using the time to talk about the Lord or inviting a married couple over for an impromptu meal and praying with them afterward. As Pat puts it it means always being open to the Lord always asking “What do we see God doing? What’s right in front of us and how can we respond to the things we run into?”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6582
6595,May 16 2018 8:01 p.m.,Walking Miracles,Tom Shriver paused at a statue of a tired pilgrim in the Plaza San Marcos in Leon Spain during his first hike on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route in 2014. He hopes to redo the 500-mile trip from Saint-Jean-Pied-De-Port France to Santiago de Compostela when he retires. Photo: Courtesy of Tom Shriver Editor’s note: During the prayer meeting at the end of the Leaders’ Conference for Men in March Tom Shriver (Buffalo) shared the story of his healing from cancer a story many in the room had never heard. The bottom line: Tom is a walking miracle. That got us thinking. How many more healing stories are there? How many more miracle men and women are walking in our midst? Here are two such stories but we invite you to send us more. If you’ve experienced a dramatic healing please let us know and we will consider your story for a future issue. Live Man Walking by Tom Shriver Shortly before Christmas 1993 I began to experience some persistent lower-back pain. My doctor started me on a series of tests and evaluations: C-T scan sonogram blood work urinalysis X-rays and MRI. I was seen by urologists gastroenterologists neurologists neurosurgeons and even a chiropractor. Nothing turned up wrong and my doctor dismissed the ever-increasing pain as stress-related. Gradually the pain became so severe that I could not lie prone to sleep. Eventually I was unable to drive or work and walking was becoming difficult. Then my bowels and bladder shut down. Members of the branch here in Buffalo came to the house regularly and laid hands upon me praying the healing psalms from the Bible inserting my name. My favorite which I clung to throughout this ordeal was Psalm 118:17 “Tom shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord.” On February 23 1994 I returned home from a doctor’s visit and within an hour I was paralyzed from the waist down. My doctors were notified and I was rushed to Sisters of Charity Hospital in Buffalo. I was sent for a myelogram and another C-T scan. When the tests were complete my neurosurgeon told me that something was pressing on my spinal cord. I was prepped immediately for emergency surgery. Prayer groups and churches family and friends strangers and community members prayed in earnest for God’s will to be done. I cannot deny that my relationship with the Lord Jesus coupled with the power of prayer from God’s people was the reason I was so confident and able to hear the bad news from the doctors when I awoke from surgery the next morning. The surgeon had removed a tumor that was pressing on my spinal cord and causing the paralysis. He expected the paralysis to be temporary but I would have to learn to walk again and it might take three years to recover full use of my legs. The tumor was malignant and he said there were probably more (there were). I remained calm and confident; I was so grateful to be finally out of pain. I knew that God put me flat on my back for some purpose which I was unaware of right then but which he would reveal on his own schedule. The next few months included recovery radiation physical and occupational therapy the development of blood clots in my leg lots of good food and fellowship massive chemotherapy and three days of extensive radiation leading up to a bone marrow transplant in early June. About three weeks after the transplant I developed bleeding around the brain which required immediate surgery. Doctors were not sure if I could live through it in my weakened condition. The night of my surgery my wife Theresa informed Bud Northway Buffalo’s principal branch coordinator at the time of the urgent need for prayer. Bud was attending the leaders’ conference in South Bend where 200 men lifted me up to the Lord in prayer. A miracle happened: I came through surgery with flying colors. In the morning I was up walking around the halls having tea with the nurses mostly unaware of the wonder God had performed. My doctor was so surprised to see my instant recovery that he labeled me “The Miracle Man!” God had heard and responded to the prayers of his people. Slowly but steadily my physical strength and endurance returned. One doctor told me: “After all you’ve been through the progress I see in so little time is nothing short of a miracle.” Only a month after I was released from the transplant hospital I was off all antirejection medications. Today 24 years after the transplant I am still cancer-free. Glory to God! In those 24 years God has given me much to be thankful for. I was able to see each of my five children grow into wonderful adults get married and bless us with 14 grandchildren so far. Theresa and I continue to grow closer in our marriage and our walk with the Lord through several Marriage in Christ seminars we have given together. The Lord has provided me with two teaching jobs working with high school students who have special needs. In the Buffalo branch I serve as the principal branch coordinator a position I have held for more than 13 years. I love this job as much as my teaching job. I along with my wife and a few others have shared leadership of Buffalo Camp for more than 30 years drawing many of our community children into closer relationships with the Lord. I am also very grateful for the opportunity to have walked the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route in Spain twice in the past three years. I hope to be able to walk it at least one more time after I retire. These pilgrimages have given me tremendous moments of closeness to the Lord as well as great struggles—times when I learned to lean on him and nothing else. So the story continues. On a warm June evening 24 years ago the Lord of the universe heard the prayers of his people and reached down and touched this simple man beginning a chain reaction of events that blessed hundreds maybe thousands of people since that night. I am humbled yet grateful that God chose me to be the object of so much blessing. A Leg Lengthened by Anne Osterhouse I didn’t grow up in the community but in the spring of 2001 I went on a People of Praise retreat for ninth- and tenth-grade girls along with other members of my class at Trinity School at Greenlawn. On Saturday afternoon we spent quite a bit of time in personal prayer and then had the opportunity to pray with one another in small groups. I was raised Catholic but I had never experienced charismatic prayer before and this was the first time I had ever prayed with anyone. Although I’d heard of miracles and believed in them theoretically I had always been fairly cynical when I heard of them actually occurring. Yet that afternoon as we were preparing to pray together a thought entered my head: “pray for your leg.” I knew exactly what that meant. You wouldn’t have noticed it by looking at me but my right leg was seven millimeters shorter than my left leg. Also I only had half of a vertebra at one point in my back which threw things farther out of alignment. These two things meant that my spine wasn’t even so the ligaments in my back were stretched out. I had to wear a lift in my shoe—a small piece of rubber—to make my legs function as if they were the same length and get some injections near my spine to strengthen the stretched ligaments. Though I had only known about it for a couple of years I had had this problem my entire life and I expected to have it for the rest of my life. When that thought entered my head I knew with absolutely no doubt that God would heal me. It was the most certain I have ever felt about anything before or since. In our small group I asked to be prayed with in a very vague way. I said something along the lines of “I have some back problems.” I experienced no sensation whatsoever while being prayed with but as soon as I had been prayed with I knew with absolute certainty that I had been healed that my legs were the same length and that the half-vertebra was whole. Coming home that evening I kept my lift in my shoe but it didn’t feel right. When I got home I went straight to my room shut the door and stood in front of the mirror. If you look when you put your feet together your ankle bones should line up and touch in the middle. Mine never had and my shoulders had never been even. When I looked in the mirror that night my ankle bones lined up perfectly and my shoulders were exactly the same height. Now more than 17 years later they still do and still are. I have never worn my lift again and have never had another problem with these things since. Praise God!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6595

6605,May 3 2018 4:32 p.m.,Furniture Shop Opens in Indianapolis,Rus Lyons in front of the new location of The Custom Cottage on the South Side of Indianapolis. Photo by Patricia Olson. By Sean Connolly This week Rus Lyons launched the third location of The Custom Cottage on the South Side of Indianapolis.  The new business will build hand-crafted hardwood furniture including beds tables dressers and desks. It has a twofold mission: creating custom-designed furniture for customers and providing jobs for hard-to-employ neighbors. It’s motto: building lives by building furniture. “The furniture we make is solid wood and heirloom quality at an affordable price” Rus says. “Our furniture while sturdy and attractive also reflects some of the history of the wood and of the workers so that each piece tells a story of redemption.” On April 30 the Indianapolis city council certified a zoning change that allows The Custom Cottage to conduct artisan manufacturing at a 7200-square-foot building on Meridian Street clearing the final hurdle needed for the business to open.  A table built by the Custom Cottage. Rus is currently accepting furniture orders and says he's looking forward to hiring his first local employee which he expects to do as soon as he has an eight-week backlog of orders. (Photos of Custom Cottage furniture are available at www.customcottage.org.) He says he’s excited as he thinks about spending his days working alongside brothers and sisters and being part of God’s plan to provide meaningful work and gainful employment in the South Side. The opening of the business marks the culmination of a two-year training period for Rus. In May 2016 he left Evansville where he had served for six years as a missionary and moved to Grand Rapids MI then later to Milwaukee WI cities where the Custom Cottage already has locations. He learned the craft of building furniture and had responsibility for day-to-day business operations training under Coleman Moore a former pastor and church planter who started The Custom Cottage in 2012.  “Rus is definitely ready” Coleman says adding that in addition to his skills as a builder Rus has the most important attributes he will need “a great faith a deep desire to share that faith with other people and a compassionate heart. He really cares about the burdens of other people and wants to carry those burdens.”  Coleman is a partner in the Indianapolis venture but he expects to hand over full ownership of that location to Rus in the coming year. He says he likes the fact that the new business will be part of the People of Praise's broader vision of transformation and redemption for the South Side neighborhood. The location of the business is strategic in two ways. Meridian Street is a heavily trafficked thoroughfare that runs through the center of downtown Indianapolis which is about a mile away. The building is also on the southwest corner of the block which is the heart of our South Side new start. That block is already home to 33 community members (children included) as well as to Cornerstone Commons a collection of 18 apartments that are available as short-term rentals through the Airbnb web site.  Abe Olson the mission coordinator responsible for the South Side new start notes some of the advantages of the new business. “We’ll be able to have close interaction with the neighbors who work for Rus as well as having a permanent place on our target block that is open to the public. Customers will be able to learn more about all that God is doing on the South Side.”  The Custom Cottage Indianapolis can be reached at 317-426-6068 or via Facebook.

6552,May 1 2018 2:48 p.m.,This Is Not a Drill!,It took authorities 38 minutes to get the word out that the alert was a mistake. by Chris Meehan Photos: Cory Lum Courtesy of Yvonne Silva Alana Busekrus What would you do if you got a message on your phone saying that you and everyone around you might have just 12 minutes left? That’s what happened at 8:07 Saturday morning January 13 when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HIEMA) sent out a statewide alert declaring that North Korea had fired nuclear missiles at Hawaii a message that meant they could have as few as 12 minutes before disaster struck. As it happened branch members learned 38 minutes later that the alert was a false alarm but in the meantime . . . “The alert sure sent my adrenaline soaring!” says Joan Hiel who was already out at a car repair shop. “I called mydaughters told them I loved them and made sure they were in our underground cement bunker. If this was real I knew I was probably going to die so I just thanked the Lord for my life family and friends. I figured I was a winner either way: alive for Christ here or with him in heaven.” Her daughter Maria was back at home. “The moment the alarm popped up my sister and I stopped washing dishes and ran. It occurred to me that Jesus said ‘Where two or three gather in my name’ so we raised our arms and called for God’s protection.” When Joan got home two hours later they hugged and swapped stories. “We put on some music and danced like Miriam after their salvation at the Red Sea!”  Octavia Young Bev Linczer and Yvonne Silva enjoy their women’s group. Whit Au a previous principal branch coordinator was having breakfast and his wife Dorothy was still asleep when the alert came. In his mind it was an obvious false alarm. He didn’t even bother to wake Dorothy. “I didn’t take it seriously. It takes a very sophisticated guidance and control system for a ballistic missile—moving faster than a bullet—to impact as required within a mile of its target plus you need systems to set the bomb off at the right altitude etc. Nothing I’ve heard indicates North Korea is capable of that yet. Besides if it really was a full-out nuclear attack nothing meaningful could be done at that point.” Harlan and Julie Klein were on their deck drinking coffee discussing plans for the weekend when they heard the alarm go off on their phones. Thinking it was perhaps a flash flood warning they finished their coffee wasting five precious minutes. When Harlan checked his phone he could hardly believe it: Not a drill? Julie says “We were perplexed. No sirens were wailing but we responded as if it were real. We woke the kids and calmly sent them to the only room without windows.” Julie spread out a blanket and they sat on the floor. “We held hands prayed for God’s protection and waited. I looked into the faces in front of me thinking that everything was about to change. We were all very very calm.”  Don and Alana Busekrus’s well-stocked disaster cart. Don and Alana Busekrus were busy organizing the day for their family. Alana was in the kitchen with their daughter Kady home from college. “Kady’s cell pinged and she said in a serious calm voice ‘Mom. The missile alert. It’s headed to Hawaii.’ My first thought was why aren’t the sirens going off? I called 911 tried to get websites and local news. Everything was overloaded. Maybe the sirens were faulty. I decided we’d better act on the alert. “Donald and I—surprisingly calmly—woke up our two teenage daughters. We had talked about how to respond so they knew to grab essentials and head to our shelter spot.” Two years earlier Alana had taken a course in disaster nursing that assigned her to make up a disaster plan for her family. “We have a disaster cart with food and supplies to last us two weeks” she says. Once gathered they began to pray. Alana recalls “We kept thanking God that we were all together able to have had a blessed life. The biggest takeaway was how peaceful and calm we all were in the face of possible disaster even death.” Bev Linczer was over at Yvonne Silva’s for women’s group. “We were talking when the alarm sounded on my phone. We stopped to pray then I checked in with my husband Bob.” “Honey if it’s real we’re toast!” Bob said “but we’re going to see the Lord.” Bev and Octavia Young decided to return home. “I suppose one reason Bob and I took the news so calmly is that we’re getting up there in age and we don’t expect to live that much longer anyway!” Rod and Fran Macalintal were getting ready for the day when the alert came. Their older kids were out with their grandfather; the youngest was having breakfast. “I couldn’t find confirmation on the radio” says Rod “but we decided to do the most we could do and then find out whether it was real. I gathered Fran and Miriam in our innermost room (the bathroom). I prayed with them for peace and for mercy for our kids who were out. I told Fran that if it’s time to go home praise God. I suspected it was a false alarm because there wasn’t any chaos at a nearby military base. Soon we heard the all-clear.” Rod also has some advice: “We can learn something from disasters. Normally someone is worried about their loved ones who survive. So take out some insurance. And when things are out of your control stop worrying about it. Take out your insurance in God.” The day ended for many branch members at a previously scheduled Lord’s Day opening at Don and Alana’s. Ron Gouveia the principal branch coordinator recalls “That evening I was struck by all the sharings of gratitude. We were simply celebrating the goodness of the Lord and his wonderful love for us.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6552

6548,May 1 2018 1:08 p.m.,Retiree on a Mission,Joe a veteran of previous service trips gives a tour of the neighborhood to this year’s service team volunteers in Evansville. by Anne Osterhouse Photos: George Kane Chris Vieck Editor’s note: With this article on Joe Maguire who is serving in the Missionary Company in Evansville we are beginning a series of articles on community members doing interesting things during their retirement. If you have a suggestion for a future story in this series please contact us at [email protected] Last spring Joe Maguire stunned many in the northern Virginia branch when he announced that he would be fully retiring stepping down from his position as an area coordinator and leaving his branch of nearly 34 years. He would move hundreds of miles away from his children and grandchildren to Evansville to join the Missionary Company. In the fall of 2016 Joe who had spent 44 years working in title insurance had started thinking seriously about moving somewhere new to work for the Lord. His wife Michele had died of cancer in 2004 and his four children were all adults. “He was very free” says Bill Dalgetty who served with Joe for many years in Christians in Commerce. “He didn’t have the family responsibilities he had once.” Joe had visited the new starts in Indianapolis Evansville and Allendale on service trips with other members of the northern Virginia branch as well as on two Action trips. He had enjoyed the physical work on various properties but says “What really struck me was what a great need there was to go out and talk to people about the Lord.” He recalls knocking on a door during a trip to Evansville and meeting a middle-aged man with health problems. “When we spoke to him it was apparent that he didn’t know much about God. He had been to church maybe three or four times in his entire life. It really hit me how much that need was out there.” In November 2016 Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty gave the men’s retreat in northern Virginia and Joe spoke to him about the possibility of joining the Missionary Company. The two of them agreed to pray about it. Principal Branch Coordinator Bob Magill was Joe’s head at the time. “I was watching this desire build in him to do mission work” Bob says. At 70 Joe was still physically capable but he could see signs that he might not be for much longer. He thought that if he waited till the end of his term as coordinator it might be too late. Bob recalls that Joe told him “I’ll really do whatever the Lord wants me to do but the desire that I have that keeps growing is to be a missionary.” Bob spoke to Craig Lent the overall coordinator who agreed that Bob should take Joe through a discernment process and he eventually approved Joe’s resignation as area coordinator. Bob says that Joe was “a great coordinator with a lot of pastoral gifts. For us in the branch we felt like we were giving a lot by giving Joe. He had such a big role here. We were saying in a sense take one of our best. It wasn’t easy. We had to go through a new coordinator nomination. Our reaction was we really do have something big to give to help with the new starts.” In June 2017 Joe retired handed off his duties as area coordinator and moved to Evansville. He made a one-year commitment to the Missionary Company. In Evansville he spends much of his time doing construction work for the properties on the missionaries’ target block where he has led renovations on three different homes.  Joe Maguire cleans up at 1201 S. Linwood—the very first house owned by the People in Praise in Evansville. “Joe works like a horse. He’s quick to grasp concepts and doesn’t need a lot of direction. He’s never failed to accomplish well whatever project we’ve asked him to do” says Paul Hommes who leads the team’s property work. “I also run a lot of ideas about Linwood Construction past him. On any sort of business or finance questions he knows exactly what we’re talking about and has some opinions as well as just a good head on his shoulders.” On days when he’s not doing construction work Joe spends his mornings praying and going through a missionary formation course with the other missionaries and in the afternoons he’s knocking on doors. “In some ways Joe is new to mission work” Nick says “but he’s got a lot of life experience so the people we meet respect him. There are a lot of good conversations he’s been able to have because of his age and his experience with marriage and raising kids that the rest of us single missionaries can’t really have.” Nick adds that Joe’s pastoral gifts come in handy in our new start. He is leading community meetings leading Servant School heading two men and he led the service trip from northern Virginia in February. “I personally really value all his insights” Nick says. “I consult with him regularly about the decisions we’re making particularly as regards our community life here.” Joe says that moving so far away from his family was a challenge. “I was more concerned about the kids than about myself.” Orest Holovaty who heads Joe’s men’s group in Evansville says “Although Joe is far from D.C. and his home he still cares for his family. He has gone back several times and keeps in touch with them. He has not abandoned them in starting a new life here.” Reflecting on the past year Joe adds “For me it’s been a good change. I feel very fulfilled being here. I feel that the Lord is using me on a daily basis.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6548
6557,May 1 2018 1:03 p.m.,Jon Balsbaugh: Not All Who Wander Are Lost,Jon loves to teach. Here he fills in for an absent teacher in junior boys’ Humane Letters. by Sean Connolly Photos: Gina Busk Jon Balsbaugh Tom Bowar I t’s 8:25 on a Wednesday morning and Jon Balsbaugh the new president of Trinity Schools strides into the junior boys’ Humane Letters Seminar with coffee mug in hand. (He’s filling in for a few weeks for a Greenlawn teacher on parental leave.) Fifteen young men wait for him with their marked-up copies of Plato’s Phaedo the dialogue that contains Socrates’ case for the immortality of the soul. Six narrow tables are arranged in a hexagonal shape beneath the white fluorescent lights but Jon doesn’t sit down alongside the students or pull out a book choosing to stand at a green chalkboard. As the boys summarize the argument Jon creates a visual map of its logic in a neat all-caps hand. When the discussion shifts from one-by-one summarizing to pell-mell debating he lets it run free jumping in occasionally to help a quiet boy break into the verbal scrum or to pose a question. Watching the conversation unfold I realize that his stance outside the hexagon has a purpose. The students face one another and speak to one another as equals instead of constantly looking to their teacher for approval. They debate the question of whether the human body is a distraction to the soul’s pursuit of wisdom as Socrates claims it is. Then a taller student gets up from the table to lower a window blind but he tugs too hard on the cord and the blind bursts through its brackets and falls to the floor. The students burst into laughter and a little applause. “Why did you get up to lower those curtains?” Jon asks. “Because the light was distracting.” There is more laughter and humorous banter. “Quite seriously” Jon says breaking through the noise. “We’re sitting here trying to have a good conversation the light comes in the window and you suddenly can’t think!” “Socrates’ point exactly” a student says.***Jon began teaching at Trinity School at River Ridge in 1997 fresh from graduate school where he had earned an M.A. in English. At the time his wife Jen was pregnant with their first child and the young father-to-be says he badly needed a job. A west coast native he had never heard of Trinity Schools but a friend showed him the list of books students read and an article about the school and he knew he had to teach there. He stayed on for 20 years teaching art history earth science and Scripture among other things and says that his only regret is that he never taught math. But he was most at home in the Humane Letters classroom teaching the 12th grade seminar 18 times. Standing among the students he felt that he was doing what he had been born to do—like Eric Liddell the Scottish sprinter and hero of the movie Chariots of Fire who would toss his head back as he ran down the homestretch. “I believe God made me for a purpose” says Liddell’s character in the movie “and when I run I feel his pleasure.” “What I am at heart is a teacher” Jon says. And so his two great transitions—from teacher to head of school at River Ridge in 2010 and then from head of school to president of Trinity Schools Inc. in 2017—each meant a kind of death: he would be doing less often the one thing that he loved most. He explains these decisions in simple terms. “There was some recognition in listening to the Lord that somebody has to do this and the Lord might be calling me to do it.” The jobs would create new ways for him to teach and learn. Dr. John Vogel a retired River Ridge math teacher knows Jon well as a colleague fellow men’s group member and Jon’s head for many years. He recalls how soon after becoming head of school at River Ridge Jon rearranged the desks in the faculty room altering the pattern from pods of four to six desks to two long rows of desks facing each other a new spatial geometry that allowed the faculty to see one another more clearly. He kept a desk of his own there working there often using his private office when he needed to meet with faculty parents and students. “He explained that the faculty room should not be a library or a place where people go to work quietly” John says. Instead it should feel like “a newsroom from the 1950s or ‘60s full of noise of people yelling out to each other talking clacking on typewriters a very lively place.” In a 2010 talk to River Ridge students Jon described the diverse kinds of conversations that break out among the faculty: “Within a few days I have been in conversations . . . about agribusiness the medieval worldview and whether or not the novel ever died as an art form. I’ve listened to Vivaldi with Mrs. Amundson and to a Punjabi musician with Mr. Showalter. I read an article Dr. O’Hanley gave me on the man who discovered penicillin . . . discussed Walker Percy with Ms. Adams and talked about the [ancient] Greek view of Egyptian antiquity with Ms. Radtke.” He wanted the students to have this same kind of frolicking wonder and so he announced one day that regular classes would be cancelled in favor of what he called Das Lernvergnügenfest or “Free Learning Day.” The students could spend the day pursuing their interests in special classes taught by Trinity teachers covering everything from poetry to Italian cooking to advanced math. A new tradition was born. Jon’s wife Jen is cut from the same cloth. She tells me that her own love of learning flourished in a book club she participated in with other women. Over the course of 12 years “We worked our way through a substantial portion of the Trinity curriculum.” The group wanted to read Milton’s Paradise Lost but felt that to really understand the book they had to start with Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey Virgil’s Aeneid and Dante’s Divine Comedy which they read before finally getting to Milton. The Balsbaughs have five children including one Trinity graduate (Dietrich) and three current students (Anna Emily Nora) as well as a fifth child Charis. Jen says she and Jon are united in their love and support of Trinity.***During his 20 years at River Ridge Jon’s sense of wonder and his eclectic interests (photography poetry Japanese aesthetics Cambodian food Bob Dylan old buildings etc.) became known to the school community as did his personality—his willingness like the gadfly Socrates to incite conversation with questions and stick around for a couple of hours as the issues got sorted out. When he came to South Bend last summer to take the job of president veteran teachers at Greenlawn knew him but not the students so he asked to address them at a morning prayer last fall. After some opening pleasantries he began to incite: “It’s funny honestly that I should have become the president of a nationwide school system . . . because frankly I really dislike school. I want you to know that. I hate all this silliness. I mean think about it for a minute. The bells the grades the uniforms homework. Really?” Understanding what he was getting at—the difference between “school” and real learning—requires a trip back to his childhood. He grew up in Adair Village Oregon a town of about 500 the son of a machinist father and a stay-at-home mother. Though neither of his parents attended college both very much valued education. Dissatisfied with the local schools they chose to homeschool at a time (the early 1980s) when homeschooling was as he says “barely legal.” Jon says he didn’t care much for the regular subjects but when he was 12 he picked up a copy of Homer’s Iliad and read it cover to cover on a camping trip. He later attended a Christian middle/high school where he read Great Expectations by Charles Dickens and had a profound experience: finding his own thoughts mirrored in those of the main character Pip. (Pip felt a tension between staying true to his working class background and the possibilities education could open up for him.) Though he was a National Merit commended scholar and the valedictorian of his class Jon didn’t want to go to college hoping instead to ride his bicycle across the country with a friend. When the road trip plans fell through he reluctantly applied to the Master’s College a nondenominational Christian school in Santa Clarita California majoring first in youth ministry then in English. By the end of his sophomore year he was ready to quit. He spent that summer working in a machine shop hoping to understand more intimately the work his father had excelled at. He liked to pass his evenings with a fishing rod in one hand and a Jane Austen novel in the other. He longed for friends who shared his growing interests in literature and in theology but he hadn’t found those kind of friends at school. He wanted to quit and asked the manager of the machine shop for a full-time job. The manager refused telling Jon that he had never finished college himself and that he wasn’t going to be a party to Jon’s dropping out. The next year several new students transferred into the college and Jon found what he had been looking for. They formed a debating club the Dead Prophets’ Society and met on Friday nights to discuss short papers. “My life would have been quite different had it not been for that group of friends” he says. “They were serious intellectuals and serious Christians.” One of those friends gave Jon a definition of education that has stuck with him over the years: “Education is composed of long periods of dignified confusion punctuated by moments of pristine coherence that endear the soul to learning.” “I dislike school but I love learning” he told the students at Greenlawn. “And here’s an insight for you about Trinity Schools. Most of your Trinity teachers are exactly the same way. And we want you to be the same way.”***  Jon took this photo of a fire hydrant a few blocks away from Greenlawn as part of his “South Bend 365” project. I take Jon on a driving tour of the northwest side of South Bend through a landscape of vacant lots dilapidated houses and winter grit. It’s a part of town that many local residents avoid and have long since moved away from myself included. Ever since he arrived in South Bend Jon has made a habit of wandering the city and the surrounding countryside following the roads wherever they take him. He brings his camera and takes pictures of the things he finds not just the local landmarks but oddities that locals like me have stopped noticing: an abandoned trailer the underside of a bridge a man crossing a snowy street an old cemetery or church. He set a goal for himself of posting a picture a day for a year the first year of his new life in South Bend. He learned photography while teaching a colloquium at River Ridge getting as much out of the course as any of the students. He began deliberately taking his camera with him until eventually he carried it most of the time. He loved going to the Minnesota State Fair and taking pictures of the human carnival he found there. “I like the choices involved in presenting an image or looking at something” he says. I tell him that I’ll gladly stop the car if he sees something he wants to photograph and sure enough he notices something I hadn’t seen a roadside memorial that consists of a shaggy pink stuffed bear strapped to a street light surrounded by empty vodka bottles. “To me gritty realism is not at odds with the power of beauty to move the human soul” he said later.***  Jon and Jen Balsbaugh at a large farewell party attended by Servant Branch members Trinity School faculty and students as well as other guests at River Ridge last June 2. Back in the Humane Letters classroom the students are talking about Socrates’ statement that the purpose of philosophy is to practice for death. Jon decides to stop the conversation to tell them about Dr. David O’Hanley a River Ridge faculty member and community member who died on Feb. 16. He uses his smartphone to play an audio recording of a morning prayer talk David gave to River Ridge students not long before he learned of his own cancer diagnosis. In the reflection David a geologist by training a man well-versed in the importance of accurate measurements said that it’s foolish to measure the value of life based on the number of times you have gone around the sun. “I think you should count your life based on playing a soccer game or building something or visiting relatives defending a friend attending weddings and funerals and having thought-provoking conversations in public places where they kick you out because they’re closing. Forget you have a watch. Forget that there’s a clock on the wall. And be surprised when the bell rings ending class.” After the recording ends Jon turns to the boys. “Can you see him practicing for his own death . . . ? A week later he found out he had cancer. . . . He didn’t have a bucket list. He wanted to keep teaching.” Jon pauses choking up for a moment. “This practice for death this is real real stuff.” He ends the class on that note wrapping up a few minutes before the bell rings their learning for the day accomplished. The rhythms of “school” haven’t quite overtaken them. Later he tells me that next semester he hopes to get out of the president’s office and teach a class. “The whole mission of this place is education and I cannot be in touch with that unless I’m actively doing it.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6557
6528,March 28 2018 11:58 p.m.,When Was the Last Supper? The Moon May Have the Answer,A lunar eclipse photographed by Craig Lent (South Bend) in Niles MI October 27 2004. by Sean Connolly Photos: Craig Lent NOW IT WAS THE DAY OF PREPARATION for the Passover; and it was about noon” (Jn. 19:14). “On the first day of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb is sacrificed his disciples said to him “Where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?” (Mk. 14:12). If you read the four Gospels and pay attention to the sequence of events during the week of Jesus’ crucifixion you may spot a puzzle. Matthew Mark and Luke all indicate that the Last Supper was a Passover meal but John says that Jesus was crucified the day before the Passover. Who’s right? Colin Humphreys a physicist and a metallurgist at the University of Cambridge tackles this puzzle in his book The Mystery of the Last Supper (2011). Humphreys is versatile relying on astronomy computer programming knowledge of ancient calendars biblical insight and deduction. His book is a fast read a bit like a detective story. His conclusions are perhaps surprising but they do have an advantage—they appear to solve the mystery. HUMPHREYS BEGINS BY PINPOINTING the date of Jesus’ death including the day month and year. The day is easy since all four Gospels indicate that Jesus died on a Friday. The month is easy too since Passover always occurs on the 15th of the month of Nisan in the Jewish calendar. This means that according to John Jesus died on the eve of Passover Nisan 14. But if the synoptic Gospels are correct then Jesus died on the day of Passover itself or Nisan 15. (Recall that Jewish days run from sunset to sunset so the post-sunset Last Supper and the crucifixion could have happened on the same day.) Getting the year right is harder. Humphreys narrows down the time frame to 10 years—AD 26 to 36 a range most scholars accept. To home in further he turns to astronomy. The Jews used a lunar calendar. Humphreys says “The priests of the temple in Jerusalem had a team of men who each month looked for the new crescent moon. When at least two of these trustworthy witnesses agreed they had seen it . . . trumpets were blown to tell all Jerusalem that it was a new moon and a new month.” THIS RAISES AN INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY. Since Jewish dates are determined by the moon is it possible to wind the lunar clock backward and figure out when Nisan 14 or Nisan 15 would have occurred during the target timeframe? Scientists have tried this since the 1930s but there’s a problem with their efforts. The start of a Jewish month depended on seeing the crescent moon. There are observational factors such as the brightness of the crescent the darkness of the sky atmospheric degradation etc. that could have affected when the Jews declared the start of a month. In 1981 Humphreys worked with Oxford astrophysicist Graeme Waddington to see if they could include these observational factors in computer calculations. They published their results in the scientific journal Nature in 1983. Humphreys says “These calculations agree with over one thousand recorded observations of new moons and give the correct answer every time. We can therefore have considerable confidence in them.” Waddington’s calculations show that there are only four possible years between AD 26 and 36 when either Nisan 14 or Nisan 15 fell on a Friday: 27 30 33 and 34. Humphreys is able to eliminate the years 27 and 34 by correlating data from the Gospels with data from Roman historians. He then rules out AD 30 since as he argues John the Baptist’s ministry could have started no later than AD 28 and Jesus’ ministry lasted for three years. This leaves only the year 33. By translating the Jewish calendar to the Gregorian calendar we use today he comes up with the date Friday April 3 AD 33! Humphreys goes on to confirm this date using a different approach. In Acts 2 Peter quotes the prophet Joel: “In the last days . . . the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood.” Some scholars suggest that on the day of Pentecost Peter wasn’t predicting future events but claiming that these signs had already taken place. F.F. Bruce writes “[L]ittle more than seven weeks earlier the people of Jerusalem had indeed seen the darkening of the sun during the early afternoon of Good Friday; and later in that same afternoon the paschal full moon may well have risen blood red in the sky in consequence of that preternatural gloom.” In the ancient world the phrase “blood moon” was used to describe a type of lunar eclipse that occurs when the moon is in the earth’s shadow causing the moon to appear a deep bloodlike red. (Perhaps you noticed the “blood moon” that appeared in the sky around Passover time in 2014.) Humphreys asked Waddington to calculate all possible lunar eclipses visible from Jerusalem during the time of Passover in the years AD 26 to 36. Waddington returned one and only one date Friday April 3 AD 33!  A crescent moon. THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE INTRIGUING but Humphreys still has some explaining to do. If John is right that Jesus died on Nisan 14 why do Matthew Mark and Luke say that Jesus ate a Passover meal before he died? Humphreys puts forward his major hypothesis: perhaps John was using a different calendar from the other Gospel writers. In modern times we’re accustomed to relying on just one standard calendar. Yet many Christians are aware that Orthodox Christians use the Julian calendar to calculate the dates for Christmas and Easter while Western Christians follow the Gregorian calendar. The official Jewish calendar in use during Jesus’ lifetime originated during the Babylonian exile (586 to 537 BC). The names of the Jewish months and the sunset-to-sunset day are both based on the Babylonian calendar. What calendar did the Jews use before the exile? This is a difficult question to answer historically but there is a clue in Exodus 12:1-2 when God tells Moses when the new year should start. Humphreys suggests that the Jews were already relying on the lunar calendar in use in Egypt and that they shifted the start date forward in keeping with God’s command. The Egyptian lunar calendar measured its days from sunrise to sunrise. This means the Jews would have had to change the way they dated their feasts when they adopted the Babylonian calendar during the exile. In the preexilic calendar the Jews would have slaughtered the Passover lamb and eaten the Passover on the same day Nisan 14. But a Babylonian calendar would have meant that when it came time to eat the meal after sunset the date would have changed to Nisan 15. Naturally a dating change of this magnitude would have caused some controversy and Humphreys points to several Jewish writers who believed that the official Jewish calendar was wrong about when the major feasts should be celebrated. Is there any evidence that a preexilic calendar was in use during the time of Jesus? ENTER THE SAMARITANS a group that as many scholars believe lived in Israel before the exile a group which even today follows an ancient calendar one they claim goes back to Moses. The Samaritan calendar is a lunar calendar but it calculates the start of months differently beginning them at conjunction—when the earth moon and sun come into alignment. This is the exact same way the ancient Egyptians calculated the start of their months. Humphreys says Samaritan and ancient Egyptian calendars would have been equivalent—except that the Samaritans start their year in the spring just as God told Moses to do. If this assumption is true it would suggest that the Samaritan calendar and the preexilic Jewish calendar would have been the same. Humphreys goes on to argue that at least two other groups the Essenes and the Zealots probably followed the preexilic Jewish calendar. Was Jesus following such an alternative calendar? Humpreys sees a clue hidden in Mark 14:12. Mark tells us that the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread which was the Passover. This is impossible according to the official Jewish calendar because the lamb was slaughtered the day before Passover on Nisan 14. But if Jesus was celebrating the Passover on Nisan 14 and using a calendar with a sunrise to sunrise day then Mark’s sentence makes sense. Humphreys suggests that Mark was cluing his readers in to the fact that Jesus was using the traditional preexilic calendar. Humphreys sees another hidden clue in the “man carrying a jar of water” who was to lead the disciples to the upper room (Lk. 22:10). Most Jewish men did not carry jars of water but Essene men did. The man carrying water could have been an Essene living in the Essene quarter of Jerusalem someone who was willing to allow the disciples to celebrate the Passover early because he was following the traditional calendar. The official calendar puts Nisan 14 on a Friday in the year 33 but what day would Nisan 14 have fallen on according to the preexilic calendar? Humphreys and Waddington again wind the clock backwards and come up with an answer: Wednesday. In fact the Gospels never explicitly state that Jesus and his disciples ate the Last Supper on a Thursday. There are certain advantages to this scenario. Scholars have often wondered how it was possible for Jesus to eat the Last Supper on Thursday night pray in the Garden get arrested appear for questioning before Annas appear before Caiphas and the Sanhedrin for a lengthy trial appear before Pilate appear before Herod and again before Pilate all by Friday morning the day when he was crucified. (Mark puts the time at 9:00 a.m.) If that Last Supper happened on Wednesday there would be sufficient time for all these events. HUMPHREYS FINISHES HIS BOOK BY pointing out the symbolism in play if his conclusions are correct: “By using the preexilic calendar Jesus held his Last Supper as a real Passover meal on the exact anniversary of the first Passover described in the book of Exodus thus identifying himself as a new Moses instituting a new covenant and leading God’s people out of captivity. Jesus died at about 3 p.m. on Nisan 14 in the official Jewish calendar at the time the Passover lambs were slain thus becoming identified with the Passover sacrifice.” What do other scholars make of Humphreys’s conclusions? In a 2013 article Helen K. Bond a scholar at the University of Edinburgh accepts the astronomical calculations of Humphreys and Waddington but rejects the idea that Jesus had to die on either Nisan 14 or 15 and so she comes to a different less precise conclusion. Oxford Bible scholar Nicholas King predicts that New Testament scholars will “bridle restively at this book” but he says that Humphreys has made a case convincing enough that it needs to be answered by Bible scholars. King accepts Humphreys’s conclusion that the Last Supper happened on a Wednesday but he points out that Humphreys does not give anything more than circumstantial evidence for some of his other conclusions. In his book Jesus and the Victory of God (1997) N.T. Wright suggests that the Last Supper was not a full Passover meal eaten with a lamb but a highly symbolic “quasi-Passover.” He believes that Jesus and his disciples celebrated the Passover before the date on the official calendar consistent with what Humphreys concludes. Pope Benedict XVI surprised many in 2007 when he suggested in his homily on Holy Thursday that Jesus celebrated Passover “at least one day earlier” than Thursday. But he didn’t go as far as suggesting that Christians move their Holy Thursday celebrations ahead by one day. Will that ever happen? Only time will tell but until the issue is resolved you can read Humphreys’s book and draw your own conclusion.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6528

Later that afternoon Ben and Cedric commiserate together on Cedric’s porch chatting with the city workers and waiting for the water for their block to be turned back on. Mary Beckley and Lori Twining teachers at Praise Academy and members of the Sisterhood who also live on that block are a bit puzzled because someone keeps hauling their trash out to the road before they can do it themselves. Mary finally figures out that the culprit is Kenny a quiet neighbor. He has been taking care of their trash for more than a year and does so for everybody else on the block as well. When Brandon’s job takes him to Houston to help with renovations after Hurricane Harvey sisters on the Christians in Mission team bring his wife LaToya and their kids meals each night for the first two weeks.

David finds Miss Agatha’s daughter Jasmine and asks “Is there anything we can do to help?” “I don’t know” she replies. “I don’t know what we’re going to do.” After the firemen leave David confirms with Jasmine that the family has a place to stay for the night. He repeats his offer. “Please let us know what we can do. We would love to help you with anything.” Later that evening Jasmine calls. “David when you said ‘anything’ what did you mean? . . . My Mom is going to need a bed.” The next morning David goes looking for the bed. He soon establishes that the CIM team has an extra mattress and another neighbor has a box-spring and bedframe. Other neighbors bring over food and spare cash. One neighbor brings bed linens towels and other basic household supplies that she has just bought for her own family telling David that Miss Agatha needs them more. David brings everything over to Miss Agatha’s. “I want you to know that this stuff didn’t come from me” he says since all the neighbors requested they remain anonymous. “God is really taking care of y’all and everyone in this neighborhood wants to help.” Miss Agatha keeps pulling items out of the bags saying “We sure need this. . . . Yep we need this too.”***On a mild December morning Joan Pingel gets a call from a Praise Academy mom Shabarbara.

While David heads over to the house with a compressor Jared drops off Paris and the toddlers at Praise Academy and then takes Shabarbara and the other kids where they need to go. John and Jo Zimmel prompted by the Holy Spirit during their personal prayer arrive at the school from their house next door offering to help. They take the toddlers enabling the teachers to go on with their classes as usual. Jared and Shabarbara return with her infant to her house where they learn that the compressor didn’t work. David and Shabarbara drive over to a shop to pick up a new tire. On their way back home she turns to David and asks him “So are you part of the family?” “What do you mean?” “Well I know that some people are related and some people aren’t but you are all like one big family.” David grins. “Yeah I’m part of the family. Do you want to be part of the family?” Shabarbara reflects a moment then answers. “I feel like Paris is already part of the family because you all treat the kids like they’re family.

6478,March 15 2018 3:14 p.m.,In Corvallis a City on a Hill Keeps Shining,Tom and Jessica Melton and some of their children on the deck of their new home. (Not pictured: their son Chris.) Behind them is the community center and Tim and Jo Wagner’s home. by Chris Meehan and Anne Osterhouse Photos: John Carey If you stand on top of Mary’s Peak—at 4097 feet the tallest point in the Central Oregon Coast Range—you can clearly see a large red colonial-style house which sits on top of a hill outside Corvallis. Set back from an idyllic country road which is flanked on one side by a Douglas fir woods and on the other by tidy garden beds and a handful of well-pruned fruit trees the house is at the heart of a cluster of 10 houses originally built and owned by members of The Vine and the Branches community which later became the Corvallis branch. For 40 years it has been the site of many branch gatherings parties and meetings the house where scores of people have stayed for a night or a few months and the yard where many branch children have played games long after dark on summer evenings. This year since long-time owners Francis and Betty Johnson have moved into an assisted living facility it is switching owners but—to the relief of many—it is staying in the community. When Tom and Jessica Melton’s fifth child Lydia was born last March they knew their house a few miles away from “the hill” as the cluster is known wasn’t going to last their family much longer. They had already felt like their house at 1350 square feet was bursting at the seams even before adding a new baby to the mix. They were confident that the Lord would provide for their need but they had no idea how. They started considering building an addition. Last summer Francis 91 and then Betty 95 each developed congestive heart failure which hastened their decision about whether to stay in their house. Both builders by nature Francis was part of the group of men who built most of the houses on the hill and Betty and he had spearheaded the creation of an assisted living center in town where they moved in December.  The former “Johnson Hotel” stands on one acre at the very top of a hill and is a prominent feature in the area. When the Johnsons decided to sell their house and move branch members started asking “How can we keep it in the community? Who could live in it?” The Meltons certainly needed more space but they knew the Johnsons’ house would be too expensive for them. They never even considered it. John and Mary Lou Carey have lived down the hill from the Johnsons for many years and shared a garden with them. In 2001 while the Careys were remodeling their own house they and two of their teenage children moved in with the Johnsons for two months. Mary Lou is a retired nurse and as the Johnsons began developing health problems last year the Careys often walked up the hill to assist them. When the question of what to do with the Johnsons’ home arose the Careys realized that they could help even though they weren’t looking for a house themselves. They agreed to purchase the house as an investment and offered it to the Meltons on a lease-to-own basis. Jessica Melton is the daughter of branch members Chris and Colette Taylor and grew up on the hill. Her father Chris built the Johnsons’ house in 1977 along with Francis and Chris’s brother Frank. “Having the opportunity to live in Francis and Betty’s house was totally unexpected–the farthest thing from my mind” says Jessica. “Although the Lord had made it clear to me that he was going to provide the additional space we needed I never imagined I would be able to live across the street from where I grew up in a house my father built. It’s really awesome that the Careys have made it possible for us to afford it.”  Tom and Jessica Melton with four of their five children along with Francis and Betty Johnson in the living room of the house. The Johnsons’ house will be a big upgrade in space for the Meltons. It has 2700 square feet of finished space plus a large unfinished basement. The first floor has a kitchen living room master bedroom bathroom family room with a fireplace and a dining room. Upstairs there are two bedrooms another bathroom a small sewing/hobby room and a very large bonus room that is 15 feet wide by 30 feet long in which the Johnsons kept many beds almost like a dormitory. (The Meltons are renovating the bonus room adding a wall to turn it into two bedrooms bringing the total number to five.) Francis explains that they had not originally planned to make the house so big. “At first we weren’t especially focused on hospitality but we built the house extra large because the Lord told us to.” Eventually they were hosting so many people that the house became known as the “Johnson Hotel”. “The Johnsons were gracious enough to let community children and their friends play around their house on summer evenings even after dark” adds Tim Wagner. “Because it was centrally located and there were shrubs and trees for hiding plus a deck to use as home base Francis and Betty were happy to have the children play even after they had turned in for the night.”  Chris Taylor along with other family and branch members is volunteering to help the Meltons to renovate the house before they move in. It was the kind of life that the founders of the hill or Christian Village as it is also called had hoped and planned for. In 1977 Fr. Charlie Harris C.S.C. the Johnsons the Hackenbrucks the Taylors the Wagners and a few other families then part of The Vine and the Branches community bought 12 acres of rolling farmland together. They divided the property into one-acre lots and eventually built 10 houses positioning them on the corners of lots to allow for future growth and for large common spaces between them spaces that have served as sites for picnics pig roasts volleyball games and relay races over the years. An 11th home belonging to Phil and Jean Monaco lies across Nash Street and was not part of the original parcel of land. One of the lots already had a small farmhouse on it which served as Fr. Charlie’s home and office. Now expanded the house serves the branch as a community center. Six of the original 10 homes are still owned by community members and the community. For the longtime residents the hill is full of memories—like the time three families went in together and bought a few head of cattle. As Tim recalls “One day they escaped their pen. I still remember us running down the road trying to round them up.” “Sometimes I’ll just see someone’s car in their driveway and use it as an excuse to stop by” Tim adds. “The other day I delivered a mincemeat pie to Connie Hackenbruck who shares my taste for them and she Terry and I sat around and reminisced about community history for 30 minutes.” “We’re so grateful for the Careys’ generosity which will allow our original vision for shared life to continue” says Phil Monaco the principal branch coordinator. “This has been a big change for us. The Johnsons have always been literally at the center of our life and we greatly miss them up on the hill. Their magnanimous generosity to every person has been absolutely beyond compare and inspiring but it will be great to have a young family filling the gap. Our proximity has made a lot of wonderful things happen over the years and it’s precious to us.” Tom and Jessica are looking forward to continuing all the hospitality a house with five children will allow once they move in probably in February. “It’s a consolation to me that they will love it like we did and will take care of it” says Francis. He and Betty have recently been heard to say “The Johnson Hotel has new proprietors and from now on will be called the Melton Hilton.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6478
6475,March 15 2018 3:14 p.m.,Bearing Gifts and Traveling Far,Two children in Rothsay MN look forward to opening their Angel Tree gifts. by Chris Meehan Photos: Bob Pintozzi This Christmas season Servant Branch members drove 2640 miles to 23 different towns many of them hundreds of miles from the Twin Cities delivering Christmas gifts to the children of prisoners. They went to places like Karlstad Minnesota a town of fewer than 1000 people near the Canadian border and some 350 miles northwest of the Twin Cities. (The trip took two days.) In total seven teams of drivers crisscrossed the northern half of the state and even dropped some gifts in South Dakota. The effort is part of Project Angel Tree sponsored by Prison Fellowship International whose mission is to deliver presents to children on behalf of their incarcerated parents. A brief note from the parent accompanies each gift. Servant Branch members have helped out for 35 years running and they’ve earned a reputation for going wherever they’re needed. “I’m very impressed with People of Praise” said Gayle Foster who coordinates Project Angel Tree’s effort for an eight-state area. “They are willing to go the extra mile literally to help out”—traveling to towns where Angel Tree does not have any local church partners.  Brad Bye’s men’s group sorted and packaged Angel Tree gifts by family in the family room of Servant Branch’s River Ridge building. More than 150 branch members joined the effort this year says Bob O’Connell who has been the driving force behind the branch’s efforts since the start. Their work included calling families to get gift recommendations shopping for gifts and making baked goods. Jim and Norma Cahill negotiated with local grocery chain Cub Foods to procure turkeys for some of the larger families. Bruce and Charlene Olson the owners of Truestone Coffee Roasters donated 48 one-pound bags of coffee while others donated money. Each child received at least one gift along with one clothing item and a Bible in the child’s native language. (The Bibles come from International Bible Givers in Anoka Minnesota.) Families received a warm blanket coffee and baked goods while families with three or more children also received a turkey. There were plenty of frustrations as well as laughs along the way. When Bob Krause and Brad Bye reached their last stop in Hibbing Minnesota they realized that they had accidentally dropped off the gifts intended for the family in Hibbing to a family in Chisholm Minnesota (about seven miles away). They returned to Chisolm swapped out the gifts and made their way back to Hibbing! Bob O’Connell has many moving stories from the past 35 years. He remembers one time when a branch member called a woman who was caring for a young boy and girl to find out what kind of gifts the children would like. In conversation the caller learned that the children ages seven and nine had been sleeping in the same bed because their caregiver did not have the money to buy an additional bed. The woman said she had saved up some money for a secondhand bed but it had sold before she could buy it. The caller told Bob about the woman’s situation and together they spread the word among branch members. Someone donated a bed and they took it to her along with the Christmas gifts. She was stunned and delighted. Another time Bob delivered a turkey to a grandmother who walked Bob into her rundown kitchen and opened her pantry to show him one can of green beans—the only food she had. She said that if not for the turkey they would have had nothing but the beans for Christmas dinner. “Most of the time we don’t have these dramatic experiences” Bob says. “We deliver the gifts and Bibles and people say thanks and don’t invite us in because they’re embarrassed about their lack of furniture or shabby living conditions. Some people we talk with and some we pray with but we know that much of what we do is seed-planting. God is impressing upon the caregiver the prisoner and the children that he is a caring God and as we celebrate the birth of Christ it’s his love manifested through these gifts that will touch them and draw them to him bit by bit. This is what makes Angel Tree a richly rewarding labor of love for all our Servant Branch members.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6475
6296,Jan. 29 2018 2:09 p.m.,"""I Got God!” - A Testimony",by Pena Meither Photo: Glenn Rymsza My name is Agapenanincher Engkichy Meither. People call me Pena. I was born in Guam and raised in Hawaii. When I was seven I moved to Portland Oregon. One day in 2014 my parents were driving around and saw Trinity Academy. I was already looking at a different school but my parents said to me “If we let you shadow at the other school then can you come shadow at Trinity Academy? We want you to be surrounded by Christians.” Trinity Academy was way different than the other school. I noticed the students were very cheerful. I had never met anyone as enthusiastic as Dr. Jo Clark. She welcomed me with open arms. Dr. Clark told me that if I wanted to go to Trinity Academy I’d have to repeat eighth grade so I talked to my family about it. It took me a couple of months but I felt like God told me to come to Trinity. I gave up playing volleyball and basketball because I found it hard to concentrate on homework. I loved the classes. The next summer my grandma passed away. After that I was mad at the world and mad at God. I didn’t want to talk to anyone. In October a classmate invited me to the Action kickoff. I was hesitant. I told her “I don’t think God wants me back because I’ve been avoiding him.” She was persistent and other girls from Action were  persistent as well so I went. I talked to some of the college women that help in Action and they helped me realize that God will always forgive you. They kept encouraging me. My relationship with God grew a lot stronger. Sam Mertz our Action leader talked to me about applying for an Action internship. I applied really early then I got a call from Chris Vieck. She was telling me about Evansville how the neighborhood they live in used to be called “the devil’s corner” and how there was so much shooting until the People of Praise came. I thought wow this is fantastic I want to be there. I want to go somewhere they really need me. When I first got to Indiana I stayed with the Gonzalez family near Indianapolis. I was pretty antisocial but they weren’t pressuring me or judging me. They welcomed me. I also experienced welcoming when I got to Evansville. Chris came out the door running and hugged me. I barely knew her but she said “I’m so happy that you’re here!” I loved that neighborhood and all the kids. I saw God everywhere. Back at home if you’re an islander you keep it within the island community. The People of Praise likes to keep it diverse. If you’re a Protestant if you’re a Catholic they welcome you with open arms. If you’re black Hawaiian or white they still welcome you with open arms. I have never felt God’s love so strongly—towards the point where I wanted to break into tears. Before I came I had a lot of back pain due to scoliosis. At first in the summer of 2016 after I was diagnosed it wasn’t a big deal—probably 10 degrees of curvature. Then it got worse and the pain really kicked in. I couldn’t sit or stand for a long time. One day in Evansville one of the other Action girls looked at me and said “Why don’t we pray over your back?” They prayed and after that I felt no pain. When I got back home I got an X-ray. Before my back had been at 32 degrees of curvature. The X-ray showed it had gone down to five degrees. It’s getting better and better now that I’m more active and people are still praying for a complete healing. Since the summer I’ve been more persistent in my relationship with God. I don’t just go to him in distress or when I need something. I go to him as a friend. I talk to him throughout the day. My phone used to be a huge distraction from my spiritual life. First thing in the morning I would get up and look at Instagram Snapchat and Twitter. I wouldn’t talk to God. So I told my dad to disconnect the phone. I don’t regret it. Sure a lot of stuff is happening on social media but guess what? I got God! Now every day I feel God’s love.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6296
6311,Jan. 9 2018 12:34 p.m.,Three Missionary Stories,David Katcher (left) and John Crimmins are two of the fIve people who joined the Missionary Company in Evansville this year. by Chris Meehan Photo: Mary TimlerBlessed Are the SorrowfulThe blonde-haired woman who answered the door was in her 50s. Patty was quick to say she was a Christian and she spent the next 30 minutes pouring out her sorrows to three Evansville missionaries: John Earhart Joe Maguire and Mary Timler. Two of her children had wrecked three different cars and her third child was in prison. Her water and electricity had been shut off. “To top it all off three weeks ago the hearing in my left ear started to go bad. It’s like it’s blocked up but I’ve been too busy to think about it.” Standing on her front porch the missionaries laid hands on Patty and prayed concluding with a powerful “Amen!” (Their “Amen” was immediately echoed by a woman across the street.) Mary asked Patty if she could hear better. “Yes somewhat” she replied. She explained that before the prayer human voices had sounded muffled like people were mumbling. Her hearing had improved to about 70% of what it had been before the hearing problem started she said. They prayed again and this time Patty said with a smile “It’s 90 no—it’s at 100%. Wow! Thank you Jesus!” Two weeks later Mary and Joe returned with Evan Lent. Patty said her ear was still fine and her water was back on. That day her niece Allison was visiting with two of her sons. “We’ve known Allison for years but we didn’t know she was related to Patty” Evan explained. A single mom Allison said she was “really going through it.” Her brother had gone to jail and both her stepfather and an uncle had died all in a matter of a few weeks. “All the men in my family are gone” she said. “I have to be the man now.” Her water had also been cut off. “I feel like I’ve failed” she said her eyes welling up with tears. Evan suggested they stop and pray for a few minutes and listen to the Lord. “Is there such a thing as a 27th psalm?” Allison asked after the prayer. “Do you want me to read it?” asked Mary. “Is it going to make me cry?” Mary began “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? . . . For my father and mother have forsaken me but the Lord will take me in. . . . Wait for the Lord; be strong and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!” Allison shed a few more tears. The missionaries began to pray over her and they prayed with Patty too. “I knew there was a reason I came here today” Allison said with a smile.All in a Day’s WorkJohn Crimmins and David Katcher smelled marijuana as they approached a group of five men standing in an Evansville yard. One of the men held a joint. “We’re Christians. We were praying and God told us to tell people that he wants us to stop sinning” David said. “What do you think of that?” David couldn’t quite tell what they thought since the men all hid their eyes. Three of them exited the yard got in a car and drove off. “This is crazy!” the fourth man said before going inside a house. The fifth man walked away. Later that afternoon after a few more tough conversations David battled feelings of failure. He and John were both new missionaries with only a few months in the field. Thoughts such as God isn’t really with us we were not really sent out ran through his mind. Recognizing a temptation from the enemy David asked John to pray with him. His gloom lifted. The two missionaries came to another house where they found two men and two boys in the front yard. One of the men Ted began shouting at them. “We don’t need God here! We’re good. They need him down the street where the crime is worse!” “Let’s talk about that” John said. “Have you ever seen a miracle?” He told them the story about Patty. “She was probably lying to you” Ted replied. “I’m very direct. I say what’s on my mind.” His voice kept growing louder. John and David tried to match his volume speaking boldly and directly. “We didn’t perceive him as being angry at us personally so we took on the challenge of sticking to our ground as if he was testing us” John said. They told another story about a healing of a knee that turned out to involve two people Ted knew and respected. He began to soften. “I’ve had a grudge against God for over 10 years and I’m just barely starting to get over it” he admitted. His newborn son had died and afterward Ted had raged against God. “I deserved to have that baby but God took him away!” As he told the story he paced back and forth. He complained that God didn’t hear prayers that prayers always fell on deaf ears. “Ted it’s clear that you don’t realize how much God loves you” David said his heart welling up with love. “Open your eyes. His love is flowing through me to you and now I love you!” Ted smiled a little. All this while the two boys had been waiting for someone to pick them up so the missionaries offered to pray that the driver would show up soon. They were surprised when Ted agreed to join them for the prayer. He drew closer to the missionaries stopping just a few feet away from them and David and John prayed aloud for the boys and that Ted would come to know God’s love. After the prayer they asked Ted if they could come back and see him again. “Sure” he said smiling again. “As we walked away we shook our heads in disbelief” said David. “There were little changes in his demeanor as we talked that kept us persisting. We were challenging without being aggressive and that’s what it took to make the difference.” A few weeks later they returned approaching Ted with big smiles on their faces. “I’ve never had people so excited to see me” he said. Ted’s grandmother came out of the house and Ted introduced the missionaries to her. “I just met these guys and I feel like I’ve known them for 10 years. I didn’t get what they were saying at first but now I get it. It’s true that God loves us.” He turned to the two missionaries. “That night after we spoke I got on my knees and asked God to help me. I’ve been praying ever since. I pray for you guys too.”Dogged Determination“I think it’s a bad idea for you to come today.” Donna was brusque with the two missionaries who knocked on the door of her well-kept home late last summer. Before she could shut the door though her little dog ran out tore through the yard and onto the busy avenue. David chased the dog dodging traffic and brought him back safely to Donna’s house. About a week later he was staffing the missionaries’ produce stand outside their urban farm when Donna dropped by for the first time but neither David nor Donna recognized each other. It was only afterward when David knocked on Donna’s door a second time that they put two and two together. Eventually more missionaries got to know Donna and her initial brusqueness faded. She would greet them with a smile though she told them with sadness that her dog had died after being run over by a car. Donna lived alone and told them how upset she was about losing the dog who was her primary companion. On a Wednesday in November David and Ellen Reed went to visit Donna again. David and two other missionaries had independently gotten words about offering Donna the baptism in the Holy Spirit so they were hoping to offer to pray with her for it. When they got there they learned that Donna was having a hard week. She had pneumonia and didn’t invite them in. Her back hurt and she was bracing her body against the doorframe while they talked. David suggested they pray with her. After the prayer “Her back immediately was better” David says. “Her whole demeanor changed.” For the remainder of their conversation Donna kept moving her back around remarking joyfully “Wow God is with me.” Ellen mentioned that her back also hurt from standing in one spot for so long so the group prayed with Ellen. She too felt instantly better. “We all rejoiced together” David said. Figuring the moment was ripe to bring up the Holy Spirit David spoke to Donna about Pentecost and the two missionaries shared their testimonies. “Would you like this?” David asked. “Come on in!” Donna said. After some more explanation and a few more questions for Donna the missionaries prayed with her to receive the Holy Spirit. Afterward David warned her that the devil might try to convince her that nothing had happened during the prayer. “No problem there” Donna replied. “I know something happened!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6311
6298,Jan. 9 2018 12:33 p.m.,The Holy Spirit Stirs in Buffalo,Jim and Patty’s home is the meeting place for both the men’s and women’s groups in the neighborhood. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: John Gehl The Black Rock neighborhood of Buffalo sits on a bluff overlooking the Niagara River. It’s an area of once stately homes where neighbors can recall children playing outside safely until the street lights went off. Today there are gangs and drugs and low-cost housing that attracts immigrants from all over the world. It’s not uncommon to meet neighbors from Myanmar Eritrea and Afghanistan along with the long-time residents who raised children in the area. Four years ago after prayer and discernment the Buffalo branch decided to start a prayer meeting in Black Rock. “Initially we did a fair amount of advertising in the local newspaper and church bulletins and by flyers and word of mouth” explains Bud Northway who leads the branch’s outreach efforts. Branch members walked the streets visited a local soup kitchen and hung flyers praying with strangers and talking to anyone they could. They forged a connection with Fr. Richard Jedrzejewski the pastor of Church of the Assumption a local Catholic parish who was eager to host the meeting in his church. The prayer meeting eventually took hold drawing faithful participants from Black Rock and from the branch. The branch’s outreach team formed a men’s group and a women’s group for the prayer meeting regulars and both are still going strong. The prayer meeting takes place on Thursday nights drawing about 20 people and lasting about two hours. Branch member George Meyerhofer plays the guitar alongside Jim a longtime Black Rock resident and baptized-in-the-Spirit Catholic who with his wife Patty hosts the men’s and women’s group meetings at the former convent they call home. Of the women in the women’s group Marilyn Northway says “Once they started coming they’ve all been faithful. We support one another’s lives just as we do in the branch.”  Bud Northway and Martha Delaney (in blue) join a prayer group member in praying with another prayer group member at the Life in the Spirit Seminar held in Black Rock this past November. George recalls a funny moment when he and Bud wanted to introduce the practice of birthday honorings to the Black Rock men’s group. “We probably spent 45 minutes trying to explain what we were proposing” he recalls. “I don’t think the men really understood what we were trying to do because they thought we were just going to be saying all this flowery stuff. They felt they might be a little embarrassed. So Bud and I looked at each other and we just launched into doing it. As we finished up the honoring the other men were like ‘So that’s what you meant! Wow. That was pretty cool.’” Honorings have been a tradition in the group ever since. The last few summers the branch paid the costs for children from the Black Rock neighborhood to attend their annual Buffalo Camp. Seven children came to camp in 2017 and afterward they brought their families to an event the branch hosted in Black Rock trading stories and introducing their parents to branch members.* * *  Winter in the Black Rock neighborhood of Buffalo. When Bill an attendee of the prayer meeting and a member of the Black Rock men’s group first brought his daughter Tina to the prayer meeting she had been addicted to cocaine for more than 15 years. One night in 1994 Tina a young hairdresser and dance instructor was in a car with some friends when the driver turned up the music floored the gas pedal and took the car off the road to kill herself. Tina survived but severe injuries to her leg caused a near amputation and three subsequent knee surgeries. Three years after the accident she was unable to dance or hold a hairdressing job due to her injuries. Tina was just coming off the prescription painkillers she’d been given for her leg when she went to a party where she saw a friend sniffing cocaine. “It gave me this extra energy. It filled in a gap. And that was the first time I did any type of hard drug” she recalls. Throughout her twenties Tina struggled with cocaine addiction. She moved back and forth across the country but would periodically return to live in Buffalo. She shed 35 pounds and looked thin pale and sickly. Aware that her life needed to change she spent the next several years in and out of various types of drug rehab programs but often she would come back to Black Rock see her former acquaintances and dealers and fall back into drug abuse.  Tim Hammer (middle) leads a discussion group at the Life in the Spirit Seminar. She said a turning point came in 2014 when she went on the Buffalo branch’s women’s retreat. When she arrived she hadn’t slept for three days due to her cocaine use. “I felt really great being in this holy spot” she recalls before adding “I was nervous. I was shaky. You couldn’t tell that I was shaking but my veins were shaking inside me.” Tina hit it off with Arlene Meyerhofer who took her to the kitchen and fed her strawberries and chocolate. On Saturday night after Tina had gotten a good night’s sleep and an afternoon nap all the women on the retreat gathered to pray with her to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. Tina remembers “They prayed for me to be healed and it was just powerful. . . . I knew I was  going to be okay. I was going to be safe. . . . Really where the change began is when they invited me to go on that retreat.” Marilyn Northway recalls seeing Tina the next morning. “She looked different. She said that when she looked in the mirror that morning she hardly recognized the face: big smile and bright bright eyes. She didn’t have the look of the drug addict from the night before.” Over the next two years or so Tina still struggled with her drug use and moved in and out of Buffalo but something had changed. Marilyn remembers “She’d have periods of being clean and then she’d fall back. But the women in the branch would call her and she’d call them and ask for prayers and she would occasionally come to the women’s group. The periods when she was clean kept increasing in length.” Tina says “I always stayed in touch with Arlene when I was on my journeys and I would talk with her so much. And I would talk to Bud often. “The women gave me support. I had sisters. I had a mother when I needed a mother. I had friendships when I had to reach out and have a friend. I can call them up and be like ‘I don’t know what’s going on with me’ and they would just pray. In the sweetest voice ‘Okay we’ll just pray.’ They knew I had a purpose and they were going to support me no matter what.” Tina’s been clean for over a year now her longest period of freedom since she first tried cocaine. She’s found new purpose in selling skin care products online.* * *  When Assumption Church combined its elementary school with those of several other parishes the name became “Our Lady of Black Rock School.” Sayed first met the People of Praise in the person of Bruce Wansart while drinking coffee in a Wegmans grocery store in Black Rock on a Thursday afternoon. Earlier that same week Sayed a young man had arrived with his family as a new immigrant to the United States from Afghanistan after waiting for years in Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan as a refugee. Bruce had stopped in the store on the way to the Thursday night prayer meeting and he invited Sayed to come. At the prayer meeting Sayed came up to be prayed with by John Gehl and George Meyerhofer. George remembers “He said ‘This church building really jumped out at me because I had a dream or a vision about six months ago and saw this church. And so I want what you guys have.’ When we realized he was from Afghanistan we asked ‘Are you Christian?’ He said ‘No I’m Muslim.’ So John and I just glanced at each other and tried not to miss a beat. John had the wisdom–it was the Holy Spirit–to pray to the God of Abraham knowing at least fundamentally that we have that in common.” Over the next few years John befriended Sayed and his parents and siblings driving 45 minutes from his home to visit them two or three times a week. Their house had a view of the twin church steeples Sayed spoke about from his dream. John noticed that they had very little furniture so he found them a few things including a couch and a table. When it started to get cold in the fall John took the whole family out to the store for winter coats hats and gloves. Sayed recalls “Mr. John was always there to take me to the doctor to make the appointments to take me to driving school to come to my home. When he was coming back down to the city he always came to my home for lunch or for tea and he solved all the problems we had at that time. It’s unbelievable that someone is doing that just for you.” When the branch held a seder before Easter in 2016 John asked Sayed’s mother to bake the bread. “She made 10 loaves and wouldn’t take any money. She made it for us Christians. She’s a Muslim and that is just typical of their family.” Sayed’s family moved to the West Coast in 2016 to live near his sister’s new husband but John has kept in touch. John arranged for him to stay with the Brotherhood in Portland for a week when Sayed was looking for work and also put Sayed up in Buffalo when he considered moving back. They continue to keep in touch.* * *  Men praying for one another during the Life in the Spirit Seminar. This fall the Buffalo outreach team put the Thursday night prayer meetings on hold so they could run a six-week Life in the Spirit Seminar for the regulars. On the final night of the seminar they prayed with 14 people to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. The following week some of those prayed over shared their stories. A young man who lives in a group home received the gift of tongues that night. He shared that he now feels comfortable going out and walking around the Black Rock neighborhood. “You may think this is just a small thing but it’s really big for me” he explained. Another young woman from the group home spoke of the “best day of my life”—the day she was prayed with. (“Most of us when we heard her say that our eyes just welled up” Bud recalls.) One man shared that he had a joy-filled week with a renewed energy to do things. And one woman stood up and said “I am a recovering alcoholic.” She’d been in recovery for six and half years but was still tormented by nightly dreams about drinking. The whole week after she was prayed with she said that she hadn’t dreamt about alcohol once. Says Bud “Now everyone who comes with any regularity to the Black Rock prayer meeting has been prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. That’s pretty exciting.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6298

Below is an explication of the covenant which Paul gave at the 1976 covenant-making community meeting in South Bend. At the end of the talk Paul read the covenant aloud. You may notice that it differs slightly from the version we use today. In January 1986 the board of governors approved two revisions to the covenant. The first is that the word “basic” was omitted to avoid confusion with other unrelated groups known as “basic communities.” The second is that the word “Church” was made lowercase to better reflect the diversity of our various denominations. We hope that reading and discussing this will deepen your appreciation of what the Lord has called us to.

Otis Kenner pastor of Fresh Faith Worship Center presiding bishop of Kingdom Growth Fellowship of United Churches in New Orleans and vice-president of River Regions Theological College Marriage in Christ has not only been helpful in his marriage but also a source of racial reconciliation as well.I had been serving a national pro-life organization as a liaison to African Americans often as a sidewalk counselor trying to rescue those unjustly sentenced to death. My duties also involved traveling around the country speaking at national conferences seeking to wake up African-American pastors to the disproportionate numbers of black children being killed. After some time in that position events convinced me that I was the group’s token black person–admittedly anointed by the Holy Spirit but useful only because of my race. It came to a climax when I experienced what I took to be a moment of socially acceptable racism at a conference in Kansas.I couldn’t take it anymore and feeling betrayed by white people in general I left the group in anger and disgust. I’d had enough of white people. I remembered the time years before when a burning cross had been placed in the lawn of my family’s home. I had two uncles who were murdered by the KKK. The house in which my wife and I lived had been vandalized three times and the police did not act against the known culprits. I had endured 40 years of racism in the world but this incident of racism was in the church for goodness sake!I only bothered to get to know Lloyd Mehaffey (New Orleans) because mutual friends fellow pastors introduced us. Lloyd invited me and my wife Tyra to a MIC seminar where we met his wife Kathy and Tom and Diane Evans. The kindness and dignity with which they treated us totally eradicated the pain I had been experiencing. Their words and actions demonstrated that they understood how awful some of our experiences had been. We shared bread and passed the cup. Relating to the four of them has been a healing experience. We’re looking forward to working with them on bringing the Marriage in Christ program to many in the African-American community.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6219
6217,Nov. 10 2017 2:35 p.m.,Marriage Renewal Movement Gathers Steam,Couples from the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis gathered October 21 for training as host couples in the new collaborative effort with Marriage in Christ. by Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly Photos: Margaret Anderson Tom Bowar Courtesy of Marriage in Christ Becky VerweyIt’s just about 6:00 on a Sunday evening and Lou Giovannini a deacon at St. Pius X Catholic Church in Granger Indiana is standing in a small hallway shaking hands and giving hugs to departing churchgoers. With a stack of sign-up forms in one hand he encourages men he knows to come on the parish’s next Marriage in Christ seminar. Already 86 couples from St. Pius have attended the seminar including Lou and his wife Lori. “Before attending Marriage in Christ I was used to praying for my wife” he explains. “The seminar helped me to pray with her.”  Lou and Lori Giovannini from St. Pius X Parish in Granger IN. At the back of churches like St. Pius in homes and on the Internet momentum for Marriage in Christ (MIC) is building. Sometime in November couple number 1000 will complete the five-week seminar and 400 more couples are expected to be added to that number in the next two years thanks to a new collaboration between MIC and the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. (The MIC seminar a five-week program of video talks discussions and prayer was developed in Servant Branch in 2011 and the board of governors adopted it as a work of the People of Praise in 2013. The videos were produced by Greenlawn Films. It teaches couples practical skills for growing in friendship—forgiveness prayer and conversation—all animated by the power of the Holy Spirit.)The goal of the new collaboration is to bring Marriage in Christ to younger couples—newlyweds and those in the first five years of marriage—helping them to establish strong habits in the window of time between the wedding and the intense child-rearing years. To achieve this goal MIC will train host couples in how to give the seminar in up to 20 parishes around the archdiocese. So far 12 parishes have signed on. Host couple training is underway with community couples Bob and Christine Brickweg Pat and Patricia Ficker Jim and Norma Cahill Tad and Kim Bornhoft Bill and Adella Wacker and Ed and Phyllis Varevice serving as trainers. The first round of seminars will begin in January.There is a financial component to the collaboration as well. Thanks to some generous donations the cost for younger couples attending the seminar has been lowered from $85 to $25 or free if necessary. MIC has hired a part-time staff member Emily Hayden a graduate of the seminar who is helping to manage the effort and divides her time between the MIC office and the archdiocesan office.

6160,Nov. 8 2017 11:10 p.m.,People of Praise: Hard to Understand and That’s OK,A People of Praise community barbecue in Shreveport Louisiana. Click here to see our response to the most recent press attention we have been receiving. By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. A Broad OutreachIn recent years the People of Praise is perhaps best known as the founder of Trinity Schools three junior high/high schools which between them have won eight Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. For more than 35 years our schools have had a reputation for encouraging students to ask questions engage in spirited dialogue and draw their own reasoned conclusions. “I know of no better school in these United States” the late political philosopher Russell Kirk said of our flagship school in South Bend IN. Then there is our missionary work. Over the past 15 years the People of Praise has sent more than 100 people to live in some of America’s forgotten corners—places like Ms. Anderson’s Shreveport neighborhood where the per capita income is under $14000. There we and our neighbors have built and renovated homes run summer camps for thousands and started an elementary school for our neighborhood Praise Academy at Lakeside. In Evansville IN a group of People of Praise missionaries moved into two houses at a notorious intersection a place locals called “the devil’s corner” because of all the fights and drug deals. We didn’t arrive with any program or magic formula but hoped to encounter neighbors in a spirit of Christian friendship. Even so our neighbors have told us that crime has dropped off significantly because of the community we and they are building. “Every night there would be something bad going on and the police would have to park and just watch everybody” one long-time Evansville resident said. “It’s just remarkable how things have changed.”  On another front our community life provides a natural support for marriages and families and this has led us to develop Marriage in Christ a five-week course that equips couples to pray together and build crucial habits of conversation. More than 1000 couples have completed the program.Our RootsThe People of Praise has some of its roots in the Pentecostal revival that grew from a group of poor African Americans in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. Those humble believers experienced a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewal of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues. They were ridiculed in the press called “fanatics” and mocked for their lively worship. But the revival went on to inspire half a billion people including millions of Roman Catholics. The People of Praise also has roots in the Cursillo an evangelistic movement founded in Spain by Catholic laymen in the 1940s which spread to Mexico and the United States influencing some of our founding members. In 1971 after nearly seven years spent praying and studying the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers 29 people made a covenant commitment to put their lives and their futures in common. The People of Praise was born. Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage. Imperfect words will eventually fade but we remain happy and proud to be the category-defying community God has called us to be his People of Praise.   Sean Connolly (@sconnoll) is the communications director for the People of Praise community.

6131,Nov. 3 2017 12:35 p.m.,40 Years in the Great Outdoors,by Chris Meehan Photos: Tom Bowar Andy Bowar Servant Camp turned 40 in August as nearly 300 people from seven People of Praise locations came together at Camp Phillippo in Cannon Falls Minnesota.   What began in 1978 as a day camp for 15 children held in several St. Paul backyards has grown into a camp attended by an estimated 9000 campers. The original camp was the vision of Alan and Debbie Saunders a couple in Servants of the Lord community who were soon joined by fellow leaders Carmen and Gail Lee. Carmen went on to direct Servant Camp for more than 25 years until Pat Ficker took the reins in 2011. Gail a covenanted sister died in 2009.   “My favorite part of camp was the Embers campfire every night as the Butterflies (fifth-grade girls) would learn to talk about where they saw the Lord that day” said Anna Balsbaugh (South Bend) who served as a junior counselor. Seventh-grader James Oberg fondly remembers his chance to practice riflery for the first time. “It was really fun and satisfying to shoot a real gun” he says. Sixth-grader Dan Reinhardt enjoyed the climbing tower and added that “the 20-mile bike ride was really fun.” Lucia Sgroi a 10th-grader from South Bend says “My favorite activity at camp was our trips to the beach where we went kayaking and played sand volleyball.”  In a camp first Tom Bowar brought his drone to capture aerial footage of canoeing games and processions. Camp videos are available at www.servantcamp.org.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6131
6120,Nov. 3 2017 12:24 p.m.,Praise Him Sun and Moon!,Jon Balsbaugh’s photo taken in Missouri reveals some of the dramatic lighting effects caused by the eclipse. On Monday August 21 a total solar eclipse in which the moon completely blocks out the light from the sun was visible for a 70-mile-wide swath of land which cut across the US from Oregon to South Carolina.  Mary Timler and the Evansville missionaries ventured down into Kentucky to get a better view.   As the angels said to the disciples “Why are you standing there looking up at the sky?” (In this photo taken by Jeanette Duddy brothers and sisters in Allendale view the eclipse). A partial eclipse was visible everywhere in the US Canada and the Caribbean where projections of the eclipse could be seen coming through the leaves of trees and household objects like colanders or by using special eclipse glasses to look at the sun directly. Some members of the community took the opportunity to travel to the path of totality. The senior class from Trinity School at River Ridge along with numerous parents and faculty members took a two-day trip to Saint Joseph Missouri where they watched the eclipse from an airport alongside people from 5000 cars. Mission Program Coordinator Nick Holovaty who traveled to Marion Kentucky with other members of the Evansville new start as well as some guests said “I’ve been reflecting on how awesome it was but at the same time it was just so quiet. Except for two minutes and 30 seconds you might not have even noticed. It seems to me that there’s something in it like a parable of how the Lord relates to us. It was this amazing awe-inspiring thing but it was very quiet. He doesn’t force himself on you. It seemed like there was something of the Lord’s personality in it.” We hope you’ll enjoy these photos of the glory of God in the sun the moon the clouds the shadows of the trees and the brothers and sisters taking it all in.  Annie Bulger used Doug Beebe’s telescope to capture this picture of the eclipse.  Craig Lent took this time-lapse photo from a field in western Nebraska after he drove six hours in search of clear skies.  Tom Bowar took this picture of his fellow travelers from the group of 85 students faculty and friends who came from Trinity School at River Ridge to Rosecrans Memorial Airport in Missouri to experience totality.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6120
6117,Nov. 3 2017 12:24 p.m.,Begging for the Kingdom,One of the third-grade girls tries out the new whiteboard. By Nano Farabaugh Photo: Joan Pingel In August I left South Bend for a few weeks to help Praise Academy at Lakeside start their 2017-18 school year. Things were going well as we prepared for the school’s third year and an increase in enrollment from 13 to 18 students but there was one problem. I’d promised the principal Joan Pingel that I would get some sort of dry-erase board or whiteboard for her small classroom. I hadn’t managed to do that. What should have been a simple task had turned complicated. The layout of the room left only one possible spot for the kind of whiteboard we wanted but none of the standard sizes would fit there. I had discovered there are three types of whiteboard: melamine porcelain and glass. Melamine is cheap but it wears out quickly and tends to get permanent shadows. Porcelain is more expensive longer-lasting and can be magnetized but tempered glass seemed the best choice because it can be cut to any size it will last practically forever and you can use any type of marker. Unfortunately the glass whiteboard that would work best for us costs $1200 and my budget for the project was $100. The situation looked bleak. When I explained things to Paul DeCelles (South Bend) who is school board chairman he said I should simply beg on behalf of the Lord. He said “You are presenting people with an opportunity to be generous to the Lord.” So I contacted several companies explaining that the school is located in the poorest zip code in the state and describing the school’s mission and nonprofit status. My refrain was “What’s the best you can do for me?” The companies basically ignored me. With school about to start I decided I’d better buy an inexpensive whiteboard just so Joan would have something. Paul encouraged me to hit the phones again. Perhaps a local glass company could cut a piece of glass for us drill holes for attaching it and then temper it so it was hard enough. I wasn’t excited about making more calls but I tried six companies in two hours. One employee suggested I call a Shreveport construction firm that works with architectural glass encouraging me to speak to “Charles.” I dutifully called Charles and briefly described the school and our needs. I simply stated the facts. Charles said he couldn’t help but referred me to another firm. While on the phone with that firm (they declined to help) I noticed that Charles was trying to call me. I called him back. He said he’d been thinking about it and he would “take care of it for me” even though it wasn’t the type of glass work they typically did. I still wasn’t sure exactly what he meant so I asked him straight out how much it would cost and he repeated “I can take care of the cost for you.” He even promised to deliver it himself. I was tearing up at that point and told him he was a saint and an answer to prayer. Minutes later when I told the faculty they broke into cheers. Before I left town I made sure I met with Charles to thank him in person. He is a delightful man and we talked about his family his church Praise Academy and the People of Praise. True to his word Charles delivered the new glass whiteboard. It had taken me 20 phone calls hours of research and a bit of humility to “beg on behalf of the Lord” but what was most stunning to me was that I saw close-up how the Lord’s heart is always moved by the poor.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6117
6062,Sept. 6 2017 1:24 p.m.,Neighborhood Missions in Motion,Evansville: Ann held the Hula-Hoop as the girls started the day with some group play before breaking up into age groups. (Chris Vieck) by Chris Meehan After six trips three summer camps myriad work projects and the efforts of more than 500 people the 2017 Action summer is in the books. Here are some numbers and stories: Numbers • More than 310 children attended the summer camps in Evansville Allendale and Indianapolis. Allendale our longest-running camp led the way with 130 campers. • 156 people from 11 branches served as staff interns and volunteers. (In Evansville one of the volunteers was a young man named Xavier Anderson. He grew up in Allendale where he once attended camp.) • Also in Evansville the teams put in 1500 man hours moving 100 tons of dirt to help grade the yards of community members. “Y’all are making it beautiful” one passerby exclaimed. • Two hundred people came to a barbecue in Evansville which featured hamburgers and greens grown in the new start’s urban farm.    Evansville: John Zimmel discussed a Bible story with some of the youngest boys. (Dan Schwab)   Evansville: Anna (far left) and Kady Busekrus (far right) walked with the littlest girls’ group who were on their way to spend some time with Dan Sullivan (Mission Evansville) and learn about compasses and staying on the straight and narrow.

(Dan Schwab)  Evansville: Kady Busekrus (facing camera northern Virginia) and Jessica Davis chatted as they planted seedlings at the urban farm. (Dan Schwab) Stories Addie Clark a sophomore from Portland recalls a story from the camp in Evansville: “After we read about Jesus’ baptism and talked about the meaning of baptism one girl came back the next day and announced that she had asked her mom if she could be baptized. Her mom said ‘Yes!’” Alex Rowland a staff member in Evansville used a comic book Bible for daily lessons with the 12-year-old boys in his camp group. One of the boys asked if he could have a Bible to keep so Alex arranged to give him one. “The Bible was an absolute hit” Alex said. “When the boy returned to camp he had already read halfway through it. He said he had read as much as he could while it was still light.” In Allendale the camp ran very smoothly with so few fights and problems that the boys and girls joined together on the last day for a camp-wide pizza party—“something we would not have attempted in previous years” according to Abby Earhart (Mission Evansville). Three boys from the Allendale camp were playing basketball when three more boys from another neighborhood joined them. John Crimmins (Mission Evansville) saw what happened: “The other boys were getting in the Allendale boys’ faces yelling. The Allendale boys didn’t cuss back. They were peaceful in the face of aggression but not backing down either. It was the Lord working through them.” John invited the three strangers to the barbecue where one of them said that he had noticed that the Allendale boys had been playing with a calmer attitude than he was used to. “We have to be super tough when we play in our neighborhood” the boy said. In Allendale the younger boys had fun pelting an 11-foot-high cardboard Goliath with water balloons while attacking him with swords made from foam and PVC pipe. Brad Elliott (northern Virginia) reports that they used the same swords to knight some of the boys to the service of Jesus Christ. Rachel Was an intern in Indianapolis remembers visiting with an older woman on her front porch who complained of extreme shoulder pain. The woman allowed Rachel and two others to pray with her. They prayed two times and then the woman told them that she felt no pain raising her elbow over her head. “You could tell from her face that the pain had gone away” Rachel said. In Indianapolis the staff ordered sub sandwiches from Walmart for the campers. When Amy Root (Servant Branch) came to pick them up the woman at the counter apologized because she had accidentally put extra meat on all the sandwiches. She explained that there would be no charge for the extra meat. When Amy thanked her and explained who the sandwiches were for the woman realized that her own daughter was attending the camp and would be eating her sandwiches. Ellen Putzier (Mission Indianapolis South Side) reports that in Indianapolis two girls had been unable to make peace with each other. They had gone through the motions of reconciliation but Ellen noticed a deep change when they enacted the roles of the prodigal son and his father in a skit. The girls said their lines with feeling and embraced. “It was strikingly beautiful” Ellen said.  Indianapolis: Some of the girls enjoyed a relay race involving Hula-Hoops.

6068,Sept. 6 2017 11:01 a.m.,People of Praise Members Join International Ecumenical Conversation,Jay Pathak a pastor at Mile High Vineyard Church in Denver Colorado and a member of the John 17 Movement took this picture of Bishop Peter Smith Eric Shreves Pope Francis and Hillary Shreves. by Anne Osterhouse Photo: Jay Pathak Eric and Hilary Shreves and Bishop Peter Smith (all Vancouver-Portland) had the chance of a lifetime in June when they traveled to Rome for a two-hour meeting with Pope Francis. On Thursday June 8 they gathered at the Vatican with a group of about 50 people mostly evangelicals and Pentecostals from the US for a free-flowing discussion punctuated by praise and worship. Most of the participants are part of the John 17 Movement a grassroots Christian unity organization based in Phoenix Arizona. For Eric and Hilary the journey to Rome began with an out-of-the-blue phone call from Josh Butler. Josh is a friend of Eric’s and a pastor at Imago Dei Community an evangelical church in Portland. In a joking way Josh explained that he had tickets to a party he wanted to invite Eric and Hilary to—a special party with Pope Francis. They had two days to decide—two days to arrange childcare and reshuffle their work schedules. The Vancouver-Portland branch and People of Praise headquarters agreed to pay for their trip as well as for Peter’s. Josh had met Pope Francis once before at a similar meeting in 2016. There he had offered what he called a “confession” to Pope Francis explaining that while he had been involved with a network of evangelical churches in Portland he had not done much to build bridges with Catholic brothers and sisters. As Josh recounted Pope Francis “got a large smile on his face and blessed me.” Inspired by that experience Josh had returned to Portland and called Eric a Catholic and the two had met several times for coffee and meals. Eric had introduced Josh to Peter and to Joel Kibler (also Vancouver-Portland) and Josh in turn had invited Peter and other Catholic leaders to a gathering at his church. All of that led up to Josh’s invitation on the phone. At the meeting Pope Francis sat on a cushioned metal chair like all the other participants. He began by saying he didn’t have a speech prepared but hoped for an open candid conversation. The meeting itself was private with no Vatican press release summarizing its contents. “Pope Francis talked a lot about Christian unity” Eric said. “He said the first thing we need to do is pray together. Don’t underestimate the power of petitionary prayer!” During the meeting Josh had a chance to update Pope Francis on the steps he had taken in Portland to build unity. Aside from meeting with Francis the John 17 group spent several days together getting to know one another and sharing about their personal experiences of ecumenism. “I left Rome so incredibly grateful for our ecumenical life in the People of Praise and for what the Lord is doing with ecumenism on a broader scale in the world” Hilary said. “We found ourselves sharing a lot about our practical life in the People of Praise about how ecumenism works in women’s groups and in sharings at community meetings. People really wanted to hear about our life together.” Josh says that he expects the ecumenical conversation in Portland to continue. “God’s movement can be unpredictable. I’m excited to see what’s coming next.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6068
6066,Sept. 6 2017 11:01 a.m.,Ecumenism Highlighted During Celebration of 50th Anniversary of Charismatic Renewal,by Elizabeth Pease Photo: Elizabeth Pease Thirty thousand people from 128 countries came to Rome in June to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Catholic charismatic renewal and I got to be one of them. I traveled there with Angie Hass (Mission Indianapolis) and met up with community members from Colorado Springs Indianapolis and Servant Branch. I know there were brothers and sisters from Buffalo and Appleton there too. I’d heard that Pope Francis had wanted the celebration to have an ecumenical emphasis and it was moving to see many signs of a renewed interest in unity. On Thursday sitting on the marble floors of stunning Byzantine and Renaissance churches I heard stories of ecumenism. Giovanni Traettino an Italian Pentecostal shared about washing the feet of a Catholic after years of tense relations between Catholics and Pentecostals in Italy. Charles Whitehead a friend of Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan (South Bend) described a long process of regular meetings and conversations among the leaders of all of the Christian churches in his English village. On Friday morning I attended a panel discussion on ecumenism in a lecture hall designed to seat about 200. It started late. The emcee came to the microphone and explained that there were 2000 people waiting outside. “We didn’t anticipate how much interest there would be in this topic” she said. The conference culminated in two long evenings spent outdoors at the Circus Maximus. Everywhere I looked there was some new expression of joy—a young man standing on his chair with hands raised and tears streaming down his face nuns in white habits forming a dance line a row of Brazilian teenagers yelling out “Viva Brasil!” A highlight came on Friday night when a video about the origins of the Catholic charismatic renewal played on the JumboTron. I looked up and suddenly Kevin and Dorothy appeared on the screen 20 feet tall. Though the Ranaghans had been unable to come to Rome in the flesh God found a way to bring them there that was truly larger than life. On Saturday night Pope Francis joined us raising his hands in praise. “[The Catholic charismatic renewal] was born ecumenical” he said. “It was born ecumenical because it is the Holy Spirit who creates unity and the same Spirit who granted the inspiration for this.” He added “Today Christian unity is more urgent than ever Christians united by the power of the Holy Spirit in prayer and in activity on behalf of the most vulnerable.” Visiting Assisi after the conference we were walking back to the hotel when I said “Praise the Lord!” Unexpectedly “Praise the Lord!” echoed back from a man sitting on the steps of a nearby building. We were soon in a conversation about ecumenism with a small group of Catholic Jamaicans from New York City. I explained that as a charismatic even though I’m Catholic I think that of some of my spiritual heritage comes from Christians of other denominations. Without some of the Pentecostal revivals in the United States in the last century the Catholic Charismatic Renewal would not exist. My new Jamaican friend shook his head and smiled. “You’re blowin’ my mind sister!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6066

As planning for a new floor began Mike Gionfriddo the athletic director championed the idea of using a parquet pattern. He had in mind the famous floor designed in 1946 for the old Boston Garden where Larry Bird—a basketball legend who grew up in Indiana—once swished his shots. For Greenlawn’s new floor Mike hoped for a unique look for something with “a wow factor a nice pop.” Standing on that new floor today you can see the colors popping. Thousands of maple boards their hues ranging from dark to nearly blonde catch the light and gleam like the glazed tiles of a mosaic. Each about an inch wide the boards are arranged in 3’ by 3’ sections. The direction of the boards changes from one section to the next creating the same kind of checkerboard look that the old Garden had. Throw in the painted green stripes that adorn Trinity’s new floor and the visual similarity is unmistakable. (This surely raises a question in the minds of Greenlawn sports fans: If you build it. . . will the next Larry come?) This beautiful court would not have been possible without the generosity of more than 200 Greenlawn parents alumni friends and community members who rallied like a championship team after a big loss. “The court is a huge gift from the Lord” said John Lee Greenlawn’s head of school. “I want people to know how grateful we are to everyone who participated in the fundraising effort.”* * *As 7.65 inches of water descended on South Bend on August 16 2016 city streets became like swift-running rivers. Basements filled up like swimming pools and chickens drowned. No one saw what happened that night at the branch’s community center a modest facility that is also the athletic center for Trinity Greenlawn. The most likely story is that a torrent of water formed in a neighborhood to the north then surged through a culvert that runs below the Indiana Toll Road. The water swamped a retention pond then swept across the center’s parking lot and through the building’s lower level like a mighty tide.  Several inches of rainwater caused the old floor to buckle. The next morning Paul Barrett the facilities manager found sopping carpet on the indoor soccer field and half an inch to an inch of water on the gym floor. On the exterior walls he noticed a waterline between six and eight inches high. Then on a grassy area south of the building he found thousands of small fish even one six-inch bluegill deposited there by the wave of water. “I was almost in shock” he said. A contractor arrived later that day with heaters blowers and dehumidifiers hoping to save the gym floor. But within a few days the floorboards had swelled unglued themselves and buckled forming a series of wooden waves. In the soccer arena the carpet had to be cut up and thrown away. The contractor did manage to dry out the branch center’s first floor and keep mildew from growing. Leaders at the school and in the South Bend branch soon learned that the building’s general insurance did not cover flood damage and there was no flood insurance since the building does not lie in a flood plain. At Trinity John Lee and John Kurdelak the school’s director of advancement had already planned a fall fundraiser to raise $200000 for scholarships that Greenlawn families count on to help pay for tuition. To pay for a new floor they estimated they would need to raise an additional $150000. “We’ve never had to raise that much money in a single year” John Lee said. The need for the floor became even more obvious once the basketball season began. Mike Gionfriddo had succeeded in securing four practice times each week at the gym of Stanley Clark a local private school and in scheduling home games at another gym owned by the Salvation Army. Between the extra driving and the lack of a home court morale took a hit. “It was like all games were away games” said Eli Thomas a junior on the varsity team. A big breakthrough came in February when the Community Foundation of St. Joseph County announced that it would hold a Give Local Day on May 9. On that day 67 local nonprofit organizations would run simultaneous fundraisers as well as compete for money from a pool of matching funds the foundation offered. The rules state that 25% of the money raised by each organization must remain in an endowment fund held by the Community Foundation for that organization. This meant the school needed to increase its goal from $150000 to $200000. John Kurdelak began talking to his contacts including a friend of Trinity School who offered to give $100000 in matching funds. The donor chose to remain anonymous. “It was a very humble a very generous gift” John Kurdelak said. “We are extremely grateful.” The matching gift created more momentum for the project and John and his team worked intensely to get the word out. On May 9 the gifts came pouring in: $119000 from Greenlawn’s families alumni friends and community members plus the $100000 from the anonymous benefactor. Later the Community Foundation kicked in an additional $80632 in matching funds bringing Greenlawn’s overall total to nearly $300000. “It was easily the most the school has ever received through a single giving event” John Kurdelak said.* * *The search for a vendor to install the new floor began and Connor Sports one of the nation’s leading installers was already in the area working to install floors at Notre Dame. The company submitted a competitive bid and won the contract. Bruce Haroldson who has put in floors for the Olympics and for the Final Four college basketball championships came to put in the parquet floor for Greenlawn.  The adjustable goals provide fans more space to walk around the court. In addition to the floor six new adjustable basketball goals now hang from the ceiling. Two teams can practice on the court simultaneously and fans have more space to walk from the entryway to the bleachers. Trinity still has some money left over which will be used to pay for a study that will examine the best way to improve the soccer arena. A plan is also in the works to prevent future flooding. “We’re going to make physical changes to ensure that this kind of damage doesn’t happen again” said Mike Zusi who leads the community’s property office. “And we now have flood insurance.” So when the school year starts Greenlawn basketball players will be doing their best Larry Bird impersonations swishing shots on their new court. In basketball lingo that means it will be raining buckets. It’s a good thing we have flood insurance.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6060

5970,July 12 2017 10:03 p.m.,“God Wants You to Know What It’s Like”,People of Praise missionary Chris Vieck. by Chris Vieck Photos: Joe Gleason Mary Timler Dan Sullivan Editor’s note: Chris Vieck is a missionary in the new start in Evansville. She is a member of the Sisterhood. We moved onto the corner of Linwood and Madison in Evansville on Good Friday 2012. Right onto the toughest corner of one of the toughest neighborhoods in town. One of our neighbors told us “You’re moving right into the heart of the hood.” I knew that the Lord had given us those houses and given us that strategic location but I didn’t realize that he was also going to give me opportunities to experience what life is really like for our neighbors there. I grew up on a farm near Vincennes Indiana. Our large family always had enough money and more than enough friends. From there I went to college in South Bend joined the People of Praise and shortly thereafter became part of the Sisterhood. Because of my education and background I knew how to speak and behave in such a way that I would be treated with respect. And I always had been.   The intersection of Linwood and Madison in Evansville was once referred to as “Devil’s Corner” because it was the site of so many fights and drug deals. Soon after our household of sisters moved onto the corner we started getting sick. We’d been cleaning our rental house for days but we couldn’t get rid of the stench. Was it old urine? Mold? Or worse had someone been making meth there? We didn’t know. We just knew that we’d been using gallons of bleach but the odor in the house was so strong you couldn’t even smell any bleach. We spent two weeks in South Bend while the missionary brothers worked on fixing the problem for us. New cabinets and countertops ductwork cleaned a new ceiling black mold removed and a repaired furnace later the problem was fixed. It turned out that thousands upon thousands of cockroach carcasses (thankfully long dead) were responsible for that sickening smell. That was a first taste of what it’s like but unlike our neighbors we had the manpower and means to fix it. Once the smell was gone I was so eager to be in the neighborhood. I slept like a baby that first night but within a week I started waking up in the middle of the night anxious and afraid. I didn’t know why. I thought it was the enemy so after our neighborhood women’s group one night I asked for prayers. During the prayer Netesha got a word from the Lord: “God wants you to know what it’s like for women in this neighborhood only they don’t know how to fight.” When she said that I remembered hearing neighbors talk about what sounded to me like paranoia at night. Netesha was right they didn’t know how to fight how to pray against the devil. God had given me another taste of what our neighbors’ life is like but unlike them I had the means to fight. After the prayer I went back to sleeping soundly. A year or two later on a warm summer afternoon I went to visit Mary who lives a few houses down from us. I had been talking with Carrie Johnson when I realized I was supposed to meet Mary at one o’clock. She didn’t answer the door so I started jogging back to Carrie’s house. While I was running a shiny white SUV pulled up next to me. The driver was wearing a White Sox cap and jersey. He yelled at me “Hey come over here! It’s the police!” I thought no way! All I could think of were stories I had heard of men impersonating police officers and abducting women so I kept going. He kept yelling at me and finally he flashed a set of police lights and blared the siren for a second. So I stopped. I still didn’t know what was going on but I was cornered. He got out of the car and flashed a badge. Again I thought of the stories I had heard: don’t believe a flashed badge. Right away a shiny black sports car pulled up as well and that guy got out too. The first guy yelled at me “I told you we’re US marshals! When I say stop you stop!” I wish I’d had the presence of mind to say to them “Do you know what neighborhood you’re in accosting a woman like this?” But it all happened so quickly I couldn’t think straight. Two of the missionary brothers Evan Lent and Joe Cassell had seen the whole thing from their house and they tried to approach me to help out but the second marshal kept them back. They couldn’t get closer to me than 30 feet. I was totally alone and I was so confused. What was going on? Why were they stopping me? What had I done wrong? Why was he yelling at me? The first marshal started grilling me and he was very aggressive. I was so intimidated. “Why were you running? What’s your name? Who were you visiting? What were you doing there?” I told him I was a Christian missionary and I was going to see Mary on a mission visit. He said “How do you know her? Do you know that she’s wanted?” I knew she was on probation but I didn’t know she was wanted. My heart sank at the thought that this woman who had been working on turning her life around might have committed another crime. He kept questioning me. I felt totally powerless. I couldn’t get anywhere or talk to anyone. They could have easily taken me away. I’d never been so intimidated accused disrespected and completely unable to defend myself. The angry questioning went on for a while and finally the marshals decided that my story was legitimate and I couldn’t help them find Mary so they both left. I was surprised by how shaken and confused I was by the experience. I still didn’t know what had happened or why it had happened to me.  The house the missionary men live in which houses the main kitchen dining room and meeting room for all the missionaries. That evening we had a prayer meeting at our house. Afterwards some of the sisters were praying over one another. I still felt pretty shaken so I decided to ask for prayers. When they started praying over me one of the neighborhood women Tyresha got a word from the Lord. She said “God wants you to know what it’s like.” After she spoke her word I remembered that Tyresha had been in jail. She had spent some years in prison. God was allowing me some share in our neighbors’ experience of life. Later on Mary found out what had happened to me. She told me that when I knocked on her door she was in the waiting room at the probation office hoping to explain her plan for catching up on her probation payments. She hadn’t committed any new crimes and it really didn’t make any sense that they would have sent the marshals after her: she’d been sitting right in their office for hours! I think there’s something of the Incarnation in these experiences. Jesus already knows what it’s like to live in these houses to be one of the neighbors to experience fear sleepless nights and disrespect. He’s letting us feel what he feels which is what our neighbors feel. I thank God for giving me some share in the experience of our neighbors’ lives. He’s given me a gift. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5970

There were also 13 local boys who attended without their fathers some of whom are being raised by single mothers. “For at least the third year now we have asked the local house of the Missionaries of Charity to suggest some boys from their rough neighborhood who would benefit from such an event” Joseph Mutidjo said. Kevin Rodriguez added that the goal of the campout is “to provide the opportunity for boys and young men to spend time with positive role models whether their fathers or men in the People of Praise.”   A Saturday morning tradition at camp: calisthenics led by Locksley Robinson.  Five young men associated with the Missionaries of Charity (pictured with branch member Kevin Rowe and two other boys) came to camp this year.  A marl quarry captured the boys’ interest during the Saturday morning hike.  Campers celebrated the opening of the Lord’s Day.

5975,July 12 2017 10:02 p.m.,Having a Ball in South Bend,by Chris Meehan Photos: Margaret Anderson The South Bend branch’s soccer program began some 20 years ago when Rich and Beth Preuss noticed they were spending many hours transporting their children to and from soccer practices and games. Rich imagined a different kind of soccer experience one where children of different ages played in a single location where the focus was on fun and learning rather than on winning games an experience that would harmonize with community and family life. He credits Katy McShane a covenanted sister who died in 2010 with helping him get the program off the ground.  This year 26 adults and teenagers coached around 40 boys and girls grades K-6 two times a week during the month-long program. Third-grader Justin Heintzelman says “I really like scrimmaging even when it’s difficult like when I have to play against my older brother Josh!”    Boys and girls appreciate the individual attention they get from the coaches as well as the shorter-than-normal fields.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5975
5977,July 6 2017 3:45 p.m.,Building Furniture in the Scarred Heart of Milwaukee,"Coleman Moore (left) and Rus Lyons inside their shop at Adullam Outreach in Milwaukee. by Sean Connolly This is a follow up to our fall 2016 story on The Custom Cottage a furniture shop in Grand Rapids Michigan started by Coleman Moore. Coleman a former pastor turned furniture builder employs ex-cons alcoholics drug addicts homeless men and veterans and trains them to become craftsmen.  Rus Lyons moved to Grand Rapids in May of 2016 beginning the training that he hoped would eventually equip him to open a furniture shop in Evansville. He began by building bunk beds then grappled with the subtleties of painting staining and applying polyurethane. He pulled a couple of all-nighters in the shop thinking about the long hours Jesus spent working with his hands. One day Coleman was at the chop saw. He turned to Rus and said simply ""I love building."" For Rus his words were a revelation. “My heart began burning” Rus said. “I thought to myself God just loves making things. He is a creator a craftsman.” Meanwhile Coleman and his wife Mary were preparing to move to North Carolina. Coleman had already trained a partner to run the Grand Rapids shop and he wanted to open a second Custom Cottage in Asheville not far from his native Tennessee mountains. He dreamed of a retirement where he could pass his days building furniture pausing to talk and pray with his fellow builders. In North Carolina Coleman came close to leasing two different pieces of property. The first he called “ideal” and the second “even more perfect” with mountain views and all the infrastructure he needed. But the deals fell through at the last moment and Coleman returned to Michigan empty-handed. Then in August of 2016 Coleman’s son Bobby 30 a youth pastor went with a group of middle school students on a mission trip to Milwaukee. They visited a former millwork factory on the city’s north side the home of Adullam Outreach. Adullam named for the cave where King David sought refuge from his would-be killers is an oasis in a neighborhood where gunshots ring out day and night. (The day before I visited Adullam two women were shot in broad daylight a few blocks away.) When Bobby walked into the old factory he heard God speak to him: I have something for you here. His nerves jangled. Was God calling him to move to Milwaukee to make a donation or something else? Steve Grabosh a former Christian punk rocker with flowing red dreadlocks one of Adullam’s founders led Bobby and the youth group on a tour of the 30000-square-foot former factory. He showed them the second floor where Adullam held weekly prayer meetings and the Relief Center where volunteers distribute mattresses and furniture to fire victims and evicted families. Then he took them into a wood shop full of professional-grade tools. Steve and others at Adullam had dreamed of launching a job-training program in the shop but the vision hadn’t come to fruition and the tools had gone largely unused.  In the wood shop at Adullam Outreach in Milwaukee even the lockers preach the good news. Standing in the wood shop God spoke to Bobby again: This is it this is what I have for you to do. He prayed then set up a meeting with Steve telling him about Coleman and The Custom Cottage. He also met Al Caldecourt a retired engineer and furniture builder who had brought the tools to Adullam hoping one day to build furniture there. With his wife Terri Al had dedicated thousands of hours to improving the building updating the electrical service sheet-rocking and adding bathrooms crossing items off an unending to-do list. Back home in Michigan Bobby told his father in no uncertain terms that God wanted Coleman to get in touch with Al and Steve. “Milwaukee wasn’t on our radar” Coleman said. “My whole heart and soul was on south of the Mason Dixon line.” But the father took his son’s words seriously. He made phone calls and began to pray about the situation in Milwaukee. A few days later on August 13 2016 a Milwaukee police officer shot Sylville Smith a young African-American man about 10 blocks from Adullam. That night rioters burned police cars and a gas station making national news. Coleman heard about it and his heart was moved. He learned that the 53206 zip code just a few blocks away has the highest incarceration rate in the country—just 36 percent of working age males have jobs. “It was a sign that this place needs The Custom Cottage more than Asheville does” he said. Coleman put together a business proposal. He asked Adullam to charge The Custom Cottage only for their expenses until the business began to turn a profit. Adullam accepted the proposal and also gave the Moores free rent in a flat they owned nearby. After praying about it Rus accepted an offer from Coleman to join him in Milwaukee sensing an opportunity to build a business from the ground up without taking on the financial risks of ownership. The Moores and Rus moved to Milwaukee in early December. Coleman and Mary traded their 3500-square-foot home on a country lake for a two-bedroom flat in North Milwaukee. The three of them lived beneath a feuding couple and one night the woman screamed and jumped from the second story to get away from her lover. Another night the Moores were surprised to hear a torrent of automatic weapons fire—then they remembered it was New Year’s Eve. Rus and Coleman worked together to set up the shop building a paint booth and establishing relationships with suppliers. While traveling back to Michigan to get their first load of wood the SUV Coleman was driving blew a head gasket which proved a fatal blow for that vehicle. Soon after Rus received a pickup truck donated by a friend from Minnesota. “It had no problem hauling 3000 pounds of wood” Rus said. Coleman and Rus built furniture for the showroom put ads on Craigslist and filled their first customer order in January. By April Rus had accepted an offer from Coleman to manage the shop. Coleman is still there finishing pieces while Rus deals with customers and builds furniture. Coleman and Rus say they are on track to hire their first local employee soon. Ever the missionary Rus visits neighbors on his lunch breaks praying with them and talking to them about the Lord. He says that the neighbors including some of the young men are “very open to the Lord.” Coleman and Mary both say that Rus has been indispensable. “We would not have been able to do what we’ve done without Rus here” Mary said. When I visited the shop in March Coleman and Rus paused for lunch joining with Al and Terri who continue to work at improving the old factory. The group ate and talked together in a spirit of community the same way the builders had always done in Grand Rapids. Al admitted that it hasn’t always been easy to see The Custom Cottage operating in the shop he’d set up. “I wanted to be that furniture builder. I wanted to make that happen—but that was just me.” And yet he says “I am throwing my lot in with them because I think that is what God wants.” Like Coleman Mary Rus and Steve Al has been surprised by all that God has achieved. A year ago none of them had dared to think that there would be a furniture shop open for business in the scarred heart of Milwaukee. Yet now inside the old factory amid the hum of sanders and the buzzing of saws there is no denying that Al’s tools are finally being put to good use. Soon they will be fulfilling their new mission building lives by building furniture.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5977

Charles is a friend of Dorothy and Kevin Ranaghan’s and sends his warmest greetings to the People of Praise. In reference to making real friends in other denominations Bishop Larkin said “When you live together you can’t do anything else but be changed.” “Your Protestant or Pentecostal friend who lives next door is your brother or sister in Christ” Charles Whitehead a Catholic said. Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa the preacher to the papal household also spoke about ecumenism. He shared his own experience with first encountering the charismatic renewal and said that the love necessary for unity came with his own experience of baptism in the Holy Spirit in 1977. “[Pope Francis] had a prophetic idea. He wanted to give this conference an ecumenical side because I am convinced he is moved by the spirit” Fr. Cantalamessa also said. I’m so moved by all this talk of ecumenism. Some appear to be hearing it for the first time and are asking how they can explain ecumenism to their leaders and priests at home. They’re asking how they can possibly live with Christians of other denominations when there’s so much history of division. I’m in awe of the People of Praise and want to find some way to share the tools and experience we have with all of them.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5929

Among them are People of Praise members from locations including Indianapolis Colorado Springs Buffalo and the Twin Cities including our own Vine & Branches reporter Elizabeth Pease. Today the group attended an audience with Pope Francis who greeted the pilgrims. “On your families I invoke a rich outpouring of the gifts of the Holy Spirit” he said. Pope Francis will join the charismatics again on Pentecost Sunday for a mass in St. Peter’s square. As the Catholic Charismatic Renewal had an ecumenical dimension from the beginning Pope Francis wanted the anniversary celebration also to be ecumenical inviting Pentecostals and evangelicals from around the world. Some of the conference sessions will specifically focus on spiritual ecumenism. “You Charismatics have a special grace to pray and work for Christian unity so that the current of grace may pass through all Christian Churches” Pope Francis said in 2015.

5860,May 19 2017 12:51 p.m.,Building a (Modular) House in Evansville,Neighbors watched in the drizzling rain as the 80-foot-tall crane lifted the four modules of the new home of Orest and Susan Holovaty one by one and set them in place. By Chris Meehan Photos: Mary Timler On March 23 in a drizzling rain community members gathered on the sidewalk with cups of coffee and cinnamon rolls to watch the raising of the first new modular house in the Evansville new start. It took about five hours. Around 8:00 a.m. a crew arrived from Heckaman homes in Nappanee Indiana to unload the four modules built in the Heckaman factory that would make up the two-story 1800-square-foot home.   Orest and Susan Holovaty An 80-foot crane lifted the two first-floor modules and set them in place on the foundation then the second-floor went on and finally crew members raised the roof which had arrived flat attached on its outer edges to the second-floor modules. Orest and Susan Holovaty who moved from South Bend in August 2016 own the house and plan to move in later this spring. The house went up with all the speed and efficiency of an Amish barn raising but planning had taken many months. Linwood Construction a company started by Paul Hommes and John Earhart was the builder. Paul is a mechanical engineer by training who has studied the costs and benefits of traditional houses (built on site) as well as two types of houses built off-site: manufactured and modular. “As we looked at the type of houses we wanted to build in Evansville we saw a number of advantages to modular houses which are made in sections. The construction is flexible so that you can add a second story or adapt the floor plan to have a door on the short end. The modules constructed on wood frames in a factory with all the wiring plumbing flooring and appliances already in place can be quickly stacked and arranged in a variety of ways and they are less expensive than a site-built house.” The community has built both traditional and manufactured houses in Allendale but this is the first use of modular housing in a new start.  Orest says that he and Susan put considerable thought into the floor plan and appearance of the house. “Having space for hospitality was an important factor in our planning but we also didn’t want to build something that would seem ostentatious. We wanted to build a house that could conceivably come within the price range of a local resident in the future.” In February when the time came for breaking ground two experts had arrived: Gerry Orthmann (Yakima) and Chris Taylor (Corvallis). Both are retired carpenters and contractors with 90 years of experience between them. Gerry and Chris have helped with other projects in Evansville Indianapolis and Allendale but this time they wanted to do more than lend a hand. “We wanted to share what we know with others so many more people can help build cities for the Lord” Chris said.  Paul Hommes (left) president of Linwood Construction and John Earhart (right) Linwood’s business manager took a moment with Scott Syers of Heckaman Homes the manufacturer of the modules. To that end Chris and Gerry spent eight days teaching Paul John and four other brothers from Indianapolis Allendale and Evansville how to dig and pour a foundation. After Chris and Gerry completed the foundation for the Holovatys’ house teaching as they went along they supervised as the six younger men built the foundation for a second house by themselves. The second house will be for the missionary sisters with modules scheduled to arrive on May 9. “The guys soaked up all we could teach them like a sponge” Gerry said. “They had a great aptitude for the work and it’s always a blast being with the missionaries.” Both teachers and students hope there will be more teaching trips like this. “Chris and Gerry were terrific to work with” Paul said. “Both have been really helpful with their comments and input. I learned a lot just by watching them work.” “We saved thousands of dollars by having their assistance” Orest added.  The day before the house was set in place an advance team from Heckaman had come to map out the exact delivery route for the modules which would arrive on two trucks with 65-foot beds. For ease of construction and transportation modules are connected in pairs by sheets of oriented strand board so before the crane could lift the modules a crew member used a chainsaw to separate them. The gabled roof came in two pieces each of which was already shingled and attached on one side to one of the second-story modules. As the first half of the roof was lifted up from the module below the roof truss unfolded to hold it up while the other side of the roof was lifted to meet it. The crane dropped a series of triangular cap pieces along the ridge and then the basic structure of the house was complete. A few days later a crew arrived from Heckaman to make the house livable. They finished the exterior siding and shingling the parts that could only be worked on after the house had been set in place. On the inside as typically happens when the modules travel their frames had shifted a bit creating cracks in the drywall near windows. Those needed to be patched. The exterior door frames and interior doorways had also gone askew in the move. Various gaps had to be filled and edges needed smoothing.  The Holovatys saved money by installing their own stove refrigerator and living room flooring and by painting the interior walls which had been primed at the factory. Linwood Construction arranged for licensed electricians to connect the house to the local electric utility and a plumber to connect to local water gas and sewer lines. An HVAC contractor installed the furnace air-conditioning equipment and some ductwork. “So far the neighbors have been warm and supportive of the construction” said Nick Holovaty. “I think the sight of us guys with shovels digging the foundations showed the neighbors that we are doing it ourselves and that we’re here to stay. One neighbor keeps telling us ‘I’m proud of you. You’re doing a great job.’”  For more on our new modular homes in Evansville including video clips of the modules being set in place see these stories: Second Modular House Arrives in Evansville New Homes in Evansville Construction in Evansville,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5860
5858,May 17 2017 1:31 p.m.,Meet the Board: Sean Connolly,Sean and Gretchen Connolly with their four children. by Bill Crimmins Photo: Joe Gleason One minute! The clock read three hours eleven minutes as the man in the “Christ in you” t-shirt completed the 2016 Twin Cities Marathon. Twenty-six straight sub-7:30 minute miles. No mean feat. But one minute short of qualifying for Boston the father of road races. To qualify—and he will qualify—he has to do it all over again. One minute!  *** Sean Connolly (South Bend) is the board of governors’ newest member elected in 2016 to a six-year term. Program coordinator for communications he oversees the People of Praise website directs publication of Vine & Branches authors e-mail news blasts and works with Greenlawn Films on the video productions you may see from time to time. His motto: “See the Lord and make him known.” Overall Coordinator Craig Lent calls Sean a “student of communication” an “ideas and words guy” whose work for the community is “invaluable.” *** Sean’s devotion to running dates to high school. In the fall of 1994 as a junior he came to the South Bend branch community celebration 10K race thinking: “I’m gonna win this thing!” At the start he noticed another runner in serious gear and realized he might have a race on his hands. He set the pace but could not shake his man. Neck and neck most of the way Sean finally out-kicked him at the end. His rival Paul Langenfeld (Servant Branch) dogged Sean after the race as he had during it. Paul reached out to befriend Sean who initially “blew him off.” But his persistence paid off and they began to run together. Paul related to Sean as to an adult encouraged him prayed with him. As Sean recalls “it was the start of my adult Christianity.” *** Sean’s head Paul DeCelles (South Bend) oversees the work of the program offices. He notes that Sean has pastoral responsibility for a group of about 20 adults plus children living in and around the Greenlawn campus who support the program offices in what is called “the work college.” In addition to the “phenomenal amount of work” Sean undertakes Paul says he has “a fantastic pastoral touch” helping foster a “striking degree of unity.” He is Paul says “a peacemaker very wise.” *** After graduating from Trinity at Greenlawn Sean spent four years at Notre Dame came underway and earned a B.A. in philosophy. He was a member of the planning team for the community’s second High Country Adventure as a result of which youth ministry was transformed into an opportunity for younger brothers and sisters to do hard things to build homes cities and to preach good news to the poor. Helping lead this transformation Sean Nick Holovaty (Mission program coordinator Evansville) and J-T Kelly (Mission division Indianapolis) were commissioned to search for a place our high school students could hold a summer camp. A road trip brought them to Shreveport where they asked a game son of the branch to drive them to “the worst part of town.” They were soon after turning off Murphy Street onto Yale Avenue. Sean was among the first brave souls to move to Allendale building houses and friendships with neighbors challenging defiant teenagers on those first Action summers to live radically for the Lord and heading the first household of men and women there as they put their wallets where their mouths were. In 2005 he returned to South Bend to begin work as a writer and acting publisher for Vine & Branches. In 2009 he married Gretchen Rolland another of those brave souls part of that first household and a fellow worker in communications. The two are now six. Full-time work broad pastoral duties a family and if that’s not enough his sights set on Boston… so if you happen to wander onto South Ellsworth Place a block east of Greenlawn on an April afternoon a warm spring rain falling you might see an athlete out for some serious training with the three oldest kids in tow. No umbrella no raincoats. “Okay kids a quick sprint down to the corner and back. Let’s see just how soaked we can get.” The little ones giggle as the four squish off through the lawn. And that must be Gretchen holding the baby shaking her head and smiling. Sean looks back: “Serious training going on here serious. Right kids? . . . just give us one minute.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5858
5837,May 17 2017 1:31 p.m.,Healy Group: Built on Little Things,"Healy Group owners (from left) Tony Nyers Rich Preuss Chris Rowland Matt Urbanski and Randy Raciti. by Sean Connolly Photos: Christin Rose Margaret Anderson With this article which tells the stories of Rich Preuss Randy Raciti Chris Rowland and Matt Urbanski (all South Bend) four of the owners of Healy Group we are beginning a series on entrepreneurs in the community. If you have a suggestion for a future story in this series please contact us at [email protected] ""You can be the best financial advisor in the world but if you don’t have a client it doesn’t matter. You’ll starve to death.” Rich Preuss a financial advisor and an owner of Healy Group in South Bend is telling me about the days when he cut his teeth as a salesman. In 1982 Rich was a young man with a master’s degree in theology who wanted to become a stockbroker. After Merrill Lynch rejected him Ed Healy a life insurance agent offered Rich a job. (Rich went on to marry Ed’s daughter Beth though Ed didn’t know about their budding relationship when he hired Rich.)   Rich Preuss The job involved lots of cold calling. “Ed gave me these 3x5 Dun & Bradstreet cards which listed a business its owner and the sales of the company and he said ‘Call these people.’” He aimed to make 50 calls each week. On the phone he would ask for a face-to-face meeting. If he got a yes he’d bring along an experienced salesman and listen to the pitch studying points of tension and connection. “Trying to get new clients is brutal psychologically” he says. “When I started out I probably thought about quitting every day for the first five years.” He put his hope in a formula—if he made 10 calls he could get two or three meetings and land one client. It was the spirit of Babe Ruth the baseball legend who set the record for home runs while simultaneously setting the record for strikeouts. “So much of building a business and getting clients comes down to what you do each day” he says. “It’s a matter of calling people and doing the little things. As the saying goes when you do the little things the big things take care of themselves.”***   Joe Cramer Built on the little things Healy Group is much larger today than it was in the 1980s—with 41 employees spread across four divisions. The life insurance work that Rich began with morphed into a broader financial planning division employing Rich Randy Raciti and Matt Urbanski plus community members Christin Rose Joe Cramer Linda Mooney and Claire Mysliwiec and five other employees. Chris Rowland leads a separate division with 12 employees focused on employee benefits. Another community member Tim Pingel works in the insurance division. The mortgage division is led by Mike Morin a Trinity School at Greenlawn parent.  Linda Mooney Growth did not come fast but it has accelerated recently. “It took us 23 years to get to 10 employees” says Randy Healy Group’s president noting that in 2015 the company added 10 employees in a single year. In 2014 they moved into their new 12000-square-foot office building which they designed with extra space so that growth can continue.  Pam Shultz *** Randy started at Healy in 1987. The son of a salesman and entrepreneur who died when Randy was 13 Randy always wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps as a businessman. But by 1987 his career had reached a turning point so he took a walk with Joel Kibler (Vancouver-Portland). “I have this sense that you and Rich Preuss should be working together” Joel told Randy who applied for a job at Healy. He started by selling employee benefits packages and helping individual clients with financial planning. Randy is a dogged worker—as a young man he would rise at 4:00 a.m. and work until midnight then get up and do it all over again. He’s also a born salesman. “I am very comfortable picking up the phone and introducing myself” he says. In 1990 Randy entered a leadership program and when the classes ended he contacted all 45 of his classmates. “Presidents of banks presidents of hospitals presidents of media companies— I contacted them all. I didn’t know any better. I was 29 years old so why not?” On the phone he would offer to take his prospect out to breakfast or lunch. Then over the meal Randy would spend most of the time perhaps 40 minutes listening to his prospect’s story waiting patiently until the final 10 minutes when he would tell his own story and offer his services. He and Rich were both aggressive about adding new clients. “One year we had a little personal competition for how many new people we could meet with in the course of a year and I think we both blew through the 200 new people mark” Randy says.  Claire Mysliwiec enjoyed a Dairy Queen Dilly Bar provided by Tim Pingel known for offering ice cream treats to his fellow employees. To help their clients Randy and Rich began using a software program to forecast the amount clients needed to save for retirement. Most appointments were outside the office so they would bring a 70- or 80-page printed report with scenarios and projections. Inevitably the client would want to alter the variables—to see the impact of saving more or working longer— so the advisor had to return to the office and rerun the numbers. “That created frustration for us and for the client” Rich says. Over time the software improved and Rich and Randy began meeting with clients at the Healy Group office where they could run projections on the spot. They also started using a more comprehensive planning process analyzing a client’s overall level of protection debt savings and investments. With a more complete picture they noticed ways to save the client money. By 1999 Randy’s efforts had begun to blossom and he wanted to go full-time as a financial planner. Enter Chris Rowland. *** Chris had been working in employee benefits since 1985 when he graduated from Notre Dame with his M.B.A. As an undergrad he had majored in philosophy but had developed an interest in business. In graduate school he first learned about the up-and-coming field of employee benefits. A young married man he saw a chance to do good for people while also providing for his family. He worked for two different companies in South Bend before joining Healy in 1999 to take over and eventually expand Randy’s employee benefits portfolio. “The mindset that we’re helping build the kingdom of God when we take care of people that we’ll go above and beyond the call of duty—that attracted me” Chris says. Employee benefits work has different rhythms from financial planning. Most of Chris’s clients are businesses—small companies nonprofits and larger corporations. Chris and his staff of 12 act as middle men between the companies who sell group health life and disability insurance packages and the companies providing insurance to their employees. They negotiate contracts offer ideas and answer questions. Health insurance costs are always rising and regulations changing so a lot of the work Chris and his team does is educational—teaching human resources departments about changes in the marketplace teaching employees about changes to their plans. “We want to work hard for our clients to make sure problems are resolved and that they can afford to offer health insurance to their employees” he says.  Employees at a monthly Fun & Fellowship Friday lunch in Healy’s community room. *** If phone calls and sales efforts are the skeleton of the business then faceto-face client meetings are the heart and soul. They are where the music happens where “we take on our clients’ problems as if they’re our own problems” as Chris puts it. Even if the problem is a flat tire. Healy Group employees like to tell the story of a client who rolled into the parking lot on just three good tires. Tim Pingel spotted the flat and in a meeting he and Rich were having with the client Tim asked the client for his keys. He asked at least twice before the surprised client agreed. Tim went out to the parking lot found the jack and spare raised up the metal hulk switched the tire then lowered the minivan back down to the ground while Rich finished meeting with the client.  Employees spiritedly entered into a Friday fun game: identifying fellow employees from their baby pictures. Matt Urbanski tells another story about driving to Bremen Indiana to visit an elderly couple he advises. On the way there he remembered that the husband loves chocolates so he decided to stop at a grocery store and buy some. Praying while he drove he asked the Lord what he thought. Much to Matt’s surprise the Lord prompted him to buy some paczkis instead. (Paczkis are a Polish pastry.) Matt showed up with the paczkis only to learn that the wife had been hankering for some all day. In fact when Matt had called earlier she thought about asking him to bring some but dismissed the idea as too trivial. Later Matt prayed with the husband for arthritis in his hands and the wife for neck pain. Both told him they experienced relief after his prayer. Matt is Healy’s newest owner. He started in 2000 but only after putting off the idea for several years. As a college student in the early 1990s he met with Rich to ask his advice about whether to major in finance or marketing. “I don’t think it matters” Rich told him “because we’ll hire you whatever you major in.” Matt chose marketing worked for a restaurant ownership group then led the development office at Holy Cross College. By 2000 he was ready to try insurance sales and financial planning. He says his first year at Healy did not go well at least by conventional measures. He worked harder than he ever had but he brought in less income than he had in his previous job. (Several years later someone told him that 90 percent of financial advisors quit in their first year.) Matt persisted developing a niche helping young families who wanted life insurance and whose incomes would grow over time giving them more money to invest. He can still recall two phone calls early in his career when he learned that two of his clients both husbands had died in tragic accidents. Matt usually recommends that clients buy enough life insurance so that the payouts could replace the client’s income if the client were to die. Because these clients had followed Matt’s advice Matt knew that the widows would not have to worry much about money. *** Matt Chris Rich and Randy all talk about the importance of building trusting relationships—crucial when dealing with a subject as sensitive and as personal as money. Christin a new certified financial planner who worked for many years as Rich’s assistant has sat in on hundreds of client meetings. She says there’s no particular technique or sales strategy involved in building trust. “Rich is just really very genuine and very much himself. He cares about the client first and foremost.”  Christin Rose This kind of care flows from a question that both Rich and Randy ask all their clients: “What do you want?” “The most important part of my job is spending time understanding the client” Rich says. “Money is just a means to something. What do you want to do with your money? Do you want to educate your children? Retire? Give money to charity? One question I ask almost everybody is ‘If you won $10 million in the lottery what would you do?’ The answers tell me a lot about how the client thinks about money.” Randy puts it like this: “You have to help people get what they want. ‘What do you want?’ ‘Where are you at?’ ‘How can we close the gap?’ It’s that simple. That’s the story that gets played out over and over again.” It may be a simple tune but humming it repeatedly seems to work. Over the years Healy Group has helped many hundreds of clients and accomplished more besides providing for the families of the employees and owners. The company has allowed Chris Rich Matt and Tim the freedom to serve as branch coordinators taking phone calls during the workday if need be. It has created jobs for community members and locals in an environment marked by fun friendship and service. There are birthday honorings a chili cook-off an annual trip to a South Bend Cubs baseball game talks on right speech service projects and plenty of prayer. “It’s a very positive environment” says Linda. “People care. The leaders have a vision. Being in a Christian environment your hope is not in your job it’s in the Lord. I think that helps keep things in perspective.”  Tim Pingel and Randy Raciti chatted at the most recent Fun & Fellowship Friday event. Regarding perspective Randy recalls a conversation with Rich that began as a discussion of standard business metrics: revenue profit and the growth of the company. Then Rich abruptly changed the topic. “I think we should just focus on what the Lord wants us to do with the relationships we have and just continue to respond to the Holy Spirit and keep taking steps” Rich said. The owners do not want to grow just for growth’s sake as Chris explains but in a way that is organic and in keeping with God’s desires for the company. Prayer is key. “We pray that the Lord sends us good people to work for us and helps us pick up good clients.” “The story of Abraham serves as a good guide for us” Randy says for Abraham proved “faithful in small things” and became the father of many.

5831,May 5 2017 10:39 a.m.,Alumna to Lead Trinity School at River Ridge,Beth Schmitz (Servant Branch) a mathematics and Scripture teacher gifted speaker and leader among the faculty will be the next head of school at Trinity School at River Ridge. Beth who graduated from River Ridge in 2001 is the first Trinity School graduate to serve as the head of a Trinity School. She follows Jon Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) who will assume the role of president of Trinity Schools Inc. in the summer of 2017. Jon takes the helm from Kerry Koller (South Bend) who is stepping down as president after 36 years and will continue to serve Trinity Schools Inc. in an advisory role. Beth who can still remember getting directions to morning prayer from a senior on her first day of school in 1995 says she is humbled honored and grateful for the chance to lead her alma mater. “I look forward to continuing our work of offering students a truly excellent education one that allows them to develop their natural abilities but also helps them to identify other gifts they would not necessarily identify on their own so they can serve the Lord in whatever ways he calls them to serve” she said. Beth grew up in Prescott Wisconsin in Servant Branch’s East Area the daughter of Tony and Claudia Schmitz (Servant Branch). After graduating from River Ridge she attended the University of Minnesota at Morris where she majored in mathematics with minors in both music and statistics. She credits her time at Trinity with broadening her interests and helping her to discover a love for mathematics which she continues to nurture by reading mathematical books on her summer breaks. During her senior year in college a friend suggested she might make a good Trinity School teacher. Beth applied and was hired right out of college never looking back. This is her twelfth year on the faculty at River Ridge. Beth made the covenant of the People of Praise in 2009 and serves her branch as a handmaid. At Trinity she has taught Latin Scripture Catholic doctrine science MATLAB computer programming and every math course in the curriculum. “I love sitting down at a seminar table with students from different traditions and digging into the Scriptures together something we are only able to do because Trinity is an ecumenical school” Beth said. She has served as master teacher for the tenth grade Scripture course and for several mathematics courses. She developed the mathematics course for River Ridge’s new sixth grade and has trained math teachers at The Wilberforce School a Trinity member school in Princeton New Jersey. David O’Hanley (Servant Branch) a fellow science teacher says Beth has an unusual ability to tailor her mathematics lessons to the needs of individual students. “She has a reputation as someone who listens to and understands students” he said. Penny Arndt (Servant Branch) who has taught at River Ridge since 1987 called her “very collegial—an excellent teacher and an excellent mentor for other teachers.” “She is a clear and confident public speaker with a lot of gravitas” Kerry said. “She is a leader not only among the faculty at River Ridge but among the faculty of all our campuses and member schools. I am delighted that she has agreed to serve us in this new way.” “Beth has distinguished herself for her calm serious-minded and unwavering commitment to our mission” Jon Balsbaugh said. “She brings to the office of head of school her long experience as a teacher and a considerable breadth of perspective that goes back to her days as a Trinity student. She cares for her students individually and puts forth all her effort to help them make their learning their own.” Beth is the fifth head of school at River Ridge.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5831

5740,March 24 2017 1:03 p.m.,Growing Old Together in Community,The family room in Servant Branch's center at River Ridge provides a congenial site for get-togethers such as the senior luncheon. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Bob Cunningham Photoresource I’m sitting in the living room of Jack and Florence Wright (Servant Branch) in a sunny open-plan apartment in Bloomington part of a senior living cooperative. Florence is telling me about the moment in 1977 when she and Jack put their home in Kennewick WA up for sale. Jack was one of the leaders in the People of Faith prayer group and several of the members felt called to move to a city with a covenant community. They had seven children and no certain plan for a job for Jack but they made the decision that their destination would be the Twin Cities where they would join the Servants of the Lord community (later Servant Branch) and their house sold within a week. Seven years after that move Jack then 45 suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident. When he regained consciousness he called Florence by her maiden name and was surprised to learn that they had children. Florence remembers Jack’s long process of relearning not justnames but how to walk. Despite all this the Wrights lived relatively independently until the fall of 2015 when Jack’s memory began to worsen. “If he’d start something he couldn’t finish it because he couldn’t remember what he was doing” Florence told me. It was time to move. Things went smoothly during the first winter in the apartment but when spring came Jack started feeling the urge to get outside. As Florence was getting ready to go to an exercise class Jack announced “I’m going for a walk.” Florence tried to convince him not to go but Jack insisted. He went for a walk and was waiting for Florence in the apartment when she returned from class. The next week when it was time for Florence’s exercise class Jack wanted to go for a walk again. Florence called Ralph Laven who lives one floor up with his wife Alice and has been Jack’s head for many years. After Florence returned from class she and Ralph watched out windows on opposite sides of the building anxious for Jack’s return. “We saw him after a while and he obviously didn’t know where he was going” says Florence.* * *Of the 473 covenanted and underway members of Servant Branch a quarter are over age 70 and three-quarters are older than 50. In light of this in 2014 Joel Kibler (then our principal branch coordinator) asked Mick Coleman to head a committee on aging. The committee made up of Mick Meg Ferber Nancy Caneff Beth Fondell Pat Flynn and Marty Willard has three goals: to provide a clear picture of the needs of aging members over the next 25 years; to write an assessment of resources in the branch and in the Twin Cities; and to assist the coordinators in plans for caring for the elderly. In the spring of 2015 their work involved gathering information collecting suggestions and running a series of forums for branch members about aging. Over the last year the team has continued their research with Mick reporting back to principal branch coordinator Tom Caneff every two or three months. “What Mick and Meg and others are doing is nothing short of inspirational” Tom says. “They talk things over pray discuss make a plan act on it and see what happens. If adjustments need to be made they can make those happen too.” One idea the committee has implemented came out of a seminar for caregivers that Meg Ferber and Pat Flynn attended at a local church. Mick says “We talked about what they did and thought we could take some of those principles and do it ourselves.” In January of 2016 Mick Pat and Meg started a monthly support group for caregivers and the group is still meeting. Six or seven couples are involved—sometimes both spouses come and sometimes only the caregiver. Says Mick “We’re putting them in a situation where they’ve got other people in the same situation and they’re able to talk to one another.”* * *Wanting more help with Jack Florence told the caregivers’ group about her exercise class and Jack’s desire to walk. The exercise was important to her — it greatly reduced pain in both of her legs from pinched nerves. Working with Florence to determine what would help her Mick organized a schedule of branch members to sit with Jack for an hour three times a week.  Jack and Florence Wright (Servant Branch) have both benefited from the love and service of their brothers and sisters in Christ in the aftermath of Jack’s traumatic brain injury. “Jack just loves to gab” says Florence “and he loves to have People of Praise members come over. He’ll ask ‘Who’s coming today?’ They’re his friends see.” Sometimes the visitors just sit and talk with Jack in the apartment and other times they take him out for a drive or along on an errand. “Jim Cahill took him to a new grocery store where he buys his vegetables” Florence says. “They have good bargains. One day Jack brought home a big turkey leg to eat.” Mick recently drove Jack to St. Paul to see the ice castles on display for the city’s yearly Winter Carnival. Florence notes “They’re helping me out as much as they’re helping Jack out.”* * *Two-thirds of Servant Branch members over age 70 are women. In 2009 Meg Ferber was appointed a handmaid designated to look out for the needs of seniors and she’s spent lots of time talking one-on-one with older women. “My main action now is with people who for various reasons are unable to participate in our life as they used to. Maybe they don’t come to women’s group or can’t make it to as many meetings. My efforts are to keep them connected with our life.” One method Meg has found helpful over the years is to arrange a schedule of visits for a sister in a nursing home or senior living facility so that one or two women will visit every week. The women making the visits might come only once a month on a rotating schedule so the time commitment is doable. Meg recommends keeping the visits short around 45 minutes. One or two visitors is a good number because they can concentrate the conversation on the sister being visited who might have difficulty with hearing or memory. Meg says “It’s good to have people who have known them because they have some history and they can bring things up. It’s good to share about your own life ask them about their life and pray with them. The elements of a women’s group can be there just in a more limited amount of time.”  Mick Coleman (left) Meg Ferber and Pat Flynn form part of the backbone of care for the elderly in Servant Branch. As the branch has put thought into how to care for seniors a myriad of other little ways to help each other have sprung up. There’s a small group of women created by Connie Schrandt and led by Ruth Jorgenson who get together regularly to spend a morning making soup and freezing it in single servings. These are stored at River Ridge where any senior who would find a meal helpful can take one home. There’s also a closet on the second floor of the building filled with donated medical equipment that’s available for anyone who needs it: wheelchairs walkers bath chairs and even a power chair. A live videostream of Servant Branch meetings on the Internet has made it possible for some branch members who can’t be there to participate a bit more fully. Sometimes the seniors themselves are the ones finding ways to serve. Ralph and Alice Laven are Jack and Florence Wright’s regular ride to branch meetings. When Dawn Whittenburg’s mother moved from South Dakota to the Ebenezer Ridges facility in Burnsville to be near her daughter Barb Van Natta signed up on the schedule of women visiting her. Barb lives at Ebenezer too and she takes her walker and sometimes pictures of her grandchildren down the long hallways to another wing to see Dawn’s mom.  Patricia Ficker surveys the delicious meal made by Carolin Faytle. The branch’s senior luncheon has become a hub for seniors to relate to one another and share ideas. Harold Coulter the branch’s business manager organizes eight lunches a year. After a short prayer everyone shares a meal homemade for every event by Carolin Faytle. (February’s luncheon featured baked stuffed shells french bread salad and Amaretto cake.) Then there’s a speaker on a topic of general interest. There’s enough space in the family room at River Ridge for about 40 people to attend each luncheon and there’s often a waiting list. Presenters have included Peggy Dietzen sharing her knowledge as a docent at the Minneapolis Institute of Art David O’Hanley a Trinity science teacher speaking on fracking and climate change and Bruce Olson owner of Truestone Coffee Roasters giving a demonstration of coffee cupping which is a little bit like wine tasting for coffee. At the December luncheon Louis Grams usually plays piano during lunch and leads carol singing afterward. At one senior luncheon Claire Pintozzi had an idea—“We ought to have a little thing just for us in the newsletter things that just concern seniors.” With some computer help from Connie Schrandt Claire’s “Senior Notes” now gets emailed out along with the branch newsletter. Claire includes updates on branch activities for seniors and gathers ideas about free activities and discounts available in the Twin Cities. She also passes along tips for dealing with such topics as doctors and insurance starting a garden in the spring and buying a plot in the People of Praise section of Resurrection Cemetery. “So many of us were young when we formed a new covenant community in the '70s” Meg says “and now many of us are growing old. We won’t grow old in the same way that much of society will. We will see one another through to the very end of our lives. We will support one another with a lot of care and affection and love.”* * *Near the end of my conversation with Florence Jack walks into the living room. Florence introduces me and asks him “So Jack tell her about the People of Praise. Do you remember them?” Florence says Jack isn’t always able to answer this sort of question but on this day at this particular moment his face lights up with joy. “Oh! I love People of Praise! I love serving God. I love following him. And they make it so possible for you to love God and know him and serve him to be with him and to be what he wants you to be.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5740
5737,March 24 2017 1:02 p.m.,My Hope for This Neighborhood,Netesha Mosley by Netesha Mosley Photos: Mary Timler Editor’s note: Netesha Mosley and her husband Savoria met the People of Praise missionaries in 2010 and have been involved in our mission work in Evansville ever since. In 2011 the Mosleys and their children moved to the South Side neighborhood where Netesha grew up. A prophetic word Savoria gave and Netesha’s encouragement were both significant factors in the missionaries’ decision to move to the South Side in 2012 focusing their work there. In this article Netesha shares her life story and some of her thoughts on what God is doing in Evansville. My hope for this neighborhood is for it to get back to the way it was when I grew up here. We used to do all kinds of things— making mud pies and climbing trees and playing dolls and sports. Parents watched out for each other’s children. If we acted up on Jefferson Street by the time we got home my parents knew that we had acted up. We would have Vacation Bible School in the summertime and the churches had choirs. We went to church every Sunday. As I got older we stopped doing that. My home life got horrible. There was a church right down the street and if it got bad at home I would go there and sit. It was a place of peace. After I was 17 or 18 I started drinking and smoking. I would be at my friend’s house and we’d do all that stuff and then I’d come home and think I don’t want to live like this. It seemed like everybody else was happy but me. I felt so alone. I met Savoria at my friend’s house. He was reading the Bible one time and I asked him “How do you read the Word?” Because I had tried but of course I had started with Genesis. He said “I ask God to show me what I should read and bless me with understanding.” That was a stepping stone for me. At that point I cut off everybody and I just started reading my Bible. I would go to school go to work come home and read. One day I was walking down the street and the Lord said turn here. So I turned and I saw a church sign and it was so bright. I checked out what time the service was and I went. After that I was gung-ho. When the Lord saved me my whole world changed. Savoria and I got married in 2001. We had decided we were going to try and have kids. We tried but we were having trouble conceiving. The doctor said “We’re going to have you go through surgery.” I was young and newly married. All of this was freaking me out. Then the doctor told me “You can’t have kids.” So I got home and I was just bawling. I stood at my back door and I was like God I don’t know what’s wrong but you can heal it. And it was almost like I could feel it. After that I was pregnant.  Savoria and Netesha and their children have been supporters of the missionaries in Evansville from the start. At that point I still considered myself a baby in Christ. I had seen some people around me who went to church but then they were still doing other stuff. I felt abnormal. I didn’t want to go out to the club I wanted to stay home with my kids and do what God wanted me to do. Also some people at church would talk bad about other Christian denominations. I’m like We all love the Lord. We should be praying for each other. So we went from church to church. In 2010 when we lived on Kerth Street I came outside. It was a pretty day but I was like Man I don’t have anybody to talk to. I felt like I was in that same position as before—alone. I said “Lord I want to live for you but I also want to have relationships. I want to be around people that want to live for you.” I was looking at the block and thought What would it be like to live with a whole block of people who serve the Lord? My vision was a block of nice houses with white picket fences. People would take care of homes and of each other. When you came onto the block you would feel the presence of the Lord. It was almost like the block was illuminated  that’s how beautiful it was. And I said “Lord I want that.” A few months later we met the People of Praise. The first thing I noticed was that the missionaries were from different denominations but were living in unity. I would do my studies in the Word and God would give me something and then when they’d come they’d share a word from the Lord and it would be the same! Wow. Knowing the missionaries has helped me grow. First I learned about the vision of community then about being a wife and mother in the Lord. Sharing about moments when we felt close to Christ in women’s group has helped us be more open about the Lord within our family. The People of Praise helped me to recognize when God is speaking. Women’s group has helped me to look at things differently and not just think Oh here comes another trial but Yes! We gonna make it through this! It has helped me to have real relationships actually being there for each other to help each other when it seems like the enemy’s attacking. The woman touching the hem of Jesus’ garment that’s how women’s group is for me.  Netesha and her women’s group canned applesauce together last fall. From left: Ellen Reed Netesha Cindy Sullivan Abby Earhart and Jewel a friendly local canning expert. In 2011 Savoria told me we were gonna move to Jefferson on the South Side. “Really?” I said. A lot of the people we grew up with they’d moved so it wasn’t the same. The crime was worse. And it was scary because it could be 10:00 at night and we’d hear gunshots and I’m like Kids get on the floor! I would have to catch the bus home and my son would see all these people standing out there and smoking on the corner. It was so sad I felt bad for them. And I’m like Lord what is going on? I didn’t want to live here. Then when the missionaries said “We’re looking to come to the South Side” I’m like Thank you Jesus! This is what you want for this neighborhood. You want peace. And a lot of people want it but they don’t know how to obtain it. When the missionaries came here it was just like this is how you do it. It was like a blueprint on how to live for the Lord. A lot of the kids here they need to know what love is actual love. It seems like the peer pressure to do bad is so overwhelming for them. My son is 12 and he goes to Washington Middle School. He says “Mom they’re calling me whack” because a lot of his peers are smoking marijuana. “Son you’re not whack” I tell him. “Marijuana is an addiction that clouds your mind. That’s how the enemy works. He wants you to fail.” And I tell him to forgive when they hurt him. I say “Son you don’t know what they are going through. But pray for them because you might be the only person praying for them.”  Netesha and her daughter show off the shower gift she received from the missionary women upon the birth of her son. Kids absorb everything around them. If you sow hatred then that’s what they’re going to give out. But if you start showing them love it might happen years later but that seed is sown. That’s what I teach my kids. I really believe that the core of what the Lord is doing in this neighborhood is dealing with children spending time with them and letting them be children. I’ve heard of kids quoting the Bible to their parents and how it touches their mom or their dad. I’ve seen the neighborhood change drastically. I mainly look at kids. You can see them change. At the ice cream parties I saw the kids having so much fun–hula-hooping jumping rope. It was just so beautiful. It’s like the Lord breathed some life into the neighborhood. It’s alive again.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5737
5751,March 24 2017 1:02 p.m.,In Communist Poland A Holy Spirit Wildfire,Jacek Reka (left) and Joel Kibler in Poland in the mid-1980s. by Joel Kibler Photos: Vine & Branches Archives From 1983 to 1986 I made five trips to Poland on behalf of the People of Praise. My trips were part of a broader outreach effort behind the Iron Curtain begun in 1977 by Andrew Plodowski one of the founding members of the community. Through the efforts of Andrew and his wife Beryl baptism in the Holy Spirit had spread like wildfire in Poland earning Andrew the nickname “the apostle of the charismatic renewal.” As winds of the Spirit blew interest in Christian community also grew and I had been talking with Polish leaders about joining the People of Praise. During this period Poland was a communist police state. In March of 1986 I flew from Chicago to Zurich then on Lot the Polish airline to Warsaw. When I got off the plane I was greeted at the bottom stair by the cold stares of 20-year-old soldiers holding AK-47s. At the entry to the terminal four more soldiers stared at me. Inside the terminal there were four more staring soldiers holding their AK-47s. At immigration the officer studied me intently for several seconds then with a grimace stamped my American passport. At customs the officer made a woman in line remove everything from her suitcases. Everything! He searched her eyeglasses case lipstick container mint breath box and tiny change purse. I started to get nervous. I had $10000 in $50 bills spread throughout my body briefcase and suitcase. They were a gift for the community of my host Jacek Reka a leader whom Andrew had prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. With the money Jacek and his friends could smuggle printing equipment into Poland and print Christian literature for distribution in Poland and the Ukraine. I started praying for the Lord’s protection. When my turn came the officer stared at me for a moment and said in accented English “Do you have any leather goods?” I said “None except my belt.” Without looking at me again he stamped my customs card waved me on and said “Next!” Outside I met Jacek. He put his finger toward his lips to signal not to talk and motioned me to his car. Finally 10 minutes from the terminal out on the highway he said “Did my Uncle Piotr send the gift?” “Uncle Piotr” was a code name we used in our correspondence for his anonymous benefactor. In my letter to Jacek via the notoriously unsafe Polish mail system I told him that an Uncle Piotr asked me to bring him a small wedding anniversary gift. Uncle Piotr was a Dutch businessman who believed Jesus wanted him to give all his money to the poor and needy all of it all $200 million. He wanted to die poor like Jesus. Jacek drove me to Krakow to his apartment building in an area called New Krakow one of a cluster of 20 buildings — all drab gray concrete personality-deprived architecture imposing and plain. We walked up six floors to his apartment — no elevator. He had wanted a sixth-floor apartment because it meant more stairs for the police to climb if they decided to pay a visit more time to hide documents in the hidden drawer of his kitchen table previously owned by a local Solidarity union leader. (Solidarity was the Polish labor union which eventually helped bring down the communist government.) I greeted his wife Maria and learned she had been arrested three years earlier by the secret police on a vague allegation of possessing illegal printed materials. The police had hauled her and her roommate to the station stripped them naked and taunted them saying “So where’s your Jesus to help you now?” Fortunately the police after searching her whole house had failed to notice the boxes of Bibles stacked on the floor next to a gas stove which Maria had hastily covered with a cloth. With no evidence they released the two women who went home praising God for their deliverance. I had seen the secret police before at a mass for the Solidarity movement that I had attended with Andrew. At the mass our host had pointed to the men in ties and trench coats telling us about the hidden tape recorders revolvers and cameras that such men carried. The secret police were like the FBI CIA and the police all rolled into one single oppressive internal military force.  In those years youth movements such as New Life were active despite government opposition. On my trips to Krakow Jacek would take me to the college student meetings at the Dominikanski a Catholic church run by Dominican priests and brothers. I remember entering the back door of the church descending a flight of stairs turning a corner and opening a door. Suddenly I found myself in a crowded auditorium with 400 Polish college students singing at the top of their lungs “Jezus jest Panem! Alleluia!” (Jesus is Lord!). I spent many days with these 400 students who met for combined weekly meetings larger prayer meetings and in cell groups of four to seven people. On weekends they drove to the nearby Carpathian Mountains on the Polish-Czechoslovakian border to participate in or to give Jesus Retreats to fellow students. One young man confided to me “This movement is my life. This is all I want. If I didn’t have Christ and these friends I would be hopeless.” These young men and women were so excited about being part of this movement that they worked every angle to get jobs in Krakow. Some of them stayed after graduation if possible and married one another. Their life together had become home for them. They wanted to talk about Jesus. They didn’t seem bothered by government spying restrictions on their freedom and the prospect of long workweeks to eke out a living the scarcity of paper tea and coffee and shoes. They simply wanted to be together. Their lives had changed for the better. They were full of joy and hope. One young man named Janusz told me he wasn’t an atheist anymore Jesus had revealed himself to him and he was so happy! Mariusz my 24-year-old interpreter lived simply like most students and gave his extra money for the purchase of food for weekend retreats. Ursula Piotr and their mother had a new set of good friends to comfort them while their father was in Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya for two years working in the oil fields. Andrew Plodowski had successfully prayed for a healing of Michal’s back injury and he was sleeping well for the first time in five years. Jacek and a few others were smuggling Bibles into the Ukraine. It was dangerous work. They called their group Nowe Zycie New Life. One night walking around again in this crowd of 400 I thought to myself What a great name! These people really are experiencing new life. In the midst of communist Poland they were a new Poland growing up like a tiny plant. I prayed “Father protect your plant and make it grow! And don’t let the government kill it.”* * *Want to learn more about the work of the People of Praise in Poland?

5749,March 24 2017 1:02 p.m.,Decked out on the Patio,A common sight in Tampa—a party at the shared patio of Ed and Josette Konczeski and Fred and Sue Smith. by Chris Meehan Photos: Susan Weilbacher Kevin Weilbacher Fred Smith Two couples in the Tampa branch Fred and Sue Smith and Ed and Josette Konczeski have created an attractive space for common life between their homes. The curved and meandering 40-foot-long patio is shaded by bending palm trees surrounded by flowering bromeliads and just a few feet from the waters of Old Tampa Bay. It has become a go-to spot for branch activities and outreach to the neighborhood with Lord’s Day meals birthday parties men’s and women’s gatherings an Easter brunch and even a root beer float party. The two homes are located in a prominent place within Regency Cove a retirement community of narrow streets and tightly spaced manufactured houses on the Interbay Peninsula in south Tampa. “People must pass by to get to the observation point overlooking the bay” says branch leader Tom Brophy “and neighbors frequently see us getting together. They hear our music and singing and the fact that the patio is shared is a conversation starter.”  Ed and Josette hosted a get-together in their home on the occasion of a visit from John Boughton (South Bend) last fall. Branch activities have started shifting to Regency Cove from Fountain Boulevard in Tampa a street which has been home to several branch families. The Smiths’ house is large enough to accommodate the entire branch and the branch has been meeting there every other month. That shift will accelerate when Tom and his wife Jackie occupy a new home just down the street from the Konczeski and Smith homes sometime this spring. In addition Geoff and Sue Kelleher and Jeannie Hopper (all South Bend) rent a home together in the neighborhood during the winter months and join the Konczeskis and Smiths for dinner once each week. The story of how these couples landed in Regency Cove begins in 2013. That year Fred and Sue then living 15 miles away from Tampa in Riverview FL decided to move closer to the city. They asked Ed to help. He pointed them to Regency Cove a 75-year-old development with low taxes and shared ownership of all the property. The Smiths found an empty lot they liked right on the water but it was too expensive. They were close to buying a different property but the owner of the first lot contacted them with an offer that was quite a bit lower than the initial price. The Smiths accepted the offer and began designing their home.  Bill and Peggy Blauvelt (South Bend) enjoy time with Sue Smith (Tampa). Meanwhile Ed and Josette had begun to consider leaving their home on Fountain Boulevard where the taxes were rising fast as developers bought old houses tore them down and erected larger more expensive homes. Sue learned that the house next door to the Smiths’ lot was going onto the market. She called the Konczeskis and said in a half-joking way “How badly do you want to be our neighbors?” A few days later Sue Josette and Bonnie Folvarcik were out shopping and Sue invited them to stop by and see their lot. Josette looking at the house next door had the feeling that she and Ed needed to act quickly if they were going to buy it so she made a quick call to Ed. She couldn’t write a check that minute so Sue and Bonnie got their checkbooks out and covered the $2000 in earnest money. Josette placed the money in the owner’s hands. “Not five minutes later the owner’s phone rang” Josette recalls. “It was another interested buyer.”  The patio was the ideal place to celebrate Fred Smith’s 80th birthday in 2014. Fred is in the foreground. In September of 2013 the Konczeskis moved in and the Smiths moved in two months later once construction on their home was complete. Fred and Sue’s home is positioned on the lot to create the maximum amount of space for the patio which is two-thirds on their property and one-third on the Konczeskis’—although Sue is quick to say that they don’t think of it that way. Fred adds “The layout pavers lights and plantings all have Ed’s touch.” The patio can seat 26 people for a dinner and can hold more for a party. Besides creating the patio the Smiths and Konczeskis have come up with a variety of ways of meeting and interacting with their neighbors in Regency Cove. Ed’s home renovation business now consists primarily of work for other residents of Regency Cove. Sue has started a quilting group which meets at the Regency Cove clubhouse and the Smiths take communion to homebound Catholic residents of the neighborhood often praying with them during their visits. They attend a neighborhood Bible study and drive sick neighbors to doctor visits. “We have lots of opportunities to be Christ to people” Sue says. “We just get up in the morning and ask the Lord what he wants us to do.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5749
5753,March 24 2017 1:02 p.m.,Girls' Group on the South Side of Indy,"The older girls' group gathers to share about their week while waiting for their pre-Bible story snack. Ellen Putzier (right seated). by Elizabeth Grams and Sean Connolly with reporting by Anne Osterhouse Photos: Cathy Walters South Side girls come from all kinds of families and have all kinds of troubles. There’s Isidora the nine-year-old Mexican whose mother speaks the tiniest bit of English and whose father isn’t in the picture - probably he’s back in Mexico. There’s Charity a teenager whose older brother has landed in jail and who has already run away from home once. There’s Virginia the girl whose mother broke down in tears as she told one of our missionaries that the family would be evicted. The girls have relatives in jail or an unmarried 18-year-old sister who just had a baby or an older sibling dabbling in Wicca. A few have no bed to call their own just a sofa or a mattress shared with siblings. Some are shuffled from house to house and relative to relative. They have questions: What do I say if my brother is mean to me? If another girl hits me at school what should I do? If God can do anything why do people sin? Why do people die? On Monday and Tuesday afternoons about two dozen of these Indianapolis South Side girls ranging in age from five to twelve come over to community houses and spaces for girls’ group. They come to be together to see friends and their older sisters in the Lord—members of the Christians in Mission team the Indianapolis campus division and the Indianapolis branch. They come to learn about God and find answers to their questions.  Two girls color together at the beginning of their girls' group. Jeff Brummer drives out in his old GMC van with one of the women to pick up the girls. The girls often run out of their houses eager to hop in. In warmer weather they sometimes walk to girls’ group singing at the top of their lungs the songs they learned at summer camp. Once they’ve arrived they play relay races and tag games in the green space that runs behind several of the CIM houses or work on crafts in Cornerstone Commons an apartment building a community member owns. They’ve learned to say the Lord’s Prayer to turn the other cheek to use simple table manners to honor one another and to say “I’m sorry.” Over a snack they listen to stories from the Bible and talk about what the gospel means for their lives. They pray together. These tiny spiritual seeds—the friendships planted here–are quietly growing and bearing fruit.  One of the girls asked the other members of her group to pray against her earache. In the fall Isidora and her mom came to the tent meeting hosted by the CIM team. There the mother spoke with Vivian Tragesser (Indianapolis) a fluent Spanish speaker and Vivian laid hands on her and prayed for her. Seeing her mom receive prayer Isidora and all her friends went up and asked for prayer too.  The younger girls' group usually end their time together by singing. One girl Britney came to talk with Ellen Putzier after her brother threw her prized MP3 player down a drain. It was a gift from their father who had just gotten out of prison and Britney was visibly angry. Britney and Ellen talked about what they’d been discussing in girls’ group the previous few weeks—forgiving enemies like Jesus did on the cross. Britney’s face eventually softened. Before she left she told Ellen “I want to forgive him.” Last year the Indianapolis branch covered costs to send one of the girls Taylor to Buffalo camp. When Ellen went to ask Taylor’s mom about it (Taylor’s parents were separated) the mom’s eyes welled up with tears. “Of course she can go” the mother said. She was so moved she could hardly speak as Ellen recalls. Taylor now asks the CIM women regularly if she can come to camp again this year. Hannah Roth (Indianapolis) recalls a moment when one girl kept lagging behind the others during their walk to girls’ group. Finally she confronted Hannah in dramatic fashion. “Miss Hannah just leave me. I’m too slow.” Hannah looked at her and laughed. “I’ll never leave you. If you need to walk slow that’s fine.” The next week the girl approached Hannah. “Miss Hannah you love me don’t you?"" “Yes of course. Why do you say that?” “Because you wouldn’t leave me last week.”  The younger girls' group enjoy running around in a game called Refrigerator in the green space on the block. Naomi Coney senses the high stakes for these girls when she looks at the ones who have entered their teenage years. She prays for Charity the girl who ran away (she’s home now) each time she walks past her house. She prays also for another teenage girl once as eager for God as the girls now coming to girls’ group whose Facebook page reveals the lure of illicit sex and worldly attention-seeking. “These kinds of things move me to want to do all we can to give these girls the tools now” she says—tools of Christian teaching and above all Christian friendship to anchor them when trials and temptations come. It’s what girls’ group is all about.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5753

5704,Feb. 20 2017 4:12 p.m.,Allendale Fifteenth Anniversary,by Sean Connolly Fifteen years ago on President’s day of 2002 Nick Holovaty J-T Kelly and I laid our eyes on Allendale for the first time. I am so grateful for all that God has done there over the past 15 years. For Stephen Parker who first brought us to the neighborhood and for Miss Beebe our first friend who called the police after someone broke into our house before we had even moved into it. For the first Action teams who came in the summer of 2002 enduring the heat and the early mornings and for Jeff Fournier and Steve Hendrickson who led our construction effort turning our mistakes into a home that still serves its use today. For Ricky Thomas and Pete Hammer who lived in our first missionary household. For the beauty of the neighborhood—the narrow roads the birds chirping in the pecan trees the rolling hills that make for a country atmosphere in the middle of a mid-sized city. I am grateful for the children those we knew then and those we know now and for their parents grandparents and other relatives who love them and envision a glorious future for them. Most of all I am grateful to God who called us as a community to go to Allendale and gave us a prophetic vision expressed in a poem that Nick and I wrote together based on Isaiah 65 that still rings true to me today:   I will rejoice in Allendale and be glad in my people; no more shall there be in her an infant that lives but a few days or an old man who does not fill out his days. For the child shall die a hundred years old and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed. You shall build houses and inhabit them; you shall build schools and learn in them; you shall build hospitals and be healed in them; you shall build businesses and spend your days in them; you shall pave roads and drive on them; you shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit; you shall not build and another inhabit; you shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a live oak tree shall the days of my people be and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. You shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity for abandonment or fear for welfare checks or sex; for you shall be the offspring of the blessed of the Lord and your children with you. You shall live together in a new Allendale and in a new Allendale you shall fill out your days.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5704
5697,Feb. 16 2017 4:51 p.m.,Jon Balsbaugh Appointed Next President of Trinity Schools,Mr. Jon Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) the head of school at Trinity River Ridge and a 20-year veteran member of the faculty will be the next president of Trinity Schools Inc. He follows Dr. Kerry Koller (South Bend) who has filled the role of president since the founding of Trinity School in 1981 and will step down this summer.  “I am confident that Jon’s vision leadership and experience will carry our mission at Trinity forward into the future” said Dr. Craig Lent chair of the Trinity Schools board of trustees which hired Jon after an extensive search. As president Jon will be responsible for overseeing Trinity’s three campuses—in South Bend IN Eagan MN  and Falls Church VA—as well as relationships with two member schools The Wilberforce School in Princeton NJ and Trinity Academy in Portland OR. His term of office lasts for six years and is renewable. Jon and his wife Jen also a teacher at River Ridge have five children: Dietrich (Servant Branch) 19 Anna (Servant Branch) 17 Emily 15 Nora 12 and Charis 8. The Balsbaughs will move to South Bend this summer so Jon can begin his new job. His replacement as head of school at River Ridge will be chosen this spring Kerry said. Jon grew up in Adair Village OR a small town outside of Corvallis. He credits his educational formation to his parents a machinist and a stay-at-home mother who made financial sacrifices to send him to a private Christian high school. He earned a B.A. in English from The Master’s College in Santa Clarita CA. After he and Jen were married the Balsbaughs moved to Minnesota where Jon earned an M.A. at the University of St. Thomas writing his thesis on C.S. Lewis’s novel Till We Have Faces. There searching for what God might be calling him to do with his life he stumbled upon a news article about Trinity School at River Ridge. “I was instantly captivated” he said. Jon started teaching at River Ridge in 1997 where he and Jen encountered the community. “We saw something in the mission of the school the integrity of the people involved and the quality of the families that led us to make an underway commitment” Jon said. The Balsbaughs made the covenant in 2006 and Jon became the head of school at River Ridge in 2009. He is a tenured coordinator. Kerry said he was delighted by the choice. “Jon is a man of tremendous intellectual depth who has masterfully developed the community of learners at River Ridge. He is one of our most gifted teachers in part because he is also a model learner. His love of truth goodness and beauty is revealed in his vast intellectual and aesthetic interests. He has the Trinity DNA.” Steve Hendrickson (Servant Branch) a longtime math and science teacher credits Jon with cultivating a vibrant culture of learning. “One of his notable decisions was to declare Free Learning Day” Steve said. “To the great surprise of our students we announced the cancellation of regular classes offering the students and faculty the chance to spend the day pursuing different interests—reading poetry together learning Italian cooking exploring the world of J.R.R. Tolkien or studying special topics in mathematics. We expected it to go well but the response from the students far exceeded our expectations.” Beth Schmitz (Servant Branch) a math teacher and River Ridge alumna points to Mr. Balsbaugh’s eloquence and clarity as a speaker explaining Trinity’s vision to students faculty and parents alike. Jon’s 2015 opening address to the students entitled “Ideas are Dangerous” gained a national audience after it was posted on the Internet and republished by the popular education blog Intellectual Takeout.   Joe Gleason (South Bend) an editor for the film director Terrence Malick who is living on assignment in Austin TX says his friendship with Jon began in the classroom discussing The Brothers Karamazov and has grown stronger over the years. “We have great conversations over email and have gotten together over breaks to discuss books movies art music Christ and our lives. Jon’s interests include cooking film and fly fishing. He is a gifted photographer whose images help me see beauty in ordinary things.” “For more than 35 years Trinity Schools have been faithful to the call of the Lord to provide students with an education rooted in the pursuit of truth the practice of goodness and the creation of beauty” Jon said. “Kerry has provided visionary and courageous leadership that has kept us grounded in our mission. It is at once a great honor and a humbling prospect to follow him into the office of president. I am looking forward to getting to know the faculty staff students and alumni of each of our campuses better and to working closely with our Trinity member schools. The foundation laid by the community during the founding of Trinity Schools Kerry’s steady leadership our dedicated and passionate faculty and most importantly a sense of calling from the Lord to engage in this work give me great confidence for the future of Trinity Schools.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5697
5652,Feb. 1 2017 12:30 p.m.,Pat Rath: Chief Morale Officer,Pat Rath by Chris Meehan Recent Photos: Collin Anderson Margaret Anderson; Other Photos: V&B Archives Pat Rath (South Bend) retired in December of 2016 after 42 years of work for two community enterprises Charismatic Renewal Services (CRS) and the LaSalle Company. A former banker and computer programmer who had worked in Boston and Los Angeles she began her work for the community in a small house with a shipping warehouse in the basement earning $2.74 per hour. When she retired she was the LaSalle Company’s vice-president and unofficial chief morale officer responsible for human resources and the company health plan. Along the way she answered hundreds of health insurance questions made sure everybody’s paychecks arrived on time and managed numerous state and federal filings. In the big picture she helped spread baptism in the Holy Spirit worldwide through charismatic conferences in Rome Kansas City and Dublin and laid the groundwork for a book distribution business that produced millions of dollars to support the mission of the People of Praise.  Sharon Sklorenko enjoyed reminiscing at Pat’s retirement party December 9. She began work in January of 1974 a few months after the community decided to take responsibility for the South Bend branch of CRS serving as an assistant to Clem Walters the general manager. CRS was then located in two small houses a few doors down from each other. “In those early days Pat was my right arm” Clem recalls. “We were a small crew and we had to figure out how to do things we hadn’t done before like running a major international conference in Rome. We were also shipping books and pamphlets about the charismatic renewal around the world. From the start Pat was game for whatever job needed to be done.”   As the charismatic renewal grew so did the conference office and book distribution center moving to the LaSalle Hotel in 1975. The number of full- and part-time employees grew to over 40. According to a 1982 issue of Resource the community’s newspaper the company shipped 115 tons of books in 1981 and by 1982 more than 200000 people had attended CRS-administered conferences. Pat took responsibility for payroll and administering the health insurance plan becoming personnel manager and assistant to CRS president Dick Keusch. During this period she also returned to school shoehorning in classes to become a CPA while working full-time.   In 1979 CRS began selling Bibles and textbooks to Catholic parishes and institutions. This new textbook business grew gradually with profits increasing even as conferences shrank and sales of charismatic renewal literature began to drop off. Bob McDonough who served as president from 1987 to 2010 recalled “Pat proved to be a jack of all trades. It seemed like she could do anything. She could take apart a computer. She was a CPA and helped people with their taxes and served as a notary public. I knew quite a bit about finance from my years as a banker but she taught me the book business. As the company’s main person concerned with the welfare of employees she could be tough but fair. She expected people to do their jobs and do them well. She played a big part in our success.” Her day-to-day responsibilities continued to evolve. She worked at the receptionist’s desk and in the company’s retail bookstore. As vice-president she kept things running smoothly during three time periods when the president or general manager was incapacitated for an extended period.    Pat and Alice Staffelbach. Tim Slowiak a long-time manager consulted with Pat on a number of personnel matters and recalls how she constantly exhorted him to err on the side of mercy and generosity. “Pat’s words to me embody the respect for others that permeated her relationships and the dignity with which she treated our employees. Her advice may be the best advice I’ve ever been given.” Denise Hurley who has worked in several different departments said “I remember Pat emphasizing to me that maintaining good relationships in the office was the most important thing to remember.” Pat often used humor to communicate her messages and loved to tell stories about her family members in Maine–in a perfect Maine accent. She wore a shiny green wig on St. Patrick’s Day and once dressed as R2-D2 from Star Wars for a company-wide costume party.    Pat enjoying St. Patrick’s Day with Larry Day. She had a knack for giving a human touch to the reams of paperwork she processed. Christine Ziegler who has taken on some of Pat’s responsibilities points to the bulletin board in Pat’s old office filled with photographs of babies. Over the years as employees contacted her in order to add their newborns to the health insurance plan Pat would ask them to send along a picture. “Pat is heroically generous” said Paul DeCelles. “She lived with us in household in the late 1960s and early 1970s eventually moving out so she could live in the rat-infested apartment of another single sister in the community. This sister was a recovering drug addict who lived in a dangerous neighborhood plagued by drugs and violence. Pat emptied her checking account to pay this sister’s bills as well as a debt she owed to a drug dealer who was threatening her. That is typical of Pat’s great generosity which she showed many other times during her years at the LaSalle Company.” My favorite memory of Pat occurred on a winter day in the early 1980s when she came back to the office late after swimming at the YMCA which was therapy for her bad back. She explained to me that her car battery had run down. A young brother in the community offered to jump the car. He succeeded even though he was not mechanically minded and shared with Pat his delight at his success. Pat felt his joy so deeply that she later told the Lord she would be willing to undergo similar difficulties in the future if they would encourage others.    LaSalle employees Larry (warehouse) and Valerie Day (order department) took a selfie with Pat at her retirement party. That attitude of wanting to help others was evident in Pat’s closing remarks at a luncheon held in her honor on December 9 at the LaSalle Company. After exhorting everyone to keep sharing God’s love with the company’s customers vendors and suppliers she reminded them that even though she was no longer an employee she still loved them all. “If there’s anything—large or small—that I can help you with please give me a call. Remember you have my cell phone number my e-mail and my heart.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5652
5658,Feb. 1 2017 12:30 p.m.,Servant Branch: Opening Doors in the Suburbs,From left: Pat and Lee Ann Murphy Mike Swanson and Bernadette Fossen went door-to-door in Burnsville. by Elizabeth Pease Photo: Bob Cunningham One Saturday morning in Burnsville Minnesota Bruce Olson (Servant Branch) walked up his neighbor’s driveway with fellow branch members Norma Cahill and Pat Murphy. A woman had her garage door open and was getting ready to leave. “Hi. We’re Christians and we live in this neighborhood. We’re asking people if they want to pray with us for this country” Bruce said. The woman paused then said “Okay sure” and the four of them held hands in the driveway and prayed. “Is there anything specific we can pray for you for?” Norma asked. “My husband has been having headaches” the woman replied. “We’ve taken him to doctors but we haven’t been able to get a diagnosis.” They prayed with the woman for God’s healing and grace then Bruce looked up and saw tears streaming down her face. As the group walked down the driveway she called out “You guys are doing a great thing.” Over the last two years a group of Servant Branch members led by Pat Murphy has met over dinner in one another’s homes to talk about outreach in their area. They all live in Burnsville a Twin Cities suburb that is home to over 30% of branch members. The composition of the group has fluctuated but it usually includes Pat and his wife Lee Ann Bruce and Charlene Olson Bernadette Fossen Mary Radtke and Jim and Norma Cahill. “We sensed the Lord wanted us to get together in Burnsville to see what ways there are for us to reach out to people” Pat said but whenever the group discussed knocking on neighbors’ doors many of them felt uncertain. They thought that door-knocking was for poor neighborhoods and wouldn’t work in the suburbs. Still urged on by good experiences when door-knocking on the West Side of St. Paul and while visiting the new starts they decided to set their fears aside. They started going out on Saturdays in groups of three or four. What they found surprised them. “People are pretty open” Bruce said. “Even those who didn’t want to pray with us would tell us their life stories.” In one cul-de-sac they met a woman working on her lawn mower. At first she seemed cold and didn’t want to pray as Bruce recalled but they continued talking with her and she began to tell them about her church. After they had talked for a while Bruce asked again about praying and she agreed. A few weeks later they knocked on her door and she welcomed them warmly. “Her demeanor had changed” Bruce said. “She prayed with us very openly” then she brought out a plate of cookies. One Saturday Jim’s group knocked on a door in a townhome complex and a Muslim woman in her forties an immigrant from Somalia wearing a long brightly colored dress and a headscarf came out. She said “We pray for the country every day.” Joe Frank who was with the group that morning asked if she would like to lead the prayer. She prayed “Allah bless our country. Allah bless our neighborhood. Allah bless our families.” Afterwards she told them “My biggest concern being here is living in fear.” Jim and Norma invited her over for a meal and a month later she and her cousin who was in her sixties came to the Cahills’ house for lunch and they brought the meal. Jim recalls “We had a wonderful time and were laughing just like neighbors like old friends.” One of the women said “This is the first time in 10 years that I feel like I can belong here.” Bernadette Fossen who lives in Burnsville with her husband Chuck met a Vietnamese man who had recently moved to the neighborhood. “I have friends who are Vietnamese” she said. “That was helpful as an icebreaker because I understand some of their culture and a teeny bit of the language. We made a connection and I’ve stopped over there three times and invited him to different events. To me it’s the beginning of a friendship.” Jim sees the door-knocking as a natural extension of the other outreach efforts they’ve been making in their neighborhood for the last few years. The Cahills have hosted root beer float parties on their lawn and wrap-around porch several times a summer announced by a chalkboard easel at the end of their driveway a few days beforehand. The last two years they’ve also hosted a three-day camp for kids at their home with help from Action students. When knocking on doors Jim says many of the neighbors recognize them from the parties. The group plans to continue door-knocking into the spring. Bruce explains it this way: “God shows up. Sometimes it seems like he’s in the circle in the conversation because people respond to us in a way that seems like they’re more responding to him than to us. He’s touching their hearts.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5658
5655,Feb. 1 2017 12:30 p.m.,Cleaning Out My Car: Reflections on the Covenant,Dave Porter (Indianapolis) his daughter Maria and her new (used) acquisition. by Dave Porter Photos: Maria Porter Nano Farabaugh A few weeks ago I went with my daughter Maria to check out a car she was interested in buying. We drove together to the dealership and looked at an SUV. It was a used vehicle but it looked spectacular. The paint sparkled. It had new tires and a new battery. There was no trash or clutter on the floor or seats no dents on the body. We were both drawn to it and I couldn’t help but notice how different it was from the car we had arrived in. Over the years it had become a little cluttered and a little dusty with a pair of sunglasses on the console some smudges on the dash from greasy fingers some hairpins on the floor some crumpled-up wads of paper strewn about. Little by little I had stopped treating my car like the shiny and attractive vehicle it had once been.This year as I was reflecting on our covenant I began to wonder if I have allowed my covenant life in the People of Praise to become a little bit like my car. There are some dusty areas some places where the carpet could be fixed up and others that could benefit from a little paint. My life may not be as attractive to others as I would like it to be. Now I’m not a theologian or a historian or a journalist. I’m an orthopedic surgeon who operates on feet and ankles but you might be surprised to know that a big part of my job involves interviewing patients collecting their histories trying to understand their pasts and their problems. As I was reflecting on our covenant I wanted to go back to the beginning to find out what this “car” was like when it was brand new so I decided to drive to South Bend and spend some time interviewing three of our founders Clem Walters Kevin Ranaghan and Paul DeCelles. It was a wonderful experience. I wish I could share everything that I learned but I want to highlight five themes that caught my attention. First the original 29 members made the covenant because they experienced a call from God. Kevin told me that for several years they had been hearing prophetic words about being a community. Tom Noe (South Bend) recorded one example in his journal in 1971: “I am building my kingdom among you . . . Once you were no people but now you are a people.” There were words about becoming one becoming a community of love becoming God’s house his building his people. There were words about taking care of one another and being committed to one another as Clem told me. The covenant wasn’t merely a human idea it had been on God’s mind and on his heart and the first group of brothers and sisters who made the covenant were responding to that divine desire. Second all three brothers mentioned a need they felt for stable relationships that would last longer than a few months or even a few years. Clem told me that he and Julie had been searching for these kinds of relationships first in their parish then in the Cursillo movement and eventually in the charismatic renewal. They experienced the Lord working in all three of these situations and yet each situation was very fluid. People would move in and out of them leaving for the slightest of reasons. In the renewal Clem noted “We had leaders’ groups we had prayer meetings we had national conferences that brought together thousands of people. We had all of that going and yet we still didn’t have the stickum the glue for our families and for us.” Clem saw the covenant as a way of establishing relationships that they and their children could really count on. “When it came time to make the covenant” Clem said “I knew in my heart that this was it.”  From left: Kevin Ranaghan Paul DeCelles and Clem Walters. Third the covenant provided a basis for establishing practical ways of living together. Paul told me “It was only through the covenant that we could really have youth ministry that we could put the bringing up of our children in common and put our finances in common that we could agree on what we were going to teach that we could have headship that works and could love and serve one another without getting burned out.” There’s a flip side to this which Kevin pointed out. If we don’t do the practical things that make up our life—talking to our heads coming to meetings celebrating the Lord’s Day together etc.—then our trust in one another will diminish and we will value our covenant less. Fourth they wanted to imitate the first Christian community not only in their close common life but also in the fact that they were a small community with a big mission—to bring the world to Christ. Paul said that he and others on campus at Notre Dame had been studying community and the first Christians since 1963. “We had a strong impulse for early church living but before the baptism in the Holy Spirit it was hard for people to be charged up enough to actually make community happen.” Filled with the Spirit and strengthened by a covenant commitment the brothers and sisters began taking on various works and ministries. Kevin pointed to a long list of apostolic activities that would not have been possible without the covenant: putting on charismatic conferences in Rome Kansas City and elsewhere spreading the baptism in the Spirit in Poland caring for the needy establishing Trinity Schools praying with people for more of the Lord and carrying out our mission work in the Mississippi River Valley. The covenant of those first 29 was a force-multiplier. Think of the many hundreds of thousands of people we have impacted for Christ because those 29 made a covenant! Lastly all three brothers said that the covenant established the relationships that allowed us to be a real family a people brothers and sisters. Paul mentioned something that really struck me. He said “Why don’t we promise to one another what we want?” A promise; that really hit me. What have I promised to the Lord and to my brothers and sisters? Kevin shared a moving story about experiencing this on the night he and the other original 29 brothers and sisters made the covenant on October 15 1971. “After I had made the covenant I looked up and the first person I saw across the room was Clem. I’m an only child so I’ve never had brothers and sisters but when I looked at Clem I realized in the depth of my being that Clem and I would be brothers for the rest of our lives that we had made this solemn and serious agreement to belong to one another to be family to be faithful to one another and to be committed to one another and the life the Lord had given us as a community. It was a very strong experience that has stayed with me ever since.” Kevin’s experience is one that so many of us have had over the years: we really are brothers and sisters because of the covenant. Paul said “Making the covenant is like that moment when you’re in love when you dare to take a risk and tell the other person ‘I love you.’ Making the covenant was stating positively very out front ‘I love you all. So let’s all promise that we will live our lives together in Christ that we’ll do things in common: accepting obedience in headship accepting a community of goods accepting a regular community meeting.” Paul’s words reminded me of the love I felt when I made the covenant myself in 1985 in Muncie. I want that love to shine through me each and every day and so I’m going to throw out all the trash that has accumulated in my car polish the dash and make the paint job sparkle again. I’m going to rededicate myself to personal prayer to my men’s group and to our branch meetings to having Lord’s Days and really making them zing to serving and caring for my brothers and sisters out of love for God for all of you and for the whole human race. Glory to God!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5655
5649,Feb. 1 2017 12:29 p.m.,Egged on by the Spirit,Dave Young in front of his Prius. by Dave Young Photo: Kiki Young Splat. An egg hit the window of my blue Prius and broke. The yolk ran down the glass. I was just a block from my home in the northern Virginia suburbs driving my family back from a Trinity play. Anger suddenly rose up within me. What if I had lost control? My family could have been hurt. I could have hit someone! I’m gonna get the perpetrator! I pulled over got out of the car and started searching. No one was on the street so I stalked into the backyard of one of the houses but it was empty. My wife Karen pointed to some egg on the ground near a driveway. I knocked on the door of the house. No answer. We drove home and I switched cars and went back parking nearby. Sure enough soon a high school-age boy came out of one of the houses and began wiping egg off the street. I got a good look at him went home and called the police. The officer who came out told me he couldn’t do anything since no one had witnessed the incident. I replied that I felt compelled to go back and talk to the boy’s parents. If one of my children had thrown an egg I’d want to know I reasoned. A few hours later my resolve about returning to the house had weakened. My peace had returned my car was clean and I was back to my life. I was ready to move on and really didn’t want to go up the street and confront anyone. But something inside of me—I’m convinced it was the Holy Spirit—urged me to return. I walked over to the house and noticed a car in the driveway and a man the boy’s father watering some plants. He looked at me warily. I explained what had happened. “Did he have blonde hair?” he asked. “Yes.” “That’s my son” he replied. He apologized courteously telling me that his son wasn’t home but that he would have him apologize to me and clean the car. I thought about ending the conversation and returning home but again the Spirit prompted me. “Is there some adversity going on in your son’s life?” I asked. Soon the dad was in tears telling me that his wife had left them that fall. As he shared his story I consoled him and prayed with him telling him that he was a hero for doing all he could for his children during such a hard time. Before I knew it more than an hour had passed so much time that my wife later told me she had been worried about me. The next day I went down the street again and met the boy but by that time my heart had done a 180-degree turn. I felt no need to give him a piece of my mind. I was an advocate and encourager instead of the adversary I had been the previous day. Over the next few months I stopped by the house to visit the father and son taking time to joke listen and encourage and pray with them. I became friends with the father and the son and I developed an easy rapport. Eventually the family moved from the neighborhood and we lost touch though the father and I remain friends on Facebook. This experience has reminded me that good can come from anything that the world or the devil throws our way . . . even an egg.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5649

Libby Grondin who teaches music said this about this photo of one of the preschoolers which was taken last Tuesday: He ""had the opportunity to explore the cello for the first time. He was able to pluck and bow (with help) the strings but in order to get a better feel for how it makes such a big low sound he put his hands (and then his ear) to the cello's top. He was very excited and surprised at how much the cello vibrated!""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5677
5628,Jan. 13 2017 2:32 p.m.,Kerry Koller to Step Down As President of Trinity Schools,From Craig Lent Overall Coordinator of the People of Praise and Chairman of the Board of Trustees Trinity Schools Inc.: Dear Brothers and Sisters After 36 years of service and visionary leadership Dr. Kerry Koller has decided to step down from his position as president of Trinity Schools Inc. His resignation will take effect in the summer of 2017. The Trinity Schools board of trustees has already begun the difficult task of choosing his replacement.  Kerry has filled the role of president since 1981 when we opened the doors of the first Trinity School in South Bend. Through his guiding vision we have grown from a small community of learners in a rented church hall to one that includes three campuses two member schools and more than 2000 alumni. Trinity’s reputation for academic excellence has expanded nationally and our model has provided the foundation for two member schools Trinity Academy in Portland and The Wilberforce School in Princeton New Jersey as well as more than a dozen public charter schools in Arizona Texas and Colorado including the Thomas Maclaren School in Colorado Springs. Our three campuses have earned a total of seven Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. Of Trinity at Greenlawn the late author and political thinker Russell Kirk said “I know of no better school in these United States.” I want to offer Kerry my most heartfelt thanks for his enormous contributions to Trinity and his decades of hard work on behalf of all of us. Kerry has met the daily challenges of leading and growing Trinity Schools with constant cheerfulness and a deep joy laboring faithfully out of love for our covenant and a desire to bring the blessings of a Trinity education to as many people as possible. Kerry has a great love of seminars and many of us have experienced his brilliant insights into books and his deep openness to the ideas of others stemming from his core belief that truth is more easily discovered in a community. Fortunately Kerry has agreed to stay on as Trinity’s president emeritus and he will advise the next president of Trinity Schools in the execution of his or her responsibilities. In the coming months I hope that many of us can have the chance to thank and honor Kerry. Kerry’s love of a good discussion goes back to his days as a high school student in San Francisco when he would listen in as his father’s friends a collection of philosophers and theologians debated the big issues of their day. He attended St. Mary’s College of California where he read the Great Books and learned to appreciate classical music while living in the home of Dr. Ronald McArthur who went on to found Thomas Aquinas College. Kerry and Barbara moved to South Bend in 1963 where Kerry attended the University of Notre Dame earning his Ph.D. in philosophy. At that time he met Paul DeCelles Kevin Ranaghan and Clem Walters who eventually became his friends and fellow leaders in the community and at Trinity. In 1969 the Kollers moved back to San Francisco where they and others founded the John the Baptist Charismatic Renewal Community eventually returning to South Bend and joining the People of Praise with many others who moved from San Francisco. I would be remiss if I did not also mention the long service Barbara has given to our mission at Trinity in her many years as a teacher and admissions director and in her willingness to move not once but twice along with Kerry as the Kollers helped lay the foundations for the River Ridge and Meadow View campuses. The Kollers have five children all Trinity School graduates: Katherine Brophy ‘85 (Colorado Springs) Stephen ‘87 (South Bend) Jack ‘92 Elizabeth Adams ‘95 (northern Virginia) and Peter ‘95. Tom Finke (South Bend) a founding faculty member whose relationship with Kerry goes back to the 1970s says Kerry’s biggest contributions to Trinity include “constantly holding up the Trinity vision” and developing the Humane Letters Seminar courses which remain close to Kerry’s heart. “These are things that make Trinity Trinity” he said. Bridget Donohue (South Bend) a longtime teacher and administrator said “I could tell tons of stories about Kerry but I think they would all reflect the fact that he simply has the Trinity School mission in his blood. For him it’s not a job. It’s a life.” Paul DeCelles (South Bend) added “Kerry has been a brilliant leader for Trinity Schools. Trinity’s educational model has been widely admired and copied numerous times. The ripple effects of his work go on and on.” Some of those ripples include the many wonderful missionaries that Trinity has produced making possible the community’s mission work in the Mississippi Valley. Kay Yohe (northern Virginia) head of school at Meadow View praised Kerry’s ability to freely follow a line of inquiry wherever it leads encouraging others to do the same. Jon Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) the head of school at River Ridge and John Lee (South Bend) head of school at Greenlawn both pointed to Kerry as the model of a lifelong learner with a wide range of interests. “As long as I have known him Kerry has continued to pursue a deeper understanding of the world searching for the truth—whether in science poetry fiction or philosophy” Jon said. Kerry says he is looking forward to serving Trinity School and the community by reading thinking and writing which he expects to have more time for in the coming years. “I am so thankful to the Lord for leading Barbara and me to the People of Praise. I was blessed to be guided by Paul Kevin and others as we considered what we were convinced was a leading from the Lord to try something new to educate our own children and the children of other families who would be attracted by our mission. I've had the opportunity to be the head of school at each of our schools to converse with and work alongside three marvelous faculties and to teach at each school myself along with Barbara. After all of this who knows what more the Lord has in mind?”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5628

Boughton Photos: Linda FinkeThe idea first came to Peggy Go when she read in the local Catholic newspaper about a retreat for young people of different ages and abilities that had taken place in another corner of the diocese.Why not have an event closer to South Bend? she wondered.When she called the diocesan Ministry for Persons with Disabilities she learned that their role is simply advisory. They don’t organize retreats themselves. Peggy figured that this let her off the hook but the Holy Spirit kept nudging her. She thought about Julie Walters’s book God Is Like and it occurred to her that it might provide the framework for a retreat. Then she enlisted not only Julie but also Pam Peterson Ruth Sanford and me. Some of us have experience parenting or teaching youth with different abilities. Some have written curricula for our churches and People of Praise youth ministry. As we began to brainstorm we discovered a delightful complementarity in our gifts concerns and expertise. Then we discovered an online commentator who calls herself “Jenny the Jewel.” She explains how performing acts of service taught her that God had a purpose for her life. They helped her no longer to question whether God had made a mistake when he created her with Down syndrome.

5580,Dec. 20 2016 3:05 p.m.,The Power of Special K Bars,by Sean Connolly Most evenings a group of men are sitting listening to music playing cards and drinking beer underneath a scrubby pine tree in a dirt front yard on Dove Street in Allendale. Missionary David Zimmel used to walk by often. Sometimes he’d be carrying a plate of food—his contribution to a common meal at the Bowars or the Reinhardts who live next door to where the men gather. “Where you goin’ so fast?” one of the men would call out if he saw the food. David would stop show him the salad or bread he was carrying offer the man some and then the man would refuse. This friendly verbal dance continued each time David went by with food with call response offer and refusal until one day last spring when David was carrying a pan of Special K bars. (They are normally made with Special K cereal peanut butter and corn syrup with melted chocolate and butterscotch but this time David had substituted bran flakes for the Special K.) The man said he’d like to try them so after dinner David brought him the leftover bars. A few months later David was walking by again when he heard a familiar voice. “Hey man when are you gonna bring me some more of those bars?” “When do you want them?” David asked. “Tomorrow?” the man suggested. David was reluctant explaining that he’d have to go to the store to get the ingredients and that the bars could be kind of expensive to make. “How much we talking?” “Five or ten bucks.” “That’s it? That’s nothing” the man said. Then he walked to his car brought out a crumpled $5 bill and gave it to David. Several days later David returned with a full pan of the bars. The man appeared to have forgotten about his request but his face lit up when he saw them. He and the other men ate them eagerly. That day the group included a neighbor from across the street Oscar. He’s a strong man a landscaper by trade with a huge voice and a history of being unfriendly to the mission team. Nathan Barrett recalls when Oscar cussed him out in that booming voice as he and some other team members were helping someone move out of a nearby house. “You’d wave at Oscar and he’d look the other way” recalled Gerry Deakin. When Oscar found out David had made the bars he couldn’t believe it. He told David he’d like to hire him to make some for a family reunion he would be hosting at his house. “What if I teach you to make them?” David asked. The next day David brought another set of the ingredients over to Oscar’s house. He had never been inside before in spite of many years of attempting to befriend Oscar including numerous offers to have Action volunteers work at his house. Oscar had always refused. David joined Oscar and his wife Vanessa in the kitchen and they made the bars—a simple job that took about 20 minutes. Oscar also showed David his new refrigerator and asked if he knew how to hook it up to the water line. The next weekend David and Joe Bulger spent the day connecting the refrigerator laughing with Oscar as they made trip after trip to the hardware store trying to find the proper pipe fitting. Oscar told David that the Special K bars had been a hit with his family and that everyone wanted them at their next gathering. David soon left town for two weeks but while he was gone Oscar walked across the street to where the Bowars and Reinhardts live. Both families have young babies less than a year old. Oscar saw Ben and Kathleen Reinhardt and stuffed a $10 bill in Ben’s hand telling them he wanted them to buy a toy for their son Luke. Then he told them he wanted to have them and the Bowars over to his house for a barbecue. Oscar also visited the Bowars giving them $10 for their twins and inviting them to the barbecue. John Bowar says he has observed this friendliness growing in Oscar. It appears to stem from little gestures: from the Special K bars from the caramel rolls the Bowars delivered at Easter time and from Oscar seeing John and the twins taking a walk. One day Oscar took out the Bowars’ trash. Another evening he offered to stand watch while Colleen Bowar brought in some groceries from the car wanting her to know she was safe. Nowadays Oscar doesn’t look away when a mission team member greets him but points out John to the other men when John is going by saying “Hey that’s my neighbor.” John for his part calls him “Uncle Oscar” wanting his kids even at their young age to see their neighbor as part of the family. “When I called him Uncle Oscar he just got this huge grin on his face” John said. Most recently Oscar gave the Bowars another gift for the twins $20 this time. “I’m gonna be their godfather” he told Colleen. “And I’m gonna be a really good godfather!” Special K Bars• Microwave 1 cup sugar and 1 cup corn syrup in 30-second intervals until sugar dissolves.• Mix in 1 cup peanut butter.• Mix in 6 cups Special K or other crispy cereal.• Press into greased 9x13 pan and put pan into fridge or freezer to chill.• Microwave 1 to 2 cups each of chocolate and butterscotch chips in 30-second intervals until melted.

5577,Dec. 20 2016 3:05 p.m.,Fire Man,Two squatter families share this isolated shack on the edge of a swamp in Portmore Jamaica. by Chris Meehan  Photo: Kevin Rodriguez“Deh house a-bun down!”Andre Johnstone (Kingston) was bringing a monthly supply of food to a shack occupied by two families of squatters when he spotted a small boy of about six and his smaller brother walking by the road. The smaller child had tears in his eyes. When Andre stopped the car the larger boy explained that their house was burning.Andre drove quickly to the shack a wide structure built from plywood scraps and faded wooden signs for a beauty salon. He recognized it as the house where he was supposed to be delivering the food.“I could see flames in the roof” he recalled. The roof was a mixture of corrugated zinc panels and cardboard with the pieces held in place by large rocks.“I got out of the car and my daughter said ‘Where are you going Daddy? Be careful!’”Inside the dark shack Andre found the place where the ceiling was burning and saw a piece of cardboard hanging down also in flames. An electrical wire dangled from the ceiling charred and blackened.He grabbed a bedsheet and began waving it but fanning only made the fire grow stronger so he pulled down the piece of cardboard and flung it outside. There one of the children told him to look for a water bottle on a table—the shack had no running water. Back inside Andre felt around for the bottle grabbed it and used it to extinguish the flames in a roof beam along with the embers that had fallen onto the floor.“There was just enough water to put out the fire” he said.With the fire quenched Andre took the children to their mother who was in a nearby bar. She said she had left them with an uncle but he was nowhere to be found.“I praise God that I got there at that time” he said. “The fire department would never have arrived in time and the whole structure could have burnt.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5577

Back row from left: John Brickweg Tony Kuplic Bob Brickweg Christine Brickweg David Gruber. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Tom Bowar Cathy SchwabSixteen Servant Branch members have taken up residence on the second and third floors of an old convent in the West Side neighborhood of St. Paul an ethnically and economically diverse area of the city where the branch also has an outreach. The group living in the convent includes two campus households (one for men the other for women) one family (Bob and Christine Brickweg and their son John) and a single woman Kati Ritchie. The convent is located on the grounds of St. Matthew Parish and had been vacant for several years since its previous tenants the Sisters of Notre Dame had moved out.Their motivations for making the move vary.For the campus households which had been living in Minneapolis near the University of Minnesota the new location in St. Paul offered several practical advantages. The West Side is more central to all the colleges and universities the students are attending—not only the University of Minnesota but also the University of St. Thomas Inver Hills Community College St. Paul College and Metropolitan State University. The new location cuts down on the commute time for some. The students also wanted to live in a neighborhood where other community members are living and five other community households live within walking distance of the convent. Lastly they were intrigued by the branch’s outreach on the West Side and some of them hoped that their presence in the neighborhood would allow them to participate in outreach activities in the future.Bob and Christine simply felt what Bob called “a stirring in our hearts” to move to the West Side and they’re keeping an open mind about what the Lord has for them in their new location. John 18 had dreamed of spending his senior year living with the men’s campus household so when his parents proposed the idea of living across the hall from them he was thrilled. Kati says she has had a heart for the West Side neighborhood for more than 30 years especially for its many Spanish-speaking residents.  490 Hall Avenue,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5571

The load included a freezer refrigerator dishwasher lumber fencing and rakes as well as numerous items for the Evansville urban farm (recently named “Praise Harvest”). Nick and fellow missionary Andrew Pingel drove the truck back to Evansville on November 6.The effort to fill the truck was the brainchild of Bill Sjoberg. For four years running Bill has organized groups of northern Virginia volunteers to work in the new starts for a few days in February. Hoping to find a way to support the mission work throughout the year Bill asked Peter Putzier who is managing the urban farm to come up with a wish list of items that would benefit the farm. The list included landscaping fabric a rain gauge a vacuum sealer and other canning supplies a flame weeder and supplies for building a chicken coop.

5551,Dec. 20 2016 3:04 p.m.,Scenes from a Neighborhood School,Ayden Jayden and Latisha made good use of the new playground built for the students this summer. by Sean Connolly Photos: Nano FarabaughA few days before Thanksgiving the relatives of Praise Academy’s 13 students—mothers aunts grandmothers a great-grandmother one father and many little brothers and sisters—came to the school for a holiday lunch. They carried in platters of mustard greens green beans rolls potatoes sweet potatoes cranberry sauce and stuffing. Once inside they wrote on cut-out paper leaves what they were thankful for—for Praise Academy for friendships and family members—then attached them with yarn to the Thankful Tree a branch set in a vase. They toured the school admiring the students’ work: tissue paper versions of Monet’s water lilies a model of the solar system made from Styrofoam balls quizzes about the planets and handwriting samples. The students performed a hymn for their relatives singing “Here in the love of Christ I stand.” Joan Pingel the principal led a prayer and announced that the students would serve the meal and saw how the mothers raised their eyebrows and smiled in a surprised and impressed way. After the meal the students served four pies that they had made (apple chocolate lemon and pumpkin). The relatives filed out of the school and the students began clearing away the plates and sweeping the floors.This was a normal healthy and happy scene one that any community member would feel at home in but I can’t help but see it through the lens of our first years in the neighborhood back when a few long-haired white kids started going door to door to talk about God’s dreams for Allendale and Lakeside when we were easily mistaken for burial insurance salesmen or narcs back when just this sort of scene would have been impossible. Death and decay dominated the area symbolized by the rotten and collapsing shacks the pop-pop-pop of gunshots at night the gang murders making headlines. Yet even then the seeds of this scene were buried in our neighbors’ hearts. In those early conversations neighbors told us again and again that their biggest concern was for the children that they wanted to protect them from the drugs and violence to get kids off the street and to secure their futures. Today Praise Academy has become a beating heart for a younger neighborhood while the rest of the neighbors are the muscles tendons hard bones and leathery skin forming around the heart to shelter and nurture it to celebrate its growth and ensure that it keeps beating. Each morning and afternoon that forming happens as many of those same relatives arrive to drop off or pick up their children some in cars others on foot. Sometimes the moms linger a while talking with one another. After school one of the grandmothers walks three of the children not her own descendants back to her house wishing to help a neighbor family with two working parents.

To celebrate we've posted here our article on Betty and her husband Francis from the June 2008 issue of V&B. Enjoy! Francis and Betty Johnson: A Perpetual Motion Machine for Good by Sean Connolly Photos: Chris Meehan Drive through the lush and rain-forested city of Corvallis Oregon and you’re bound to come across some of the handiwork of Francis and Betty Johnson. Francis 82 is a master builder a jack-of-all-trades who has maintained Oregon State University buildings put up homes and used his coarse meaty hands to drag steelhead and sturgeon out of Oregon’s waterways. Betty 85 is a social servant who has started six nonprofit organizations written grant proposals and lobbied legislators working tirelessly so that seniors can live independently in their own homes. Together the Johnsons are a whirlwind for good married for 55 years and still rapidly turning.   Throughout the Corvallis branch the Johnsons’ house is known as the Johnson Hotel where travelers strangers and families find first-rate food and friends. The Johnson Hotel  Throughout the Corvallis branch and beyond the Johnsons’ big barn-red house is known as the Johnson Hotel. Francis and Betty have welcomed families transients students parish members and community members from Hawaii New Orleans Saskatoon and South Bend. A single man stayed with them for two and a half years and a homeless woman moved in one New Year’s Eve carrying her possessions in eight plastic bags. Their only regret is that they never kept a guest book. For four months in 2001 the Johnsons hosted John and Mary Lou Carey and their three children. The Johnsons and Careys had been neighbors for years sharing chores and gardens cars a well and even joint ownership of a cow. Betty likes to refer to “the conveyor belt” between their two homes. However seven years ago that close sharing nearly came to an end.  John and Mary Lou Carey The Careys own a two-story duplex but health problems had made walking the stairs troublesome for Mary Lou. John tried to come up with ways to expand the main floor so they could live there comfortably but he couldn’t think of a way to make it work. He was heartbroken at the thought of moving. Then in the car on the way to a men’s retreat Francis had an idea. “The Holy Spirit zapped him” John recalls. “Francis asked if anyone had an envelope and he sketched out the remodeling of our house.” That sketch became the plan. Later that day Francis pulled John aside. “I’ll help you every step of the way” he said. “You can come live with us.” John and Mary Lou moved into the Johnsons’ living room stretching a sheet across the doorway for some privacy. Before and after John’s workdays at Hewlett-Packard he and Francis worked on the house. “We couldn’t afford to hire a contractor” John says. “We subcontracted out the skilled parts of the job but Francis and I did the plumbing electrical and flooring ourselves. He was the brains of the operation. He gave us a garage living room and dining room area and a brand new kitchen. He created a paradise for us.” Constructing Community  The Johnsons moved to Corvallis from Kansas City Missouri in 1970 carrying their four children along with them. They wanted to leave the big city behind choosing Corvallis because it was close to water close to a university (Oregon State) and within reach of classical music and opera venues in Portland. They bought a Coast to Coast hardware store and started attending St. Mary’s the only Catholic Church in town. One Sunday they missed morning mass and instead went to an evening student mass where Fr. Charlie Harris was preaching. “His homily just blew us away” Francis remembers. “After that we would try to find out which mass he was going to be at so we could hear him preach.” The Johnsons enjoyed Charlie’s preaching but they didn’t go to the charismatic prayer meetings he was leading at their parish. Then one day in 1976 they attended a fortuitous outdoor birthday party with some of the prayer meeting folks. “Some of the men standing around the fire were talking about forming a community” Francis recalls. “I walked away because what they were saying sounded like a foreign language. But later I came back and started listening a little more.” The next Saturday Francis met with Ted Gregg to learn more about community. “We talked for about three hours. I told him we wanted to be a part of that. Then I talked it over with Betty. The rest is history.”  In the late 1970s Francis Johnson and other Corvallis branch handymen such as Terry Hackenbruck and Chris Taylor helped build Christian Village a cluster of 10 homes on some former farmland just outside Corvallis. They started in 1977. Charlie Harris the Johnsons Hackenbrucks Nathmans Taylors Wagners and a few other families bought 12 acres of rolling farmland together just beyond the Corvallis city limits. They planned to build houses and live close together calling this proto-city-building effort Christian Village. Many of the men were contractors or skilled workers who put up their own houses and helped one another along the way. Francis remembers a roofing party that involved 22 men and boys beginning 8:00 a.m. and ending at noon with a completed roof. Sweat cemented the Johnsons’ relationships with their new brothers and sisters. “It was a great transition” Betty says. “One way that you build relationships is to roll up your sleeves and work side by side.”  Chris and Colette Taylor Francis and Chris Taylor started Christian Construction Company together with Ted and Chris’s brother Frank. The company oversaw construction of five out of 10 Christian Village houses and then went on to build more homes around Corvallis.  Christian Village from the air. The Johnsons’ home is the red building in the center. Fr. Charlie Harris moved into Christian Village in 1977 taking up residence in an old farmhouse next door to the Johnsons. He and Francis grew to be friends fishing and gardening together and even learning to keep bees. The Johnsons and Charlie celebrated anniversaries and birthdays together with pies and home-cooked meals and did so until his death in 1988. “He and I were close brothers” Francis says. Helping Seniors Live at Home  When the Johnsons were running their hardware store Betty felt like a fish out of water. She says she resigned from the job because she “couldn’t tell one kind of paint from another.” In 1972 she got a job as the director of the Area Agency on Aging developing services for senior citizens in three counties. “When I started there was almost nothing available for older people in health and social services” she remembers. She drafted a plan for a senior meals program and helped start a transportation service called Dial-A-Bus. Later she and others organized one of the first Hospice chapters in the state providing home health care for many. All three programs are still going strong. “The most satisfying thing to me was that we were building a long-term care system that allowed people to stay at home” she says. “I’m the first person who will send people to nursing homes if they really need it but I try to help people stay in their own homes as long as they can.” Betty and Francis have expanded that effort since their retirements in 1987. Betty helped start Volunteer Interfaith Caregivers in 1986 and still directs the organization. The board is actively trying to replace her but they can’t find anyone to take on her load. The 200 or so volunteers she coordinates visit elderly residents in their homes take them grocery shopping drive them to medical appointments and even build wheelchair ramps for them. Francis oversaw the construction of more than 50 wheelchair ramps in 2007 alone leading crews of retired men who call him “Boss” and like to eat the cookies he bakes on their breaks.  Francis Johnson supervised the construction of more than 50 wheelchair ramps in 2007. Together Betty Francis and others dreamed up promoted fundraised for and in 2002 finished building Corvallis Caring Place an assisted-living center for 42 residents. Francis served on the board until recently and Betty is still a board member. Caring Place is the only assisted-living facility in Corvallis that accepts residents on Medicaid but it doesn’t look or feel institutional. Residents sit around chatting cheerily in the large naturally lit dining room. They get their hair done in the beauty salon and tend flowers in the garden.

Betty’s work with seniors got her interested in health-care reform. In 1991 she started Mid-Valley Health Care Advocates to work to bring health insurance and high-quality health care to the 600000 Oregonians who are uninsured. Today she travels regularly to Salem and Portland to meet with other advocates. She’s on a committee that’s drafting sections of a health-care reform bill they hope will go before the Oregon legislature in 2009.  Though Francis is less active now—he suffers from chronic headaches—Betty still volunteers 50 hours a week. Her schedule is a tour de force: on a recent Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. she found out that she was expected to give a presentation on health-care reform the very next day in Portland. That evening she stayed up talking to Francis until 10:30 and then began typing her presentation finishing up around 2:00 a.m. The next morning she traveled 90 miles to Portland gave her presentation and came back in time to welcome houseguests. Betty’s activities bring about 20 emails each day. She responds to most of them checking her messages throughout the day even just before bed.  Francis bakes biscuits. Love Like Breathing  Fifty-five years into their marriage Francis and Betty are still very much in love. Late in the evenings you can find them playing dominoes together at the dining room table or sitting on the sofa eating popcorn and cookies surrounded by Francis’s fishing posters. “Some people ask us if we ever had a second honeymoon” says Francis chuckling. “We’re still living off of our first.” Of course they worry about each other—Francis about Betty’s frenetic pace Betty about Francis’s headaches. If you ask the Johnsons what keeps this whirlwind turning you’ll get short and straightforward replies. “Fundamentally we both love the Lord and we know he loves us” says Betty. “The next step is How do you love others? To me it’s just like breathing.” Francis simply quotes Scripture “Christ lives in me.” Betty adds “We have the support of our brothers and sisters who love us. That helps us to fill up our tank so that we can continue to reach out.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5614

5493,Nov. 2 2016 4:17 p.m.,Meet the Board: Nick Holovaty,by George Kane Photo: Mary TimlerNick Holovaty was well prepared for a missionary calling by the example of his parents and grandparents.His mother’s side includes Presbyterian missionaries sent to Brazil and to the Belgian Congo. His paternal grandfather fled Stalin’s invasion of Ukraine and was eventually ordained a Ukrainian Catholic priest in Canada.In 1990 when Nick was 10 his parents Orest and Susan (Evansville) took Nick and his sister Claire from Wheaton IL to Moscow Russia. There Orest worked for a Christian foundation supporting churches and missions across the Soviet Union.“My parents’ example showed me that it is worth taking great risks so people have the opportunity to hear the gospel” Nick says.He remembers the evangelists who came to the Holovatys’ home for lunch. “It was in talking to these fervent men from all over the former Soviet Union many of whom had spent time in Communist prisons on account of their faith that my desire to serve the Lord through evangelism took root.”In 1999 Nick enrolled in St. John’s College in Annapolis MD where he began to search for a deeper experience of the Holy Spirit and Christian community. Fluent in Russian he had explored a call to the missions in Russia through an internship with a group of charismatic Russian Orthodox Christians. But he ultimately found what he was looking for in South Bend where the rest of the family had established a stateside home so Claire could attend Trinity School. “When I moved to South Bend the South Bend branch found me a place to live a job and a role playing guitar at the Campus Fellowship meetings. I was amazed to find men who were both spiritual and practical and I realized i wanted to be like them.” He enrolled at Notre Dame was baptized in the Spirit and joined the community in February 2001.The next two years were pivotal. Nick took a break from school and began working for the community absorbing our way of thinking from Paul DeCelles and Mary Frances Sparrow. He later returned to Notre Dame and graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA. In February 2002 following the 2001 High Country Adventure Paul sent Nick Sean and J-T on a three-week road trip to seek out a location where high school students could work in the summer. They eventually found Allendale which became the site of the first Action summer later that year.Nick soon became a leader in the movement of young people who were working to contribute to the community through city-building. He helped lead the first household of single men and women in Allendale in 2004 before moving to the Twin Cities to help with the campus division in Dinkytown. He led and helped found the Company a group of young men who commit themselves to being trained and deployed for the mission work of the community.In 2007 Craig Lent appointed Nick as the community’s Mission program coordinator and Nick became a founding member of a new group of People of Praise missionaries the Missionary Company who live together in households and embrace poverty for the sake of the gospel. Nick moved to Indianapolis and later to Evansville helping to launch new starts in both locations. In 2011 he made a commitment to be single for the Lord for the sake of the community’s mission work. He was elected to the board of governors in 2014.Nick plays the guitar and banjo and enjoys writing songs from playful ditties about the small towns he’s encountered on his travels to hymn lyrics for the missionary choir.“Nick’s missionary background and fervor for evangelism his deep understanding of household life and his experience building Christian community are all tremendous assets for our life” Craig says. “He is also an excellent musician.”Paul DeCelles adds “Nick together with his companions has taken the community to a new frontier the Gospel to the poor.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5493
5489,Nov. 2 2016 4:17 p.m.,Meet the Board: John Zwerneman,by Chris Meehan Photo: Margaret AndersonJohn Zwerneman was 21 when his parents Jim and Nancy and three of his four siblings moved from New Mexico to South Bend to join the People of Praise.“I fell in love with community immediately” he remembers. “There was so much joy common purpose intense and fantastic relationships brotherhood and the love of God. I was thrilled.”The Zwernemans forged strong relationships quickly and had to lean on them when Nancy died of cancer less than a year later.John moved to North Carolina for medical school and then on to Phoenix for a residency in internal medicine. There he met Amy Gilloon through the People of Joy community. John and Amy married in 1983 and they have five children: James 31 Peter 29 Mary 27 Johnny 25 and Annie Kadeli 23 (northern Virginia).After medical school the People of Praise sent John and Amy on assignment to Israel for one year to assist the People of Joy community in their new mission in Jerusalem. John volunteered at a children’s health clinic and made house calls in the Muslim quarter. John Amy and James lived in the Old City where John enjoyed shopping for food in the street markets.After Jerusalem the community asked them to move to Grenada. The Zwernemans spent six years on the island with John serving as the mission branch leader while practicing medicine at a small clinic. The family lived on four acres planted with nutmeg cocoa and bananas. John raised chickens and traded the meat and eggs with neighbors for pork and vegetables. Three of their children were born in Grenada.The Zwernemans returned to the US in 1992 moving to Phoenix where John began a second residency in psychiatry. After John finished his residency they moved back to South Bend. John was appointed as an area coordinator and in 2002 was appointed to the first of two six-year terms as principal branch coordinator.During that time John was “an energetic and remarkably effective leader all the while maintaining a full-time job as a psychiatrist” says Craig Lent. “He was busy yet available. He did an amazing job and was much beloved in the branch.”At one branch meeting he illustrated the abundant and overflowing love of God by pouring a bottle of red wine into a glass until it overflowed delighting many in the branch. “He is a gifted and great communicator” said Rich Was who followed John as PBC.Molly Barrett who works at the South Bend branch office says John was not only a good manager but a faithful brother in the Lord. “His parents were old friends of my parents Gene and Jo Geissler. After John’s parents died he treated my parents with similar affection and loyalty. He was such a source of comfort to them and they trusted his advice. If I happened to mention at work any difficulties either of my parents was having John would be sure to squeeze in a visit to them at his earliest opportunity.”John was elected to the board of governors in 2014. He loves cooking and has put his love for food on display at the board’s annual retreats. With Amy and his children he started a small publishing house Wiggins Press to publish a children’s book series called The Adventures of Ta and Boddington written and illustrated by his son James which many community children have enjoyed.In the summer of 2016 John and Amy began traveling to the Rockford and Appleton branches on behalf of Kevin Ranaghan and the branch relations team.“Serving the community is our delight” he says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5489

5470,Oct. 18 2016 11:24 a.m.,Stories from Urban Farming - Evansville,"Peter Putzier sent us this story about the Urban Farm in Evansville: God continues to bless our efforts to expand the Urban Farm (Praise Harvest) in Evansville. A couple of weeks ago there was a word at the local community meeting which I remember as ""multiply your efforts"". The word stuck with me and I began looking for ways to respond. In the following two weeks I experienced several instances of God sending people to me who multiplied my efforts!   We are covering the space between our raised bed gardens with mulch that was dropped off for free after we sent a request in to the city arborist. The mulch was dumped in an empty space across the street from our garden plot to allow trucks room for maneuvering. This left us with A LOT of mulch to move across the street. One day I was out moving mulch and a man arrived at a nearby empty lot on a tractor. He spent about 30 minutes mowing the empty lot and when he finished he drove over and said ""You're making me feel guilty watching you work so hard. Would you like some help!"" The man who was a volunteer mower for the non-profit land owner proceeded to move mulch with me for an hour with the front end loader on his tractor. He moved half of the mulch. God was looking out for us by sending support through this generous man!  A second story: We have a neighbor in his late sixties who often stops to chat on the way to the bus stop. The man (who is always wearing a wide brimmed straw hat) has experience in small engine repair. Once when he stopped by to talk and I asked ""When are you going to help me fix our rototiller?"" He said ""Just let me know when you're working on it."" The following Saturday he and I worked on our broken rototiller (one tool in our fleet of cheap or donated tools that don't function at 100%!). Among other things he adjusted the distance between the magnet and fly wheel with a folded dollar bill. Within 45 minutes ""we"" had the tiller running! Praise God for multiplying our efforts through the help of our neighbors.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5470
5463,Oct. 5 2016 11:42 a.m.,South Bend Girls Discover Honey Making,Some of the girls from the South Bend branch went on a field trip to learn about beekeeping October 2nd. Thanks to Mary Lee who sent in this piece about it: On a sunny but chilly Saturday morning this Fall 12 girls aged 7 to11 and their leaders from the South Bend branch carpooled to Ken and Pam Peterson’s home where they were warmly greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Peterson and their dog Bailey. The girls were ushered into a fragrant and somewhat stuffy room off the Petersons’ kitchen where they crowded around a table laden with close to a hundred pounds of honey in jars of every shape and size. The only uniform thing about the jars was their amber color and the round white label bearing the name Church Yard Farms affixed to each lid. The jars of translucent honey seemed to glow as they captured the light that was flooding in through a nearby window.  Reverend Peterson a saintly looking retired Lutheran pastor had sort of stumbled upon the hobby of beekeeping after retirement when his son’s neighbor casually mentioned that his trees had never been so fruitful as when another neighbor was keeping bees. Of course (Mr. Peterson had an epiphany)! Fruit is produced when birds bees and to a lesser extent the wind carry pollen from one flower to another. So one reasons the more bees you have around the more fruit you will get! Thus began a journey of discovery that has evolved into a small time beekeeping operation with 16 hives scattered over 7 locations around the Michiana area.  The girls who were there to learn about beekeeping were enrapt as Mr. Peterson explained in great detail the life of a hive: what the three main types of bees are who work together to maintain the hive how they build honeycomb how they raise offspring how they forage for pollen and how they store up food for the winter (which we benefit from). They were alternately terrified and amazed when he dressed in full white protective garb opened a hive and pulled out a tray of honeycomb that was covered in massive clumps of bees busily going about the business of making honey. Back inside his house they clustered (like bees) around Mr. Peterson as he carefully sliced the outer layer of wax off of a honeycomb squealing in delight as the honey began to ooze out and chanting counted the number of cranks of the handle it took him to extract the honey using his beekeeper’s centrifuge.  As I watched the girls and felt their excitement I was moved almost to tears but I was not immediately aware of why. Was it that this is the kind of thing I tend to care about: people like Ken acquiring important basic skills and knowledge that humans have relied on for millennia (but that have been nearly lost in the modern world) and exposing kids to that knowledge and those skills? My instincts told me there was something deeper going on. After a lot of thought and reflection I realized that as I experienced Ken’s delight in his bees and watched the girls entering into his delight I was witnessing the Lord delighting in and caring for his creation through Ken. And the thought came to me this is a holy occupation.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5463

Hurricane Matthew passed by us without causing any damage at all. We had three rain showers last night and it was heavily overcast but already we are back to normal. “It is nothing like we expected. We thought there was nothing we could do to avoid it. We did our best to prepare then sat back to wait. The country basically shut down. There was an unusual calmness in the air. We thought it was the calm before a storm but then we didn't get the usual winds that typically precede a storm. There was a little flooding in one section of Kingston but nothing affected branch members praise God. “We did not have to cancel any meetings–we don't have meetings on the first Sunday of the month any way.

5365,Sept. 21 2016 10:34 a.m.,The Dusty Palace: Building Lives and Furniture in Grand Rapids and Beyond,Coleman Moore and Mark Petersen look at wood samples in the showroom of The Custom Cottage furniture shop in Grand Rapids Michigan. by Sean Connolly Photos: Margaret Anderson Sean Connolly and Courtesy of the Custom Cottage The Custom Cottage is a furniture shop in Grand Rapids Michigan located in the back of a red brick factory that covers a city block. The factory’s tall Italianate tower hovers over the surrounding neighborhood like a church steeple. Inside a thick yellow-green dust has settled everywhere—on the saws stacks of boards and worktables on bunk beds queen beds bookshelves and dining tables on a black leather Bible that rests on a small table near the entry even on the shop’s founder Coleman Moore. He is a shorter man of 60 in jeans a faded work shirt and a pair of aquamarine glasses that bring out the bright blue-green color of his eyes. With two pencils poking out from his pocket he looks the part of a lifelong furniture builder. But he was many other things—a real estate developer a student at nearby Calvin Seminary a pastor and a church planter—before he built his first piece of furniture. Even then he had no idea that a one-off project for his wife would become a business or that he would employ ex-cons alcoholics drug addicts homeless men and returned soldiers training them to become craftsmen. Like Coleman this place took me by surprise. When I first came into his shop my mission was simple enough: to plan the construction of a dining room table for my growing family in South Bend. I had no idea that God might want to open a similar furniture shop in Evansville a place where our neighbors might one day come to find that most precious of modern human necessities—a job.  * * *Coleman Moore grew up in the mountains of east Tennessee. His father was an executive who traveled often so busy with work that as Coleman recalled he only came to one of his son’s baseball games. “If I was going to spend any time with him the only opportunity was to do what he was doing” Coleman said. That meant working alongside him in the basement wood shop where father and son built shelves for the house and a pergola for the backyard. The son took to the work making his own Soap Box Derby car and a pontoon boat from Styrofoam and cedar. None of this seemed relevant to Coleman’s career path. After college he became an executive with a real estate development company. He managed a development in downtown Dallas with three office buildings and a 12-story hotel with an ice skating rink in the atrium. By the world’s standards he and his wife Mary were doing fine with three children a house and a cottage on the Gulf of Mexico. They were churchgoers but largely for their children’s sake. Then one Lent Coleman decided to read the Bible straight through. It took him 18 months but when he got to the end he told Mary that the Bible had “an absolutely radical message.” He said that they should either start living by it or quit pretending to be Christians. They chose the former and eventually God called them to move to Grand Rapids where Coleman enrolled in Calvin Seminary and began studying to be a pastor. To pay the bills Mary began working full-time on a night shift as a labor and delivery nurse giving up the time with her children that she had treasured in her former part-time job. “That was a very very difficult switch for me” she said. Times were tough for the Moores. “The family went to negative cash flow” Coleman said.  After graduation they moved to North Carolina where Coleman started an interracial church called The River. It was there that he also learned about the charismatic movement. At a charismatic conference Coleman heard an invitation to come up for prayer to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. He waited until the last moment then went forward falling to the floor after hands were laid on his head. For 20 minutes he had “an amazing conversation with God.” When he got up he had decided he would not speak for one week. In that silence he began to learn to recognize God’s voice how to distinguish it from the clutter and noise on one hand and the snarling whispers of the enemy on the other. “I wasn’t the same” he said of the experience. The Moores returned to Michigan in 2005 so Coleman could become the pastor of another Reformed church near Grand Rapids. He worked there for five years until it became clear to him that his charismatic spirituality and the church’s more traditional approach would not meld. He was in his mid-50s and unemployed or as he puts it “waiting on my next call.” He figured that a new call would come from a church and began searching for Reformed congregations of a more charismatic bent but no calls came. Then one day in 2012 Mary asked Coleman if he would build a headboard for their bed since she couldn’t find the kind she wanted anywhere. “I’d been looking on Craigslist because we didn’t have a lot of money trying to find a headboard in the shabby-chic style” she said.  Dan Romero is building a 10-foot-long dining room table. Each piece at The Custom Cottage is built to specifications set by the customer. Coleman finished the headboard and posted a picture on Craigslist figuring that if Mary wanted one perhaps others would too. A few orders came in and he began filling them in his garage. The fledgling company soon graduated to a four-car garage then to a 3000-square-foot space in Rockford a Grand Rapids suburb. The orders kept rolling in: for beds for nightstands desks and entertainment centers– so many orders that he hired seven people. The business was growing but Coleman saw it as little more than a stopover. “I’m still thinking Okay Lord when is that church going to open up that you want me to pastor?” That perspective changed on a Sunday in April 2013. Ryan Walkes a guest speaker at his church described the Bridge Street House of Prayer the inner-city ministry he had founded in Grand Rapids. Walkes made a passing comment about how the people they were meeting needed jobs. For Coleman it was a revelation. He saw the purpose of his life laid out before him—to provide jobs for people in the inner city. “The Spirit moved and moved my heart” he said. Walking out of church that day Coleman was asking the Lord what he should do next when God spoke to him in no uncertain terms: Do nothing for two weeks. For a man of action it was a hard message. “I’m not good at waiting” Coleman said. But he waited anyway. Two weeks later early on a Sunday morning he woke up suddenly. God began to speak to him again: Get up now. I am going to give you a vision. Write this down.  “I had a real vision” he explained “to move to the city of Grand Rapids close to where people who were struggling to find jobs would live near a bus route.” God told him that he would provide the space that he would provide the people and that Coleman shouldn’t worry about either. He gave Coleman a phrase which summed up his mission: “Building lives through building furniture.” Coleman began to tell his employees and friends that he would be moving the business to inner-city Grand Rapids. “Everybody I was working with thought I was crazy.” Then on a Sunday morning in June 2013 he woke up and heard God speak to him once more. He had the sense that he should drive to a building he had seen on the Internet an old factory. There he saw a sign advertising space for lease. He called the number and arranged a tour. “It had no door only a fire escape entrance. No docks” Coleman recalled but the price was “unbelievably low.” He signed a lease and The Custom Cottage opened in the old factory in August 2013. His first two employees at the new location came from the Bridge Street House of Prayer ministry.* * *I first heard about The Custom Cottage in the fall of 2013. Their Craigslist ads showed pictures of dining room tables made from old barnwood their long planks revealing the curved swirl marks of ancient steam-driven circular saws. A few weeks later I had to go to Grand Rapids for a conference and managed to stop by the shop. I met Coleman then realized it would be worth returning with my wife Gretchen. When we came back in January we both were excited about building a table but reality set in as we realized we would need to save up the money. It took two years of stashing money from Christmas checks and selling less important possessions but by Christmas 2015 we had met our goal. On a snowy Martin Luther King Day we brought our whole family to the shop to place our order. We were met by Ross Graveling Coleman’s right-hand man. Ross helped us finalize our plans for a table that would be seven feet long by 44 inches wide with two leaves that would take it out to nine feet. It would be made from long maple planks with knots and striations of dark color.  The Custom Cottage showroom in the front of the shop includes beds and tables in a variety of styles. Seven weeks later I returned with Jeremy Osterhouse to carry our table home. As we dusted it off and removed the top for transport Coleman told us more about his approach to the business. The mission of “Building lives through building furniture” shapes many of the practical details of how the business operates leading Coleman to some interesting innovations. One is complete flexibility of scheduling. Each builder has a set of keys and can work any time he wants 24-7. “If they need to be home to take care of the kids if they need to go along on a field trip or be there for a sporting event or a play that’s fine. I encourage that” Coleman said. This means that Coleman never has to hassle or punish a worker who’s late if a car breaks down or if he needs to leave to see his parole officer. Another innovation has to do with pay structure. He pays each of the builders minimum wage—$8.50 an hour in Michigan—and then pays them by the piece on top of that. He said a trained builder should be able to make between $15 and $20 per hour. Some of the workers do earn that much and those who don’t are offered further training.  Elijah Mosley works on a table.  Chris Conley works in the paint room where he paints polyurethanes and stains furniture. He also set up the business so that he rarely will have cause to fire someone. Coleman said there are only two reasons he would consider letting someone go. First if a builder after getting trained demonstrates no aptitude for furniture making. Second if he simply never shows up holding a place that could go to someone else. This means that no one will be fired for drinking on the job cussing out the boss messing up orders or getting tossed in jail for a couple of nights. “I can handle getting cussed out” Coleman said. The shop employs 10 people and Coleman said turnover is very low. Business comes in with help from Craigslist Facebook and word of mouth but Coleman said that God ultimately runs their marketing department and Coleman relies on God to bring in enough orders to keep everyone busy. “There have been times when we’ve had lots of orders to fill” he said. There have been slow times too but “we’ve never had a time when there has not been at least one order on the desk to fill.” Impressed I told others in the community about Coleman and the shop including Nick Holovaty who is responsible for the Mission program office and my boss Paul DeCelles who has overall responsibility for our mission work. We had been talking about how we could employ our neighbors in our mission locations and we wondered whether Coleman’s model might work. Paul suggested I return to the shop and write this story.* * *I returned in March hoping to meet some of the builders and learn about their experience. I arrived in time for lunch which the builders eat together each day. They share stories from their lives in an atmosphere of brotherhood that reminded me of a men’s group. A time of prayer follows lunch with one of the workers reading a Bible passage and a short reflection.  Each day at the shop the workers gather for lunch and a time of prayer swapping stories and praying for one another’s needs. Elijah Mosley is a 37-year-old African American a husband and father of seven children. He’s the most experienced builder and the natural leader on the shop floor. He said he’s built every kind of piece the shop produces and he has a fierce pride in his work borne out in the pictures he takes and posts to Facebook. “To build something you have to see it in your head” he told me. “It’s like a big puzzle. That’s the whole joy of what I do. You are able to take something and make it your own. It’s a craft.” He told me the story of a woman who saved her money for 15 months to buy a bedroom set then came in and paid for the whole thing in cash rather than putting down a deposit like everybody else. Eli saw the joy she had when she finally received her furniture and would not forget it. Eli also had a warning for me. He wanted me to know that not all the employees had troubled pasts and even those who did should not be seen in light of those pasts. They are builders now and the mission of the shop belongs not just to Coleman but to them. “I feel it’s us the workers that keep the company driving keep Coleman on his toes” he said.  Eli Mosley’s workstation features a sign made by one of his seven children. Another builder Mark Petersen 59 is clean-shaven in jeans and a gray t-shirt. Like Eli he also posts pictures of his work to Facebook and he talked proudly of a barnwood table with a trestle base painted light green that is featured in The Custom Cottage ads. When I met him Mark had been working at the shop for a little more than a year. He said that two years earlier he’d spent time in jail on a drunk driving charge. He’d been out of jail for only a month when he learned that he had stage three cancer in his neck. After chemotherapy and radiation treatments it took him more than a year to recover then he went to work at The Custom Cottage. “I live by myself” he said. “I don’t have a family and because of my past my finan - cial situation isn’t the greatest so it’s nice to be able to make extra money when I need to. It also keeps me out of trouble. You live by yourself you get bored at home you get tired and a lot of times it’s like man I need to get out of here I need to go do something and you end up doing something you might regret go to the bar but instead you just go to your job make some money and keep yourself out of trouble. It’s been a very good plan for me. “I’m still on parole right now. I’ve got about six months left. There’s just no way I want to take any chances. Getting into the system is extremely easy. Getting out is extremely hard.”* * *Two weeks later I was back in the shop. I had asked Coleman if he would take me through the same training he gives the other builders. I brought along Rus Lyons one of our missionaries who wanted to see if something like this shop might work in Evansville. Coleman said we would begin like all the builders do by making a bed. He got us started by sketching a plan for the bed a job the builder himself would normally do. (Planning is one of the hardest skills to master and Coleman wants each builder to learn how to do it.) Next he explained the shop’s system of building which involves putting wood together in layers. By the end of the first day with Coleman standing close by to answer questions I had finished putting together the headboard while Rus had begun working on a set of storage cubbies that would slide under the bed. The next day I built the end rail and began the long slow process of sanding everything.  Rus Lyons at his work table where he was building a king-sized bed. While working on the end rail I made my first big mistake. I was using a power hand planer to smooth the top of a leg so the three layers would be flush. The planer hit a ridge and kicked back sending a crack through one of the leg boards. I thought I had ruined it but Coleman said we would glue it. He told me that a lot of builders expect to be punished when they make mistakes and they’re surprised when they aren’t. Coleman sees this in light of the gospel. “How many chances does Jesus give us? Two three four in essence an infinite number of chances. So how many chances are we going to give each other?” When the bed was finally ready to assemble Mark came by and gave it a shake. It had quite a wobble and my heart wobbled along with it. I figured a legion of rookie mistakes had added up creating a permanent instability. But the story wasn’t over. It turned out we hadn’t secured the brackets properly. Once they were locked down we shook the bed again and it hardly moved. Mark gave me a fist bump.  Sean Connolly and Rus Lyons built this bed together out of maple and barnwood while Sean was working on this story and Rus was discerning whether to pursue an apprenticeship at the shop. The thrill of building is hard to describe. It felt like a runner’s high and stayed with me for some time. I could only imagine how good it would feel to someone who had spent years in prison or living on the streets–a thrill that no drug or crime could induce and that no Boss or Government Agent could ever take away. Before Rus and I headed home after our training Coleman said “I tell you what you guys sure qualified to be builders.” We would have made the cut and that only added to the thrill. We were pumped! For Rus passing this training meant more. After praying and talking with Nick Paul and the other missionaries he accepted an offer from Coleman to apprentice at the shop. In May he moved to Grand Rapids for six months to a year. Coleman will teach Rus every aspect of the business: building the pieces painting and staining them fixing mistakes marketing and advertising sales accounting etc. Rus’s intention is to open a furniture shop in Evansville on The Custom Cottage model and Coleman has agreed to help him get it started.   Two photos of a trestle table built by Mark Petersen a design that has been popular with customers. Coleman told me that talking with Rus has expanded his vision. He very much likes the idea that a furniture shop in Evansville would not only be transforming individual lives but be part of “something bigger that God is doing”—the transformation of an entire neighborhood and community. In one of our later conversations I asked Coleman about the name of the business. He told me it was inspired by a parable in C.S. Lewis’s Mere Christianity: “Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first perhaps you understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. “What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building a quite different house than the one you thought of—throwing out a new wing here putting on an extra floor there running up towers making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself.” The parable is a fitting metaphor for Coleman’s life–a real estate developer turned pastor who fully expected to build a church of a certain predictable type. But it turned out God wanted to build something else a dusty palace a place where each day he would go to work alongside his friends Coleman Eli Mark and the others building lives and building furniture. The building continues. Rus said “When I was driving from Evansville up to Grand Rapids for one of my first visits I saw one of my neighbors who right now is homeless has a son and spends more time with his son than quite a number of folks who have houses and jobs. I was filled with this searing love that the Father has for him and overcome with this desire to help him provide for himself so that he could provide for his son. And I knew one hundred percent that the Lord was calling me to start a business where he could do that.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5365
5362,Sept. 21 2016 10:31 a.m.,Travel Team: The Long and Winding Service of the Sklorenkos,Stu and Jennifer Ambrose with the Sklorenkos at a Hawaiian-themed party given in the Sklorenkos honor in Rockford on April 30. by Elizabeth Grams Photos: Courtesy of David and Sharon Sklorenko Stu Ambrose and Barb Stahl Since 1980 David and Sharon Sklorenko have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles on the community’s behalf. Appleton Cincinnati Colorado Springs Dominica Grenada Kingston Memphis Rockford Yakima . . . the Sklorenkos have been to them all visiting prayer groups and branches. (They’ve been to all 21 locations where the community currently has branches). In June of 2016 after more than 35 years of travel and service the Sklorenkos made their last official branch visit to Buffalo. David formally retired from his role as Mission coordinator on July 1 a few months shy of his 80th birthday. But before all of those trips in the 1970s the Sklorenkos were living in Hawaii where David had founded or run a number of businesses involving road construction landscaping property development and warehousing. They had four children. They were founding members of a Catholic parish and were active in a charismatic prayer group. . . . They were an active couple. Clem and Julie Walters recall meeting them in 1978 when members of the prayer group in Hawaii took them unannounced to the Sklorenkos’ home. “There were David and Sharon and all the children from the oldest to the youngest working on a very dirty project moving stones” Clem said. “I thought to myself that guy can really do something—he can organize kids!” Julie recalls how Sharon immediately dropped what she was doing to welcome her guests to an impromptu meal and visit in their home. After the Sklorenkos attended the charismatic Kansas City conference in 1977 David felt a tug from the Lord to join covenant community on the mainland. The Sklorenko family moved from Hawaii to South Bend in 1979 leaving behind businesses family members and friends as well as the prayer group (which went on to became the Oahu branch of the People of Praise). “It was a leap of faith” says Sharon. “It seemed like a lot to leave everything but the minute I got to South Bend it just seemed right. I never looked back.” In South Bend David’s business expertise was put to use for the community right away. He took on management of the LaSalle Building managed the community’s bookstore and restaurant there and worked in the conference office of Charismatic Renewal Services (CRS) which was administering national charismatic conferences hosting thousands of people. Sharon worked in the building too first helping out in the restaurant then joining David in the conference office.  In February of 1997 the Sklorenkos were visiting the Kingston branch when couples from Appleton Rockford and South Bend visiting the island for vacations met up with them at a park. In 1980 they began visiting prayer groups and fledgling communities sprouting out of the charismatic renewal to train them in what the People of Praise had learned about community life. That work became part of the Christians in Mission program office after it was founded in 1981 and Overall Coordinator Paul DeCelles later appointed David to be a Mission coordinator. In the following years the Sklorenkos helped several of those groups through the process of becoming branches of the People of Praise. Over time their work naturally shifted from relating to prayer groups to relating to branches. David became the coordinator responsible for the branches in Appleton Grenada Kingston Rockford and Yakima. Sharon took on a handmaid-like role which Dawn Keaveny (Kingston) described: “She was always concerned about every woman in the branch and on every visit inquired how each was doing. She loved our children and they loved her in return earning her the title ‘Aunty Sharon.’ She shared practical advice about family marriage sisterhood and generally what it means to be a godly woman.” They did all this while David served as a coordinator in the South Bend branch and Sharon both served as a handmaid and worked at CRS assisting Vice-President Pat Rath. At the same time they were raising their children and opening their home to household members to David’s aunt and Sharon’s mother. David was also administering conferences across the US and he was intimately involved in several key property deals: securing the community centers in Rockford and Appleton buying the community’s first properties in Allendale and overseeing construction at the LaSalle Company’s new warehouse and office. The Sklorenkos were so often on the road that David eventually became a member of the American Airlines Two Million Miler program. They were known for their undaunted cheerfulness. Maureen McDonough (South Bend) whose friendship with Sharon goes back to the days they waitressed in the Lasalle Restaurant together notes that she never heard Sharon complain. “She never loved to travel but she was always ready to go in an instant when the Lord said ‘Go’” Maureen said. In September of 1988 Hurricane Gilbert swept through Jamaica destroying buildings and cutting off supplies. After the storm David and Sharon took the first flight they could get into the country to support the brothers and sisters in the recently established Kingston branch. In New York’s Kennedy Airport they discovered that the crates of canned goods they brought along wouldn’t be allowed on the plane so they bought a bunch of duffle bags and hurriedly repacked the food in those. “In the midst of our difficulties God sent Dave and Sharon from South Bend to encourage us” wrote Andre Johnstone in a 1989 Vine & Branches article. “They stayed with us for one week and experienced with us the difficulties of having no water no electricity no bread.” “David and Sharon represented and exhibited the spirit and the lived experience of the covenant that we had committed to” said Dominic Jeremiah the head of the branch leaders’ team in Grenada. “When they visited they would literally put down their bags from a long and exhausting flight and start assisting with laundry or folding clothes or choosing to go visit a brother or sister who needed to chat with them. David’s skillful diplomacy also opened many doors with leaders of the local church and established our community as a positive presence.”  In the fall of 1990 David and Sharon Sklorenko visited the branch in Grenada. Included in the photo are Jim and Beth Bulger (Servant Branch) and John and Amy Zwerneman (South Bend) who are continuing the Sklorenkos’ work in branch relations as well as Sheila Loughran (South Bend) and Edwardlina Sylvester (Grenada). Mike Madden (Appleton) points out that despite the breadth of David and Sharon’s relationships “You always feel like you are the only one in the room when they listen to you.” Jennifer Ambrose (Rockford) says “When Stu’s father died they pitched in and helped empty and clean up the house. They’ve been to our kids’ baptisms; we’ve been to one another’s parents’ funerals. They’ve had our backs administering a hug or a slap–whichever was necessary. And they know how to laugh.” The Sklorenkos have passed the baton to others. Jim and Beth Bulger (Servant Branch) began relating to the branches in Kingston and Grenada in 2014 and John and Amy Zwerneman (South Bend) began relating to the Appleton and Rockford branches in July 2016. Kevin Ranaghan started working with the Sklorenkos in 1996 and has continued to do so ever since then in his capacity as the head of the community’s branch relations team. “The branch relations team and many of our branches will sorely miss David and Sharon” he said. “They brought teaching understanding of the wider community and real-life wisdom into each branch. In a genuinely heartfelt way they have been friends to all forging bonds of love and care that will outlast their many years of service.” David and Sharon are celebrating their retirement in a way that should not be surprising: by packing their bags for a trip to Alaska.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5362

Before they could do that the great flood of 2016 had flooded Beverly's house as well as Rose's sister's house and the houses or yards of most of their other family members in town. While Bill and Rose were on their way to St. Amant their car broke down. They were stranded for two hours before a state police car came and assisted them to get their car towed. They ended up spending the night in the last room at the small hotel where Rose's sister was staying. Rose had been praying throughout the ordeal and had the idea to call the New Orleans branch to see if they could get a ride home. Liz was available to drive the two-hour round-trip drive to pick them up and bring them back to Metairie where most of the New Orleans branch lives. While they cooled off and ate some red beans and rice at the Slatterys' house Steve Gaudet (Mobile) drove to New Orleans to pick them up and bring them the rest of the way home.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5335

In its second year the camp's theme was 'Being a Disciple'. Kids learned about the twelve apostles and simple ways to be a disciple themselves. Branch member Andre Johnstone describes a discipleship exercise:""Each child was given bottles of cold water to distribute to the public on the picnic site. On each bottle of water we had pasted the scripture 'I am the living water. Anyone who drinks of me will never thirst again'. The children went out in groups of twos and threes and as they handed each bottle of water they said what they had been practicing 'Hello would you like a cool bottle of water? Remember that Jesus is the living water'. Some of the children were a bit hesitant at the first approach they made but once they realized that most people were open and receptive they became bold and confident.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5301
5236,Aug. 3 2016 8:43 a.m.,Summer Camps in New Starts Draw Hundreds,By Chris Meehan and Sean ConnollyPhotos by Cathy Walters Ellen Putzier Mary Timler and Thomas Brophy    More than 300 children attended camps sponsored by the community’s Action and Mission divisions this summer. The camps took place in three locations: Shreveport’s Allendale neighborhood the South Side of Indianapolis and for the first time in Evansville Indiana.  “I am so grateful for the generosity of so many high school and college students from around the community as well as the adults who volunteered” said Mike Zusi the community’s Action program coordinator. “As one student said to me every place you look in these neighborhoods you can see Christ working. We are so blessed to be able to be part of that work.”   Evansville The Evansville camp was a three-week affair that the staff hoped would draw 20 or 30 children from the area. But on the first day 38 children arrived and by the end of the three weeks a total of 106 children had attended the camp.  Jo Zimmel a retired physical education teacher from Servant Branch led the effort training staff members and planning activities which included launching bottle rockets and making foam with “Mr. Science” Jo’s husband John a chemist.  Jo witnessed several locals finding ways to help the camp. “Bus drivers would take extra care when they saw our children crossing the streets and one day a neighbor donated money to buy popsicles for the children because it was so hot.” Gabe Yohe who led a group of six-to-eight-year-old boys recalled a favorite moment. “A boy was telling me how his sister never said she was sorry for the things she said that hurt him. I told him he could forgive her anyway. For the rest of the camp we would hear him shouting at random times ‘I forgive you!’” Evan Lent who had overall responsibility for the Action summer in Evansville said that weekly neighborhood ice cream parties the team hosted played a key role in drawing kids and allowing the team to meet their parents.   Allendale  The camp in Allendale now in its 14th year drew 111 children from the neighborhood with 60 children coming on the camp’s busiest day.  The Action team that ran the camp included Raquel Bradley a 17-year-old who grew up in the neighborhood and has been coming to camp for seven years. Another neighbor a recent high school graduate named James Porter had attended the camp as a child. He returned as a volunteer serving with one of the boys’ groups. Abcee Smith the mother of a Praise Academy student who also attended the camp volunteered in the kitchen cooking for the Action team.  Journee Elie a graduate of Trinity School at Greenlawn who went to New Orleans for college and joined the branch there came to Allendale to work with six-to-eight-year-old girls. She said that several sisters had urged her to work in Allendale telling her that as an African-American college student she could be a particularly effective role model for neighborhood girls. “God has me here and I love it” she said. John Crimmins a counselor from northern Virginia recalled how during a Bible study one of the older boys suggested that the group go to pray with and talk to their neighbors. John waited a few days to make sure the boys were serious about going. Then on the last day of camp they went out in two groups to knock on doors. “Everybody in my group led at least one conversation even those who had initially been hesitant. My team prayed with six people” John said.   Indianapolis  The five-week-long summer camp in Indianapolis drew 101 children. The boys enjoyed running timed races down Karcher Street as well as playing capture the flag kickball basketball and football. The girls wove placemats decorated journals and took a field trip to an art museum. Joe Walker a staff member from northern Virginia said his favorite moment involved a six-year-old boy. “One day after camp he proudly showed me the airplane he had made out of Popsicle sticks and clothespins. He was overjoyed.” Tim Pingel who led the camp with Ellen Putzier said that the counselors spent some time each day sharing Bible stories with the campers. “I hope that if the kids only remember one thing from camp it will be these stories” he said. High school student Genevieve Kane who worked with the youngest girls’ group recalls seeing a six-year-old girl whom she had met at camp the previous year. The girl told Genevieve that she remembered learning last year that Jesus loved her. “After that conversation I thought to myself that all we did last summer every game every conversation every hard day was worth it because that girl remembered that Jesus loves her.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5236

The event was held to meet neighbors and share music prayer and ice cream floats. Besides branch members the event attracted around 60 other adults and a dozen neighborhood kids. Tom Shriver tells us:""Even the church pastor spent the evening with us. Folks from across the street at the local deli stood for the entire evening and listened from there.

5163,July 26 2016 12:17 p.m.,"""I Not Die”: From Sudan to Oregon a Refugee Carries Her Cross",by Elizabeth Grams Photos: Rob Bolka Lisa Ficker Peter Hermes Furian Glenn Rymsza Shutterstock  Deborah Mayom a survivor of civil war in Sudan and a Trinity Academy parent with her grandson outside her home in Portland. My name Deborah. I love my name. I try to be strong lady like Deborah in Bible. I go five days no food I not die. Too many bullets coming they didn’t hit me. I drink urine I not die. I think my name is very very strong. Deborah Mayom is a mother of eight children a survivor of the long and brutal civil war in the African nation of Sudan an immigrant to the US and most importantly to her a woman of prayer. Last year through circumstances that can only be attributed to the Holy Spirit she became something else something she never expected to be growing up in a war zone—a Trinity Academy parent. Walking out of Little Caesar’s Pizza in North Portland in August 2015 she spotted a sign for Trinity Academy a school sponsored by the Vancouver-Portland branch. She went inside met Jo Clark the head of school and explained that her daughter Nyibol (NEE-ih-bull) was bright and ready for eighth grade. Deborah liked the fact that the school was Christian but she knew she didn’t have enough money to pay for tuition. Jo sensing the Spirit’s prompting told her to come back the next day with Nyibol.  Deborah returned the next day bringing Nyibol and Jo brought her daughter Addie—also 13 and ready for eighth grade. Deborah who has a large gap between her front teeth saw Addie’s braces and said “I like your smile!” Later that day Jo shared what she knew of Deborah’s story with Charlie Fraga who leads the school’s board. Though Trinity Academy had already given out all of the financial aid money in their budget for the year they agreed to admit Nyibol. A few months later a benefactor heard the story and decided to make a donation that more than paid for her tuition.  Deborah and two of her daughters: Nyibol who just completed the eighth grade at Trinity Academy and Abul who will start in sixth grade this fall. Deborah speaks five languages: Dinka Nuer Swahili Arabic and English. Her English is rudimentary but her speech has an unmistakable rhythm and her words are lyrical. Like the psalmists of old she tells of being poor threatened and on the run of facing death while surrounded by enemies on every side of deliverance at the hands of the living God. “I shall not die but live to proclaim what the Lord has done”—these ancient words are as real for her as they were for King David and his men. In telling Deborah’s story I have tried to include many of her own words. As with the Psalms they reveal her soul and the soul of her people.. . .The country of Sudan located in northeast Africa near Egypt and Ethiopia has a history not unlike that of Palestine the homeland of Deborah’s biblical namesake. After centuries of domination by one empire or another including Egypt and Great Britain Sudan achieved independence in 1956 then plunged into civil war. The war pitted the heavily Arab and Muslim northerners who dominated the government against the people of the agricultural and pastoral south where much of the country’s rich oil resources lay. In the south where Deborah grew up the population includes Christians and followers of traditional African religions.  Map: When Deborah fled Sudan she went from Duk (now part of the new country of South Sudan) to the Gambela Region of Ethiopia. Later she came to a refugee camp in Kakuma Kenya the closest thing to a home her children ever had before coming to the US. Deborah was born in 1974 to a Christian family in the village of Duk during a temporary and tenuous peace. Duk is small village. We take care of animals like cow like goat like lamb. We don’t have clothes no shoes. We don’t know what shoes mean! When I’m a child I don’t know nothing. I learn by soil. I learn by animal. I don’t learn by pen—write something down—never! I learn by hand.  I grew up going to church: my father and my mother they brought me. We pray.  In 1983 the government imposed Islamic Sharia law on the entire country including the non-Muslim south. The government ordered the transfer of southern Sudanese soldiers to the north far from their families. The soldiers rebelled and war once again swept through Sudan. In Deborah’s home area government soldiers burned down villages and dropped bombs from the air. Deborah told me that her father was killed by gunfire from a helicopter during a raid. Later when her village was attacked she became separated from her mother and the rest of her family. Muslim people shoot my church. Those people kill my dad immediately. They take our house. And then we run away. I separate from my mom. They shoot at us and then we run away. Tomorrow another place. Tomorrow another place. Walk walk walk.  Not knowing whether her mother brother and sister were still alive Deborah headed east along with many other refugees hiding alone or with small groups in the bushes to avoid getting caught by the soldiers. She trekked through river wetlands and across deserts eventually reaching Ethiopia. There she took up residence with thousands of other Sudanese in a camp with minimal shelter poor sanitation and barely enough food for survival. Cholera and other diseases were rampant.  A typical Dinka village in South Sudan similiar to the one Deborah lived in as a child. While in Ethiopia she met a soldier with the Sudan People’s Liberation Army which had formed after the imposition of Sharia in 1983 and had established training camps in Ethiopia. She married him in 1990. Deborah was 16—a normal age for a woman to marry in Sudan. A year later the Ethiopian government was taken over by a new party which was friendly to the government of Sudan. The new Ethiopian regime expelled the Sudanese refugees and soldiers from the camps. At the Gilo River while a group of refugees waited to be ferried across Ethiopian soldiers trained their fire on the crowd many of them children. Ethiopia people they shooting us. Yes they shooting us! We die. We go to river they shoot at us in the river. They shoot us they shoot us. In river there is too much water but we don’t know swim. And then people go in the water and then drown.  John Bul Dau an eyewitness said in a memoir Lost Boy Lost Girl that hundreds died while trying to cross the Gilo from bullets crocodiles or drowning. But Deborah carrying her oldest daughter had made it over on a ferry before the shooting started. She reentered Sudan where the war raged on. For many months she travelled in and out of southern Sudan moving on when fighting or air raids came close walking sometimes for months at a time in and through a broad border region that includes parts of Uganda Ethiopia and Kenya. Sometimes she ate food from trash heaps. In 1992 Deborah came to Kakuma a United Nations camp in northern Kenya which hosted tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees. Though she continued to make journeys to visit her husband who was still fighting in southern Sudan she and her growing number of children were based in Kakuma for almost 18 years. For the Mayom family and most inhabitants of the camp in the ’90s and early 2000s food clothing medical provisions and jobs were scarce. The refugees were not allowed to seek employment outside of the camp. Deborah used to bake little donuts that she would sell to other refugees using the profits to buy clothes for her children. Nyibol remembers going to school learning to read and write primarily in Swahili rather than in her native Dinka language.  Deborah and her children spent almost 18 years at Kakuma a United Nations refugee camp in Kenya. While at Kakuma one of Deborah’s children died suddenly from a mysterious illness. My son David he got fever and then after two day no energy. My son die. He’s a big boy 13 years. After that I pray. I pray God to make me come to America.  By 2005 much of the war in Sudan had ended and a peace process had begun which ultimately led to the creation of the new independent country of South Sudan. But the prospect of returning to Sudan from Kenya did not look good for Deborah and her children. There was still scattered fighting in the south primarily among tribes who had been stripped of much of the cattle and farmlands they had depended on for their livelihoods. Also Deborah’s husband had taken several other wives by this time (a common practice in South Sudan) and she says he did not provide financial support for her and her children. She petitioned the US government for asylum. While she waited her brother James came to see her. He had left Sudan at age seven one of thousands known as “lost boys” too young to fight but old enough to run. Like Deborah he had made his way to Ethiopia but had already been given asylum by the US in the early 2000s. He had been trained as an X-ray technician and in 2005 had returned to Sudan to help rebuild the south. James tracked down his sister and went to see her at Kakuma their first visit since the mid-1980s. He told her he’d been to Duk where there was nothing left. “You can’t even find the foundation of the houses. The war burnt down everything.” In 2010 after four years of waiting the US granted Deborah’s petition for asylum. She flew to a new world in Portland with her seven children. When they arrived none of them knew the language. Catholic Charities gave them a few months of financial support and an orientation. Sue Edwards a veteran volunteer with World Relief Services who befriended Deborah in Portland spoke about the challenges refugees like the Mayoms face: “They usually have a day or two to get ready then hop onto a plane. The government of their new country connects them with an organization like Catholic Charities or World Relief or Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service which takes care of them for about a week. They set them up in an apartment for three months and then they’re kind of on their own. The kids often get bullied—other kids don’t understand why they are so dark and don’t speak the language.” I got here. It’s a good place. And in the morning I’m looking at my window. I saw church. I say yes. I’m going now. My kids say you don’t know English! I say not about language. We go to pray. And then we go to church. And that pastor welcome us.  Nyibol remembers being surprised at how similar Portland seemed to Nairobi Kenya where she’d been before. “I was confused—I thought it would be different. People in Africa thought that robots do everything for you in the US. We thought we weren’t going to need our clothes because every day we’d wake up and find something new that the robots made for us.” Deborah had to learn how to lock a door drive a car use a shower and a refrigerator. Members of Glenfair Evangelical Church who had first welcomed her and where she became a member helped her with laundry and childcare in those first few months. Sue helped her learn how to drive and showed her how to cook a turkey but Deborah is still leery of the oven. Six years after coming to the US Deborah is more settled but her life is not easy. She works all afternoon and half the night in a low-paying job packaging food and cleaning at a bakery regularly sending money back to relatives in Africa including her mother whom Deborah had learned was still alive. After only a few hours’ sleep she gets her children ready and out the door for school. Before Deborah heads to work she studies and goes to a local community college to continue learning English. She spends much of her day off cooking food for the family to last the week. I’m working now. It’s a good job. Because before I pray I say God give me a good place. Because I love communicate. I love people. When some people look us maybe they say I look like someone not take shower. We strangers you know. When we come here and someone do that I’m not sad because they don’t know how to do. Right now I been for four years in that place; they know Deborah is a human being.  Nyibol has taken quickly to life at Trinity Academy. Perhaps unsurprisingly she is an especially quick study in Latin her sixth language. She played on the school’s first junior high basketball team. Pat and Jo Clark often drive her home from school since she lives near their home and Deborah works a late shift at her bakery job. Deborah often visits the school early in the day bringing huge bags of day-old bread and pastries from the bakery delivering them to students and faculty. She has registered her 11-year-old daughter Abul to enter Trinity Academy’s sixth grade in the fall of 2016.  Nyibol who first learned to read and write in Swahili enjoys learning with fellow Trinity Academy eighth graders (from left) Addie Ava and Agapena. “Nyibol is really bright and hardworking” says Jo. “Students were learning calligraphy in their art class and taking Latin at the beginning of the year. Nyibol loves both of those things. At one point she wrote a poem and she went to her Latin teacher and asked if she would help her translate it into Latin. Then she wrote it out in calligraphy and came to show me and her art teacher.” Nyibol she love Trinity. She love teachers she love students. Trinity is very very very good to Nyibol. Me too I love Trinity. They pray first and then they go to class. I love that. Dr. Clark is very very good lady. She put her life to Bible. God first and things second. Dr. Clark works for God. She don’t work for things. Dr. Clark comes to clean all the tables after the students are gone. She have a good family.  Jo Clark with Deborah. Deborah lives with five of her children in a simple Portland townhouse. (Two of the children have grown and moved out.) A clay cross decorated with beads and purple paint hangs over their door. Her neat sitting room has a display of family photos from Africa and plaques bearing Christian poems and old-fashioned pictures of Jesus. Lower on the wall hangs the handwritten poem Nyibol wrote at Trinity. Each seat on the sofas is covered with doilies Deborah embroidered with flowers. A framed photo of Deborah’s husband dressed in army fatigues stands in a prominent spot on the credenza. She talks to me about prayer: To my kid I say to pray to ask God everything. You don’t have nothing? Ask God to give to you. God there is big hand. God there is big eye. God there is big ear. Before my father and my mom told me don’t forget to pray. I didn’t forget to pray up to now. Because God hearing good. God looking good. God listening good.  At one point she pulled down the purple cross from above the doorway and held it in her hand showing how she would carry it high in front of her in Africa when she walked through the bush or when she prayed at church. Because we don’t we don’t forgot a cross. Because we die about a cross. We die forever about that cross. That song . . . It say we die about Jesus. They say you die Jesus about us. You go to cross about us.  She showed me how she kneels in front of a statue of Joseph and Mary and Jesus in the manger every day in the morning to pray. She kissed them all several times with affection and reverence. Here was another poor family who had to run for their lives into a foreign land. Here was another mother who lost a child. Here was another child in whom the parents placed their hope for a greater future. I’m poor. But I’m not thinking about it. I have food today because God change life. Right now I thank God. Because God working at night working in the morning every day. I know Jesus live with me. Lives with everybody. I go to backyard he’s there. I walking in the street he’s there.

5159,July 26 2016 12:16 p.m.,Praise Academy: A Look Back at Year One,Neighbor Paul (left) joined Tylar and Jaylen in demonstrating the catapults they made in shop class this spring under the direction of Joe Bulger.   by Sean Connolly Photos: Nano Farabough Joan Pingel School let out at Praise Academy in Shreveport on May 20. Students teachers and Mission team members celebrated the completion of their first year with hymns and brownies (prepared by the pre-K class) before capping off the day with a water balloon launch. For Joan Pingel the principal a favorite moment came when several students ran to get their final projects—ABC booklets featuring letters words and pictures—so they could show them off. The students expressed sadness at the close of the year and one told Joan he planned to wear his uniform every day during the summer. During the final month of the school year the students took a field trip to the zoo in Tyler Texas. Seven of the eight students had never been outside the city limits before and none had ever seen a zoo. Once there Joan divided them into groups and sent them off with worksheets so they could check off animals as they saw them. After spotting a red fox or a lion or a giraffe the children returned to “Miss Jones” squealing with delight. Joan wanted the students to get to see the white tiger’s graceful walk but each time they went by the tiger was asleep. Thirty minutes before they had to leave they went by one last time and they prayed that the tiger would get up and move. The tiger “lifted his head looked right at us and walked down into another part of his cage” Joan said.  Principal Joan Pingel assists Tylar (left) and Jaylen with a drawing project. Kevin McShane one of the teachers recalled the first few weeks of school when one of the youngest students would always cry or scream after being dropped off in the morning missing his mother. Others struggled to learn the daily routine a rhythmic succession of short lessons punctuated by free play exercise lunch and recess. “One student was resisting learning until Nano Farabaugh and Joan came up with a format called train station. It allowed students to move around the classroom choosing games and other educational activities at various stations.” At first one of the boys could only put together five pieces of a 25-piece puzzle during a 20-minute segment of train station. A few months later he could complete a 48-piece puzzle. Libby Grondin a Suzuki violin teacher and occasional violinist with the Shreveport symphony volunteered to teach twice-weekly music lessons. She taught students the basics on a variety of instruments: tambourines triangles drums maracas violins and xylophones and introduced classical pieces by showing performances on YouTube. “They really liked Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin” she said. Libby also took two fifth grade girls to a symphony performance for schoolchildren. “Their favorite part? Every time the orchestra played! They wanted it to go on forever” and even got annoyed when nearby students made noise during the performance.  Angel enjoys her marshmallow cookie snowman.   Pat Malone a former Greenlawn math teacher who lives next door to the school came over each day to take care of the youngest children during naptime. By the end of the year the students were saying “I love you Mr. Pat” when he left for the day. Also if a student was misbehaving Pat would sit with that student on the school’s front porch. “I used to go over every two or three days to sit with a student but by the end of the year it was once a week at most.” During these times Pat often had the students work on their counting and he saw a student who couldn’t count to 10 last September confidently count to 30. “He was very proud of it.” Colleen Bowar another teacher noted that the students’ ability to play improved as the year progressed. At the beginning during their half-hour of free play they would often fight and their play lacked imagination. “One day late in the year they created a new game loosely based on Power Rangers where they would fight the bad guys then race off to save somebody then come back and fight more bad guys. They kept the game going for several days.” Joe Bulger ran a shop class for the boys two times each week. They made coat racks for the school and a stand for a bike that they can now pedal on the back porch. The shop class also designed built and raced Pinewood Derby cars. “The boys were proud of their cars and it was fun for them to create their own unique designs.” Jeanette Duddy who volunteered at the school each morning appreciated small moments of success: “The kids did one project that involved picking up beans with tweezers. It was a difficult task and they grew frustrated and were tempted to cheat. But they persisted and were finally able to do it after a few days of effort. They learned to keep at it.”  Latisha (left) and Shakiya dressed up and prepared food appropriate for the Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations they studied in history class this year. Joan noted that the many gifts the school received from all over the community gave her a chance to teach geography. A youth group from Oahu sent books they bought with money raised from a garage sale. Youth groups in northern Virginia and Colorado Springs sent notebooks paper pencils letters and more books. Servant Branch members hosted a shower for the school and others sent money around Christmastime that Joan used to buy a Nativity set. She also received text messages from all over the community offering prayers encouragement and words from the Lord. “When you’re in the trenches sometimes you can feel like it’s just you there on your own but I didn’t feel that way. We had our needs met pretty quickly by the body of Christ.” Nano Farabaugh the president of Praise Academy made four visits to the school and spoke about the spirit of this year’s efforts. “Paul DeCelles told us from the beginning that we should not be trying to teach in a programmatic way like many schools do. Our goal is to teach to the children tailoring everything to their specific needs. That’s why we have a high ratio of teachers to students which we intend to maintain as the school grows. We’re dealing with an extreme situation in the neighborhood and we are very glad to be able to help our neighbors meet their needs for education.” “In the next few months Praise Academy expects to receive recognition of its status as a nonprofit corporation in the state of Louisiana” added Paul DeCelles the chairman of the school’s board.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5159
5154,July 26 2016 12:16 p.m.,Community Members Spread Marriage in Christ,Phil and Suzanne Rooke (standing) hosted the Saskatoon branch’s second Marriage in Christ seminar last April. Among the participants were branch members Morris and Janice Akerman (left) and Rick and Maria Strobl. by Elizabeth Pease Photo: Suzanne Rooke Five a.m. The alarm sounds and 20-somethings Andrew and Emily Hayden shuffle downstairs in their suburban Burnsville MN home. With their one-year-old son asleep upstairs they sit on wooden barstools at the kitchen counter and pray together following a format in their Marriage in Christ manual. “We tried to pray together when we were dating” Andrew said. “It felt awkward sometimes and we just couldn’t get it to work. The Marriage in Christ seminar gave us a rubric to follow.” “For me” said Emily “Marriage in Christ called out all of the lies that society is trying to tell you about marriage. Yeah these are struggles you’re going to go through. No they’re not reasons to be apart from your spouse. The Holy Spirit can help you get through these struggles and connect on a deeper level.” Andrew and Emily’s story is one of the hundreds that could be told about the impact of Marriage in Christ (MIC). As of May 2016 more than 800 couples had completed the five-week program of video talks discussions and prayer. Bill Wacker Joel Kibler and other Servant Branch members launched the program in 2011 and the board of governors adopted it as a work of the People of Praise in 2013. “Because of the Holy Spirit we have so many strong marriages in the community. Marriage in Christ is a way that we can bear witness and share with the church and the world what God has given us” Joel said. Bill sees a wide context for the effort. “I think one thing God wants to do in this day and age is to make Christian marriage appear more beautiful and attractive to the broader culture and we’re playing a part in that.” Since 2011 community host couples have put on 65 seminars in 16 branches and have helped bring the seminar to 23 US states Canada and the Caribbean. In Shreveport Bill and Mary Frances Parker’s pastor said he would allow the seminar at their parish if the local bishop approved it. The Parkers invited the bishop to dinner and showed him one of the videos. “He loved it” Mary Frances said and since then the Parkers Jack and Teresa Lynch and Mark and Natalia Bendele have put on four seminars. Gerry and Cathy Orthmann (Yakima) have focused on follow-up inviting the participants from the seminar they hosted to come back to their home. Couples came with their families for ice cream; the adults came for a nice dinner followed by men’s and women’s discussion groups; and the women came over for breakfast. The women are particularly hungry for fellowship Cathy said. Kevin and Anna-Lisa Rodriguez (Kingston) have worked for other marriage preparation and improvement programs but found something new and helpful in Marriage in Christ. “This is what every married person needs because it focuses on the fundamentals of life in Christ irrespective of how long we’ve been married or how much we believe we’ve got it right” Kevin said. In the Twin Cities Servant Branch members have hosted 26 seminars. In South Bend Dan and Anne Brewer and Jim and Gerry Sgroi ran a seminar for 35 couples the branch’s largest so far. Rick and Diane Ridenour and Dave and Maggie Temeles have put on four seminars in northern Virginia. After three seminars in Corvallis Terry Aman credits the MIC staff for making the seminar very easy to pull off: “The kit Sally and I received was very well-organized and included a checklist for what had to be done when.” In the Marriage in Christ office Bill Wacker and Lucy Cunningham are developing a new kit to make it easier for branch couples to promote the seminar in their churches and cities. Fundraising is also a priority. An anonymous couple has offered to match all gifts made to MIC before July 30 2016 up to $25000. Bob Brickweg (Servant Branch) who serves with Joel and Bill on the MIC board said “I am so thankful for the brothers and sisters who have worked to make Marriage in Christ succeed in their branches. Like anything of value it takes effort but the Lord returns so much more.” Part of that return comes when couples like Andrew and Emily Hayden are trained as host couples and begin to put on seminars. They recently hosted one for eight couples in their home. “The seminar isn’t a magic wand” Emily said but it has helped the Haydens establish habits of prayer conversation and love. It’s a slow work that starts each day at 5:00 and that they are now passing on to others. With couples helping other couples the effort will bear fruit over the long term one prayer time one act of forgiveness and one seminar at a time.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5154

Photo by Carrie Gonzalez.  Dr. Kay Yohe (northern Virginia) a gifted teacher administrator writer speaker and scholar of church history is the new head of Trinity School at Meadow View in Falls Church VA. Former head Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) is leaving the school after 17 years to launch Cana Academy a nonprofit organization that will bring the benefits of classical education to the poor the elderly and prisoners.  For many years Dr. Yohe has taught Scripture and Catholic doctrine at the Meadow View campus and served as director of admissions. She earned her Ph.D. in historical theology from Catholic University of America in 1992 writing a dissertation about the 12th-century British monk Aelred of Rievaulx. She holds both a master’s degree in systematic theology and a bachelor’s degree in social work from Notre Dame. Dr. Yohe taught at LaSalle University in Philadelphia and Catholic University of America before coming to the Meadow View campus. She has published ten scholarly articles in academic journals several book chapters and numerous pieces in New Heaven/New Earth and Vine & Branches two magazines published by the People of Praise.  Dr. Yohe has a lifelong passion for learning. “Between being a student and holding a wide variety of teaching jobs I haven’t completely left school since I started as a kindergartner 52 years ago” she says.  “Kay has been a staunch supporter of the Trinity vision of education from the beginning” said Dr. Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools. “In addition to being a master teacher for Scripture and doctrine she has a wonderful gift of working with our students—each of whom she knows from her service as director of admissions. I am looking forward to the impact of her scholarship vision and leadership on Trinity School at Meadow View.” Andrew added “Dr. Yohe has been a font of intelligence and kindness. In her capacity as director of admissions she has been an early and highly effective contact for every family. As the leader of our Scripture and doctrine curricula she has been central to the ecumenical development of our school.” Dr. Yohe grew up in Bay Village OH a western suburb of Cleveland. (She notes that she will be cheering for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA finals.) Her husband Mike is the principal at Falls Church High School part of the Fairfax County Public Schools District. Their son Gabe 20 a student at the University of Virginia is a 2013 graduate of Meadow View. All three are members of the northern Virginia branch.

5134,May 31 2016 9:11 p.m.,Whit Au Receives National Award,"Congratulations to Whit Au (Oahu) who on May 25 was presented with the Gold Medal of the Acoustical Society of America for contributions to understanding underwater biosonar and for service to the Acoustical Society. To celebrate we've posted here our article on Whit and his work from the April 2008 issue of V&B. Enjoy! Whit Au: Making Sense Out of Dolphin Sounds by Sharon Gouveia and Sean Connolly Most weekday mornings Whit Au (Oahu) waits on a pier for his ride to work a Boston Whaler that carries him across crystalline blue waters toward a tiny Hawaiian island surrounded by lagoons. His office is on 29-acre Coconut Island the same puff of land pictured in the final shot of the introduction to the 1960s TV show Gilligan’s Island and now home to the world-class research labs and floating captive-animal pens of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. Whit chief scientist of the University of Hawaii’s Marine Mammal Research Program studies killer whales humpback whales shrimp and especially dolphins. Unlike most of his colleagues and graduate students he isn’t a zoologist or a biologist. He’s a self-described “non-huggy” scientist who doesn’t swim with or pet his research subjects. (“There are trainers for that” he points out.) Whit is an electrical engineer by training one of the first to enter this field and he’s an expert on dolphin sonar or echolocation. Dolphins are known for their keen intelligence (though there is no way to prove the common notion that they are among the most intelligent of animals Whit says) and for their remarkable communications capabilities. They make two noises primarily: several-secondlong whistles (audible to the human ear) and millisecond high-frequency clicks (inaudible to humans). Scientists believe dolphins use whistles to communicate with one another and bottlenose dolphins even have unique signature whistles that act like names—they’re used for calling other dolphins and for identifying themselves.  Whit’s research has focused on the high-frequency clicks. In the 1950s scientists first began to suspect that dolphins used these clicks for echolocation. Just as bats use sound waves to navigate in the dark dolphins send sound waves through dark and cluttered ocean waters bouncing them off objects and then using the echoes to glean information about the distance and nature of the items in their environment. “Amazingly they can tell the difference between identical-looking small aluminum and steel spheres at 50 meters or better. Spotting a 30-centimeter cod from 100 meters away is no challenge. A human swimmer being that much larger is probably visible to them beyond 200 meters” Whit told Wired magazine. “They have the best sonar on this planet” he said in another interview with National Geographic. They eclipse all instances of man-made technological sonar. The US Navy knows this and has trained teams of dolphins to act as underwater intelligence gatherers. In 2003 the Navy dispatched a dolphin team into the Persian Gulf to detect underwater mines and then deposit detonation packages by the mines. (The packages are not detonated until the dolphins have returned safely.) “Dolphins can not only find objects like mines buried in the seabed but they can distinguish them from clutter such as coral rock and manmade debris” he says. For many years Whit designed experiments with captive dolphins. For example he would place suction cups over dolphins’ eyes and then dangle balls in front of them at varying distances to test and measure the strength and accuracy of their sonar. The results of his experiments are summarized in his book The Sonar of Dolphins published in 1993 the first modern study of the subject. Whit’s longterm goal is to learn enough about dolphin sonar to help scientists design better technological sonar. “Research is so much fun” he says “discovering new things never known or documented before writing papers. I tell my students if you’re not having fun forget it you’re in the wrong field.”  Whit (in red) with his son Wes Wes’s wife Johanna their son Mark and B.J. (in water). Whit never expected to work with dolphins. In the early 1970s he and his wife Dorothy came to Hawaii for two months after Whit had finished his Ph.D. Toward the end of that visit they felt a sudden and overwhelming urge to stay a desire both later concluded had come from the Lord. Although Whit had a research job in his field (electromagnetism) lined up in San Diego he decided to widen his job search and look around for any kind of research. Then he encountered a man nicknamed Crazy Evans who worked in an artillery bunker on the Marine Corps base on Oahu. He was busy starting an underwater environmental research team and through him the door into the world of dolphin sonar opened. It was also around this time that Whit and Dorothy became involved with charismatic renewal and then in the late 1970s with the People of Praise. In the late ’90s the Navy lab Whit had worked at for over two decades closed and he faced a crucial decision in his career. He could either transfer to the main laboratory in San Diego or move from the federal government to the state taking a job at a University of Hawaii research facility. Again the Lord moved him to stay and Whit has been working with the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology since 1997. His research there has broadened to include other marine animals and their interaction with their environments. He throws out some questions: Did oceanic dolphins become coastal or did coastal dolphins eventually become oceanic? What other kinds of long-term relationships do humpback whales maintain in addition to “mother and calf”? A recent experiment uncovered an answer to one question: How do spinner dolphins forage for food in the dark ocean water? Whit and his graduate students used five echosounders to track dolphins and their prey during their nightly feeding period. The complexity of what they discovered surprised them. Spinner dolphins hunt in groups of 14-26 first forming a circle to surround their prey (fish shrimp and squid) then morphing themselves into a fast-moving three-dimensional cylinder that packs their prey in even tighter. The dolphins use whistles to communicate with one another and maintain the integrity of their enclosure. Then they take turns feeding entering the enclosure in pairs. Whit’s own fieldwork and consulting work for other researchers takes him all over the globe: Iceland Canada Bahamas New Zealand Alaska Netherlands etc. and students from all over the world clamor to come to Hawaii to study under him. He repeats how blessed he is how the Lord put him in the right place at the right time. “It’s an interesting life. The more you study certain animals the more you appreciate what humans are—we are ‘fearfully and wonderfully made’” (Ps. 139:14). Whit feels his life as a scientist resonates with what the Lord said to Adam: Take dominion over the earth. “A scientist seeks truth in a particular field” he says. “This is one way of taking dominion over the earth.” It’s a life calling. Or as Dorothy translates: “He is never retiring.” ""Nope"" he grins broadly: ""this is way too much fun!""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5134
5067,May 18 2016 11:30 p.m.,Evansville: Springtime Brings Plants and Projects,This spring the mission team in Evansville got to work on four projects: building two new modular homes running a camp for children organizing a food club for neighborhood women and cultivating an urban farm. Like the cucumbers and purple bush beans that are pushing their way through the soil at the farm these projects are in the sprouting stage with much growth and fruit still to come as summer sets in. The projects are also bringing new people into the mix. Peter Putzier has moved from Servant Branch to take charge of the farm. Later in the summer Orest and Susan Holovaty plan to move from South Bend to join the mission team and about 20 more brothers and sisters will arrive in June to help with the camp returning to their home locations at summer’s end.   Urban Farm  This is the second year for the urban farm. Last summer the farm yielded 700 pounds of produce which the households divided according to the shares each had purchased at the beginning of the season. Some weeks the farm provided nearly all the produce for the missionaries and they needed to buy little else. The planting for this year’s farm took place on April 16 a warm and sunny afternoon and drew together missionaries and two families who are underway in the community as well as several neighbors. The women and girls planted hundreds of seeds in a set of 22 raised beds: corn peas squash even a box with flowers for cutting. The men and boys brought more soil over to the beds from another empty lot. Peter says the plan this year is to allocate 70 percent of the produce for community members. Another 10 percent will be given away to those who need it and 10 percent will be sold at a farm stand or the local farmers’ market. The final 10 percent will go toward compensating neighbors who help on the farm. Next spring they plan on expanding the farm substantially. They hope to provide most if not all of the produce for the households to be able to sell a substantial amount to be able to teach neighborhood children about the world and how to work to produce food that can be used in the developing food club (see below) and perhaps even to be able to provide a source of employment for their neighbors.  Caleb Grace and Levi Sullivan inspect the portable greenhouse built by John Broxup Peter Hammer and Jacob Hammer from the Buffalo branch.   Food Club  Chris Vieck has led a neighborhood women’s group in Evansville for almost six years. The women gather every week to put their lives in common support one another and share life in Christ. Some of the members of the group are members of the People of Praise some are not. A few months ago a member of the group shared about a problem she was having. She needed a way to make her $176 food stamp allotment last the entire month for herself and her teenage child. She was also overweight diabetic and having heart problems so she needed to eat both affordably and nutritiously. The women’s group took this on as a challenge. They researched planned and compared prices at several stores. Together they came up with a plan for the month and a couple of them took her shopping each week. She ended the month on budget. These events helped crystallize a vision for the food club—a place where women can come together to learn to plan menus to shop to organize their kitchens and to cook tasty and nutritious meals for their families–all on a budget. The club is starting small with one group of seven women who are learning more about meal planning and shopping in hopes that they can share what they learn with other neighborhood women. “Practically all the women in the neighborhood have kids in the house and are responsible for making a home” Chris Vieck says. Her hope is that they will be able to start more clubs and that taken together the clubs will serve as a network that connects neighborhood women and allow them to share more of their lives.   New Homes  Last year Paul Hommes a mechanical engineer by training formed a new company Linwood Construction. Paul and his employees have renovated a house on the missionary’s target block and they have taken responsibility for managing most of the property owned by the community and its members in Evansville currently eight houses and six empty lots. This year Paul and his business manager John Earhart (also a mechanical engineer) have formed a partnership with Heckaman Homes of Nappanee Indiana. Their goal is to place two new modular homes on the target block. One will be for Orest and Susan; the missionary sisters’ household will live in the second. Modular homes are built in a factory to specifications set by the customer. Paul notes that they’re not trailers or manufactured housing. In fact they can be hard to distinguish from traditionally built homes once they are finished. They are normally built with 2x10 floor joists and 2x6 framing in the exterior walls making them stronger than many traditionally built homes. (They need this extra strength so they can withstand the trip from the factory to the construction site.) Paul explains “Because a modular home can be built inside on an assembly line with a consistent workforce the costs are much lower and the home can be completed in as little as half the time it takes to build a traditional home.” Paul spent the month of April communicating with Orest several times each day by phone and email while also conferring with his contact at Heckaman in an effort to settle the home’s design and budget. Eventually Linwood Construction will procure the necessary permits and the houses will be constructed in a factory in Nappanee before being shipped in several pieces down to Evansville.  John Earhart (right) is the business manager for Linwood Construction a company founded by Paul Hommes (left) to provide property-related services for the People of Praise outreach in Evansville.   Summer Camp  From the first moment they moved into the neighborhood the missionaries have been interacting with local children; singing with them teaching Bible stories and skits organizing games and crafts. This summer they will run their first camp which Evan Lent and Mary Timler are planning. The camp will run from June 20 to July 8 and will be staffed by missionaries high school and college students and others sent by the Action program office. Jo Zimmel (Servant Branch) who helped establish the camps in Allendale and Indianapolis will be on hand to lead the charge. The camp will be held on empty lots and at a local public park. Evan says the goals for the camp are to have fun to learn about the Lord and to work on good relationships. He hopes that by the end of the summer they will have a foundation for relating with the kids that could eventually turn into something more. Just as in Allendale he hopes this camp could one day feed into a Praise Academy.   * * * Nick Holovaty who leads the mission team says all four of these projects have been shaped by a consultation process that lasted more than a year. It involved knocking on 400 doors and collecting input from neighbors about the needs of the neighborhood and what they wanted to see happen. They noticed themes. There was a need in the neighborhood for dignifying work especially for the men. There was interest among the women in learning more about meal planning and nutrition and about how to address nutrition-related health concerns including child obesity. There was a desire to clean up the neighborhood and make it look better. There was also a concern repeated again and again for the children in the neighborhood for their safety for their need for purposeful activity and for them to learn more about the Lord. The mission team collated the input brainstormed practical actions they could take and then ranked their ideas by importance and feasibility before settling on these four. In addition to taking on these projects Nick says they continue to send out teams daily to knock on doors and share the gospel the same way the missionaries have done since they arrived in the city in 2010. “We have been trusting in the Lord to lead us through this process” he says. “Now we are counting on him to water these seeds and give the growth.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5067
5070,May 18 2016 11:28 p.m.,Servant Camp: Fundraising at the Finish Line,"Servant Branch members have found a fun way to raise funds for Servant Camp. About 6:00 in the morning on a Saturday a group of 20 or so brothers and sisters will go to the site of a local race like the Monster Dash 5K an event that attracts 10000 runners. The race is organized by Team Ortho a nonprofit organization that organizes races and staffs them using preexisting groups of people typically groups of volunteers associated with local nonprofit organizations. The People of Praise volunteers will spend the morning checking in gear for runners or passing out water and Team Ortho will donate $500 for their efforts. The money goes to the branch camp fund where it is used to cover the fees for kids who could not otherwise afford to go to camp. The races are festive events and the volunteers often find themselves greeting costumed runners. Kathy Stauble says “That’s easy conversation to say ‘Oh you’re a great banana! Have fun running in that thing!’” Since last year’s camp Servant Branch members have worked three races and earned enough money to take care of all the estimated needs for the 2016 camp. The idea began three years ago when Pat Ficker director of Servant Camp started looking for a fundraiser to fill a need. A number of grandparents in the People of Praise had asked about financial help for their grandchildren to go to camp. “I started telling our team of directors ‘I wonder if we could find a way to support these other campers.’” Jeanne Oberg had worked with Team Ortho and it gave her an idea. “I thought What the heck? They’re always looking for extra groups.” One People of Praise grandmother rejoices in the impact the camperships have had on her granddaughters. Two of them have been baptized in the Holy Spirit at camp and they keep in touch with the friends they’ve made there. She says “They don’t go to church. This is the only exposure they have to the love of the Lord or a solid Christian environment. I love them but I’m just grandma. To me it’s evident that they’ve had a profound experience because they want to go back every year.” Making that experience possible motivates the branch members who volunteer. Says volunteer Phil Gaffney “I was baptized in the Holy Spirit at Servant Camp. Even though I haven’t been able to go in recent years Servant Camp means a lot to me. To give kids an opportunity to go when they might not normally be able to–I see a lot of value in that.” Team Ortho has asked if People of Praise teams would be available to run the gear check at five more races this year. At the Get Lucky race Kathy talked with the organizer in charge of all the volunteers. The organizer said “You guys are on time and you work hard.” “She was really appreciative” adds Kathy. The chance to spend four or five hours working together is a highlight for branch members. Says Marya Waletzko “I am relatively new to the community. I came in not knowing anyone really. At the last race I was talking to Paul Hrbacek. He told me all about his experience taking his dad to Washington DC to see the war memorials. Every time I volunteer at a race I hear a similar story. I connect with someone I wouldn’t have otherwise known and then I know another smiling face at community meetings.” It takes a lot of volunteers to support a larger race and Team Ortho recruits all sorts of different groups to help. Phil spent some time working next to members of a fraternity and he noticed branch volunteers talking to them about camp. “If you work with a new group of volunteers a frequent topic is why you are helping with the race. So there’s an opportunity for us to share about the People of Praise and about Servant Camp. Everybody is really willing to share.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5070

5056,April 27 2016 1:19 p.m.,Why Community? Kelly's Story,Kelly McMullen (Colorado Springs) shares her People of Praise story. For more testimonies see the Fall 2015 issue of V&B.   Fifteen years ago I traveled to Houston for a meeting. On Sunday morning I went to Mass at a church I had attended when I lived in Texas. I loved that church because the music was so lively there. At one point the congregation was blessing the people who were preparing to join the church extending their hands in prayer. For me this was an awkward gesture one that Catholics rarely used. But there I was standing against the back wall with my hands up blessing the candidates.  Just the week before it had become clear that my husband of 14 years and I were going to get a divorce. And my daughter Jayme was in the process of being diagnosed as autistic. And we had just moved to Colorado Springs and I needed a job. So . . . divorce autism bar exam find a house—all this stuff!  I just prayed Lord if some of this blessing could be for me too I just really need it right now. I was kneeling there on the floor and I felt Jesus’ arms around me like he’d knelt down behind me and cradled me. It was a physical sensation a most personal experience. I couldn’t stop crying. In the back of that church the Holy Spirit saved me and never left. *** I was born in the San Francisco Bay area but my parents were farm people from Iowa. Gradually they decided that working in the electronics industry in California wasn’t what they wanted to do—they wanted to get out of that crazy worldly place. My dad found work in a small rural town in Nevada. My family went to church every Sunday but that was all. We had no prayer at home. Off I went to college and into life. I got engaged and a few weeks before the wedding my fiancé told me he had decided to become an atheist. (I thought I was marrying a Baptist whose grandfather was a preacher.) I thought it was too late to back out so I got married.  During my marriage I think I only went to church at Christmas and Easter until June 1995 when my daughter was born. But once Jayme arrived I could not entertain the notion of raising her outside of the church. Since her birth I have only missed Mass three times including one time after a car accident.  *** After our move to Colorado Springs and then my experience of the Holy Spirit in Houston I managed to find a job at a law firm. It was the same firm where Pat Hrbacek came to work two months later. At the office I noticed that Pat did this unheard-of thing for a young lawyer—he left at 4:45 every afternoon. That was bizarre behavior. Was he working at home?  Pat walked past my door every day to get to the elevator and he developed this habit of sticking his head in and asking if there was anything I wanted him to pray for. A few times he even came in and prayed with me. I told Pat that I was going through a divorce. He put me in touch with Mark Elio who was doing a family ministry. Mark invited me to my first public meeting. So I went and then I went the next month and the next month and the next. I didn’t go to their picnic because I was too shy but I went to the meeting after that. Then Pat said he and Kara were going back to Minnesota for Thanksgiving and asked what I was doing. I said I figured I’d be on my own and he told me he wasn’t comfortable with that. I thought What? Whose business is it of yours? I’m fine with being alone why aren’t you fine?  “I know some people and I’ll see if they can ask you over” he said. He gave me this address 99 Raven Hills and I showed up at Louie and Nancy Grams’s house because Pat was “not comfortable” with me sitting around watching TV on Thanksgiving! And of course Louie did what he does. He told me the story of the People of Praise and all the things the community has done and about what it is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and about the Sisterhood and Grenada and all the charismatic conferences. I’m a history person so I loved all this. (By the way that was a Thanksgiving that tasted right. I’m Iowa people at my roots so there’s a certain way food should taste.)  Anyhow I was there all day and finally it was night. Louie said “So you’ve come to a lot of our public meetings. What do you think?” “It’s good it’s cool. I appreciate getting prayed with.” “When are you going to make it official and join us so you can come every week instead of just once a month?”  I took a deep breath and asked “Am I invited?”  “Of course you’re invited.”  I don’t go where I’m not invited so I started thinking about it. Then Pat and I were laid off together from the firm and I was getting ready to move. In the confusion the process of joining the community took a couple more months. Then in April 2002 a group of women showed up at my apartment to clean it and pack my stuff and the following weekend I met with my new head Patti Deakin.  *** When you come underway you learn a lot. For someone like me not growing up in community I had to learn all the context. There was one moment in 2006 that made things a lot clearer for me. I was planning to take my daughter to Disney World because she was 11 and old enough to handle walking through Disney and she still loved princesses. I was at a wedding reception telling John Brophy I was looking up hotels because I was about to take my daughter to Disney. He said “Hotels?” I said “Yeah that’s what you do.” But in 15 minutes he had gotten on his cell phone and reported to me that I was going to stay at Pat Benito’s house (Tampa). He set it all up. So we went and spent a few days at Pat’s home on the coast with a swimming pool which I loved. That was the first time that I didn’t just do my own thing.  That trip started a tradition—every year I travel to somewhere in the People of Praise. In 2008 my big trip was to Allendale. Gerry and Patti Deakin had moved there in February. I needed to go to Texas in March and Allendale was just a couple of hours away so I drove there and visited Patti. (Patti by the way a Protestant walked me through getting an annulment of my marriage in the Catholic Church soon after I joined the community. She taught me ecumenism because she lived it with me.) She was already in a walking group with ladies in the neighborhood along with fellow mission team members Laura Brummer and Jeanette Zimmel (now Duddy). The Seitzes were living there too. So I got involved in their life. I went on a shopping trip for the household and did the walk with the neighborhood women and got myself right into a fast day and meditations with them. On that trip I started to get more of a grip on this community thing—we do real things like fasting and meditations and living in common and living simply. I came home and incorporated some of that in my life. I started fasting on Fridays just to be in unity with them even though we’re a thousand miles apart. I worked with Action from about 2007 to about 2014. Now I’m working with the middle school girls here (they call themselves Sparks of the Fire.) I think I’ve made four official Action trips plus my visits to the Deakins in Allendale and my visit to Evansville. My daughter Jayme has practically grown up in the community—she started attending public meetings when she was six. When Jayme was in the eighth grade I moved her into an online school so I became her primary teacher. Online learning is something that works for her. Because of her autistic behaviors and stilted speech I think school is perhaps more difficult for her in person than online. She’s going to college now enrolled in a community college program. She’s learning and growing. Vocational certification in library technology is what she’s working toward. She loves when she gets to do real jobs at the library so my role is to help line up job applications and job support resources. This young adult who is not supposed to understand anything abstract has an absolute belief that God is with us and it’s worth praying for people and over people. People at one of our meetings prayed with Jayme after a knee operation. One of them Kara Hrbacek had a sprained wrist and Jayme turned around and prayed with Kara. That was more important to her than receiving prayer herself.  I just celebrated my tenth anniversary of being covenanted. Every year about a month before celebration week I pull out the Spirit and Purpose and pray through it in a personal way asking Lord what more is there that you want me to understand about this life I’m promised to. What new deeper thing do you want me to know or do? I really seek the Lord’s word and exhortation about it. This year I spent time reading through my own words—what I’d written about the covenant in years past. I’m in such a different place now. I’ve learned new ways to pray. I’ve experienced friendship with Jesus and fellowship with people. I’ve learned a lot about service and my life is so much richer because of it. As I do each year I rededicated myself to living out our covenant ever more deeply. *** One day my daughter Jayme was looking at an icon of the Holy Family. I asked her “How do you feel about that?” Her reply: “Mom the Holy Family is for everyone even single people.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5056
5023,April 13 2016 11:55 a.m.,In Corvallis Meltons get word for Clint at McDonalds,Jessica Melton (Corvallis) wanted her children to experience the power of God and grow in faith so she adopted a strategy she had only heard about but never tried. She and her husband Tom gathered their four children together and had them ask God to reveal to them some details about someone God might want them to speak to. They each prayed and wrote down what they received. “McDonald's” was written down twice as was “glasses.” One person had written “older man.” Two people independently came up with the name “Clint.” The family piled in the car and drove to McDonald's where they found an older gentleman with glasses who said his name was Clint. Tom told him that God had him on his mind that day and Clint thanked him warmly. “It was a faith-builder for us all” said Jessica.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5023

5030,April 12 2016 9:47 a.m.,Because You're my Brother,"Nick Holovaty (Evansville missionaries) shared this story at the Leaders' Conference for Women a few weeks ago: A few weeks ago I went to visit Jason in the county jail. We’ve known Jason and his family for about four years. When he came into the visitation room at the jail he could hardly look at me. Jason has scars on his face—he looks like a pretty tough guy but when he saw me he began crying. He was ashamed. “I’m just worthless!” he said after a while. “I don’t know why I got locked up this time. I didn’t do anything. But I know I deserve it for what I’ve done before. It’s all on me. I’m just worthless.” After a pause he said “Why would you come to see me? I don’t know why anyone would come to see me! Why would you come to see me?” “Because you’re my brother!” I blurted out. Then something kind of clicked for him. He said “You know God is using me in here!” He told me his cellmate had changed since he showed up. Instead of being angry at everybody he was starting to admit his situation was his own fault—“Like me” Jason said. The men in their jail pod had even started praying together every night. “And you know Nick with all I’m going through...” (I thought of his struggles with alcohol his run ins with the police getting fired from work getting beat up getting locked up being homeless getting his kids taken away from him…) He continued “This is gonna sound strange but I think of Jesus and everything they put him through and it was for our sake! It was for us! For our sins! And I feel like I’m going through it for everybody else too! I’m like Jesus! The only difference is I deserve it!” It was my turn to cry. Jason and I held our hands up to the plexiglass between us and prayed for each other. I started he finished. “Love you bro!” Jason said. “Love you too!""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5030

4972,Feb. 4 2016 3:08 p.m.,In Muncie Christians Pray “Father Make Us One.”,More than 50 people from at least eight Muncie churches gathered on a snowy afternoon in January to pray for Christian unity. They came from African American congregations from Methodist and nondenominational churches and from Muncie’s Roman Catholic parishes. Deliverance Temple hosted the service the first of its kind in Muncie since 2009. According to Deacon Jim Rush an ecumenical officer for the local Catholic diocese the service would not have happened this year without Jim Schenkel and the support of the Muncie branch of the People of Praise. Mr. Rush began looking for someone to organize the service in early 2015. After the third person told him to talk with Jim Schenkel Mr. Rush got in touch with him and Jim ultimately agreed to spearhead the service. He sent flyers to every church in the city (roughly 130 churches) took out newspaper ads and ads in church bulletins. He even spoke before the city council about the event. A turning point came when Jim met Rev. Andre Mitchell of Deliverance Temple at a pastors’ meeting and Rev. Mitchell asked Jim why he had come. “I believe that God sent me here” Jim replied. Rev. Mitchell took Jim seriously and ultimately agreed to host the service at Deliverance Temple. “We shared a brotherly bond from the start” Rev. Mitchell said. Ten pastors and Christian leaders agreed to participate and stood together at the front of the church. Jim as emcee called on Bill Bolka (Muncie) to lead the group in “Amazing Grace” with his guitar. Men and women from different churches read Scripture passages. Then Peter Walters (Muncie) gave a talk on John 17. He said that Jesus’ heartfelt words on unity spoken on the night before he died showed how important the unity of Christians is to God. In keeping with that theme the service ended with the song “Father Make Us One.” Those words resonated with Rev. Andre Mitchell and his father Rev. Royce Mitchell who founded Deliverance Temple. “John 17 was my father’s theme passage for 25 years” Rev. Andre Mitchell explained. Later Rev. Andre Mitchell took Pete over to a mural painted on the wall. It showed a Bible open to the words of Jesus’ prayer in John 17 with the words “Lord Make Us One.” “I've always had an interest in promoting Christian unity but I’ve never been to a gathering like this” Rev. Royce Mitchell said. “This was the largest number of Catholics we've had in the church at one time.” Following the service Muncie branch members served a simple lunch and many of the people stayed to eat and talk together. The event surpassed Mr. Rush’s expectations. “It was a huge success. It gives us much to build on. It was wonderful to have an ecumenical group like the People of Praise support it.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4972
4949,Jan. 25 2016 4:56 p.m.,In NOVA Three Feet of Snow and Lots of Shoveling,Story by Elizabeth Grams and Chris Meehan. Photos courtesy of Elizabeth Adams Frank Bassett Maria Elliott and Bill Sjoberg. After the massive snowstorm dubbed “Snowzilla” hit the east coast of the United States this weekend brothers and sisters in the northern Virginia branch are still standing . . . in up to three feet of snow.  “So far everyone seems to be okay” says Principal Branch Coordinator Bob Magill. “We’re ready to look out for each other. It’ll take us a couple days to dig out.” The storm also brought heavy winds thunder and lightning to the D.C. area on Friday and Saturday leaving many people looking at two or more feet of snow outside their windows by Sunday morning. While children got busy building snow forts and sledding men in the branch took on driveways and sidewalks with their shovels and the occasional snowblower even as another round of snow fell Sunday afternoon.    In the branch’s south area coordinator Rick Ridenour enlisted men’s groups to look after the needs of those less able. John Elliott Dave Baldwin and Lee Smith worked from about 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday removing snow for single women and elderly members of the area as well as for other neighbors. As they travelled from neighborhood to neighborhood with John’s snowblower and some shovels more men from the area joined them in each spot. “First they had to clear part of the street just to get to my house” said Barbara Moore a branch member who lives alone. “The men labored so hard and so long yesterday. I’m grateful to them and to the People of Praise.”    Bill Sjoberg a meteorologist who works for a government weather agency started a branch email chain that well snowballed over the course of the weekend. He told everyone the proper way to measure the snow in their yards and reports came in steadily from different parts of the branch. While power outages and flooding have affected other parts of the East coast and at least 21 deaths associated with the storm have been reported life in the D.C. area has simply come to a halt. Branch offices and Trinity School at Meadow View along with public schools and government offices will remain closed at least through Tuesday. Flooding and water damage are a risk for the area when the snow melts.    For the moment branch members are taking the snow day to spend time with one another in their homes gathering for meals and games and traveling mostly by foot. “It’s been a time for family and fellowship” says Bill.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4949
4891,Oct. 16 2015 2:33 p.m.,A New Principal Branch Coordinator for Oahu,"Photo above courtesy of Ron Gouveia. Other photos by Fran Macalintal. Craig Lent has appointed Ron Gouveia as the new principal branch coordinator for the Oahu branch. Ron began a six-year term on October 15 2015. He follows Tom Duddy who served three consecutive six-year terms. Ron 67 is a tenured coordinator and one of the men who led the Light of Christ prayer group whose members became the Oahu branch of the People of Praise in 1983. A lifelong Oahu resident Ron has one daughter Sharon and a son Jonathan from his 36-year marriage to his wife Carrie who died in 2006. He works as a certified public accountant and plans to retire in 2017. “I’m grateful for Ron’s willingness to accept the responsibility for leading the branch” Craig said. “Ron has been a faithful leader in Oahu for many years and has the trust and affection of his brothers and sisters in Christ.” Ron and Tom in addition to being neighbors within the same condominium are long-time brothers in the community. The Duddys came to Oahu in 1980 on a Navy commission and had their first ever Lord’s Day dinner with Ron and Carrie Gouveia’s household. On October 4 the Oahu branch devoted their annual community celebration meeting to honoring and thanking Tom and his wife Mary for their years of service.    “Tom served unselfishly humbly generously with a great passion to be the servant of all” Donald Busekrus said. Branch members recalled his accordion-playing skills his passion for birding and his annual role as Santa Claus passing out gifts to branch children. “The kids all like ‘Uncle Tom’” said Bob Linczer. Throughout his tenure as PBC Tom worked full-time as a legal assistant specializing in medical malpractice while Mary worked first as a parish secretary then for the marriage tribunal of the local Catholic diocese. Of Mary Alana Busekrus said ""She is always eager to share life with others by serving them. She brings meals to new moms or to sick community members helps with cleaning or moving and prays over or reaches out to those in need sharing her contagious humor and joy.""  “Tom did a wonderful job” Kevin Ranaghan said. “He was personally available for pastoral help for anyone in the branch. He always made a strong contribution to the branch review meetings every spring. I have the highest respect for his long service. He and Mary are known for their hospitality; they hosted many guests over the years.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4891
4851,Sept. 25 2015 11:38 a.m.,In Portland Growth of Trinity Academy Brings Changes,"Students at Trinity Academy in Portland playing outside before all school orientation. Story by Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly. Photo by Lisa Ficker. Trinity Academy in Portland began its fifth year in September with 59 students in grades 6 to 12 up from 46 last year and a faculty and staff of 21. Along with the growth Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools has announced that the school has become a new Trinity Member School. This means Trinity Academy will license the Trinity curriculum and maintain an ongoing training relationship with Trinity's teachers and administrative leaders. Trinity Academy joins The Wilberforce School in Princeton NJ as a Trinity Member School. ""Trinity Academy's development has been quick and they've created a wonderful school"" Kerry said. ""Head of School Jo Clark and her staff have done a fantastic job."" The school's growth has led to other changes: just last year it had moved into a 10000-square-foot building but this year's increase in enrollment demanded more space. The landlord local Christian businessman Haddish Tarekegn had the remaining empty floor remodeled over the summer to give the academy two new classrooms a bigger common space and a significantly larger faculty room. The school's ninth grade humane letters class is now taught in separate sections for boys and girls and the school intends to add other separate classes in the future a move that makes Trinity Academy ""more like our model Trinity Schools"" Jo Clark said. Trinity Academy has attracted new faculty and staff from other branches of the community and elsewhere. This year the school hired Patrick Gaffney (formerly of Servant Branch) and Martha Olson (Vancouver-Portland) to teach full-time. Lisa Ficker (formerly of South Bend) is now serving as a school administrator. All three are graduates of Trinity School at River Ridge. ""The people attracted me to the school"" said third-year faculty member Chelsea Jones.  Several months after she started teaching Chelsea decided to join the People of Praise. ""After my interviews for employment Jo invited me over for dinner with her family. Her next door neighbors the Kabeles and her sister and brother-in-law the Shreveses were also there. They were some of the kindest holiest people I had ever met. After that I was all in."" Two formerly part-time teachers Dr. Francie Longshore and Patrick Tomassi have shifted to teaching full-time this year bringing the total of full-time faculty to eight. The school currently has 11 part-time faculty and staff as well. Members of the Vancouver-Portland branch many of whom are not parents of Trinity Academy students serve on the school board and advisory council. Charlie Fraga president of the school board said Trinity Academy's growth is due in part to branch members who live near the school telling their neighbors about it. As a result many Trinity Academy families became familiar with the People of Praise. ""These parents know us and trust us so they are sending their kids to our school"" Charlie said. Forty-eight of the school's students come from families outside the People of Praise. Charlie added that the school's growth has also resulted in growth in the branch and in its Action team and has caused a resurgence in community households. ""The three members moving here from other branches are single and they wanted to live in household. That's a good development for our branch."" Trinity Academy was founded by the Vancouver-Portland branch in 2011. From the beginning the faculty were trained in the Trinity approach by Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) and his Academy Project which aims to offer Trinity's vision of Christian education to independent schools. ""Andrew and his team were invaluable in the launching of Trinity Academy"" Jo said. ""In countless phone calls emails and trips to Portland they provided excellent counsel and training for us and they called us on with faithful encouragement."" Last year the school graduated its first class of five students. Jo commented ""Members of our first graduating class were accepted at some great colleges including the University of Notre Dame and Holy Cross College.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4851
4821,Sept. 1 2015 10:11 a.m.,What To Expect When You're Expecting Pope Francis,Pope Francis visited victims of Typhoon Yolanda in January. Story by Sean Connolly. Photo by Benhur Arcayan (Malacanang Photo Bureau) [Public domain] via Wikimedia Commons. Pope Francis is not coming to the U.S. to damn Americans for our wealth or our love of SUVs. He will arrive not as a critic but as a missionary one who will affirm what is best in the US before he challenges our choices. And he is likely to disarm and even charm those of us who believing the pundits are braced for harsh words from the Holy Father. That was the message of a talk on the September visit of Pope Francis by the British journalist Austen Ivereigh delivered in Chicago last week. Ivereigh the author of The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope knows something of Francis’s complex character and his innovative modus operandi. He says the pope is a “political animal the greatest Argentine politician since Perón.” Yet he also “hates confrontation” and is known to be “very anxious about this visit.” It is hard to predict what will happen when Pope Francis brings his signature style — spontaneity openness to the Holy Spirit speaking from the heart — to our shores for the first time. Ivereigh suggests that the big story of the trip will be found in small gestures “particularly when Francis is with the people.” His actions will speak volumes: Pope Francis plans to address Congress and then visit homeless residents of Washington D.C. He will speak at Independence Hall from the same lectern Lincoln used to deliver the Gettysburg Address. The speeches and their inevitable focus on big issues will challenge said Ivereigh but they may not be what most pricks consciences or moves the crowds closer to God. Francis the missionary has many types of arrows in his quiver. As Ivereigh explained in his talk and in his biography the intellectual and political lenses through which Pope Francis sees the US are distinctively Latin American. Jorge Mario Bergoglio has long had political interests. As a child he absorbed the stories of his grandmother a Catholic social activist in Italy before she emigrated to Argentina. In his teenage years Bergoglio went to the meetings of all three political parties and Ivereigh suggests that he may have been “torn between a vocation to the priesthood and a vocation to politics.” He felt an affinity for the popular nationalism of Perón and explored socialism but by the 1970s he had become linked to a group of Uruguayan and Argentine Catholic thinkers — “the River Plate School”. They were part of the liberation theology movement but they rejected Marxism and broke away from better-known liberationist thinkers. Instead of class warfare they valued popular religion and nationalism believing that a renewal of holiness and culture could liberate the poor. Among their leaders was Alberto Methol Ferré a Uruguayan philosopher who Ivereigh says had a strong influence on Bergoglio. Methol Ferré and Bergoglio championed a vision of a unified Latin America which would draw strength from its Catholic roots while avoiding socialism and unchecked free-market capitalism. The ideas of the River Plate School form the intellectual framework through which Pope Francis sees and will challenge Americans but they have been little noticed by US commentators. Ivereigh reports that sadly Methol Ferré’s writings are languishing in boxes in a Montevideo library uncatalogued and un-digitized. When Francis speaks to Congress the media will focus on what he says or doesn’t say about abortion immigration gay marriage and climate change but Ivereigh suggests that a call to renewed political life will be the true heart of his message. Pope Francis wants politicians who are “close to the realities of the people that they serve who are above all attentive to the excluded and the marginalized.” As he showed on his July trip to Bolivia in a speech to members of popular movements he also knows how to bypass the politicians and speak directly to the people tapping into their desire for change. “He comes as a pope with a vocation to renew politics leading change from below” says Ivereigh. This is a moment when change from below is already stirring in America but perhaps its biggest instigator won’t be running for the presidency. Instead he may be a Latin American from an immigrant family one who takes his name from a great populist saint of the 13th-century. As Ivereigh put it “It could be one of the great and defining visits of his pontificate and who knows a historic turning point for the United States.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4821
4793,Aug. 12 2015 4:47 p.m.,In Shreveport Praise Academy Opens Its Doors,Photos by Brigette Mysliwiec. Our new primary school in Shreveport’s Lakeside/Allendale neighborhood opened its doors on Tuesday August 11. Praise Academy at Lakeside started with five students on day one with three more added today (Wednesday) bringing the total to 8. The school is located at 1434 Yale Avenue a house at the center of the row of homes where our Christians in Mission team members live.  The students who range from pre-kindergarteners through fifth graders spent their first day learning about the school environment. The school includes separate spaces for reading math school prayer meals (breakfast and lunch) and naps as well as a charming loft for students to read on their own. The first day also included a nature study using figs from the fig tree in front of Ron and Ruthanne Seitz’s home.   [embed][/embed]   The school day starts with breakfast at 7:45 followed by morning prayer at 8:15. School lets out at 3:10. “Yesterday as I walked down the block I saw CIM team members standing on their porches watching the children gather for the first day of school. We are all excited to see it get off the ground” said David Zimmel who leads the Christians in Mission team.  The staff includes Joan Pingel (principal) Colleen Bowar (teacher and dean of girls) and Kevin McShane (business manager and dean of boys). Angie Simmons a neighbor has volunteered to prepare lunch for the students. Many other CIM team members are playing supporting roles including menu planning security and after school care. Libby Grondin a violinist and Suzuki instructor is teaching music as a volunteer. Word is spreading about the school. “I’ve seen several cars drive slowly by our sign for the school taking down the phone number” David says. He expects more students to enroll this week.

4778,Aug. 10 2015 10:43 a.m.,Missionaries Travel to Tennessee,Rus Lyons John Earhart and John Gruber caught a ride with Andrew (second from left) on the road to Memphis TN. Story by Elizabeth Grams and Chris Meehan. Photo by Rus Lyons. The community’s missionary work extended to Tennessee this summer thanks to two short excursions led by Evansville missionary Rus Lyons. Rus traveled to Nashville July 6-10 and Memphis July 20-25 bringing two brothers in the community with him each time. The men visited poor neighborhoods in each city knocking on doors and talking to people on the street. They shared words from the Lord and prayed with people for healing conversion and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Like Jesus’ first disciples they traveled without definite plans for where they would find food and shelter. They hitched rides from truckers begged for food and water and stayed with local residents who agreed to house them on short notice. The men carried on their persons only a few Bibles notepads rain jackets toiletries IDs a pocket knife and phones with chargers. Rus has made these kinds of “on faith” trips before—13 of them since 2008 but these two trips were the first since 2013. “The Lord put it on Rus’s heart to make these trips” says Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty “and it seemed to all the Mission leaders like a good time for us to get to know more people as the Lord leads and to get to know what’s going on in more locations up and down our target area in the Mississippi River valley.” In Memphis Rus John Earhart and John Gruber (Servant Branch) preached to a crowd outside a two-story apartment building. “Jesus talks quite a bit about hell” Rus called out to the people on the second-floor balcony “because he doesn't want anyone to go there.” A group of men gathered around a truck in the apartment’s parking lot and interjected frequent questions and replies. One man knelt down on the gravel made a public confession of his sins and recommitted his life to Christ. “There are a lot of people hungry for the Lord in Memphis” observed John Earhart after the trip. In Nashville George Kane Ben Mysliwiec and Rus brought well-timed words of comfort from the Lord. One afternoon they told a man parking his truck that God wanted to fill him with joy. “Wow I needed that” he replied. Moments before he had prayed “I’m afraid to ask you God if it could get any worse.” He explained that he’d recently lost his house and job and his wife had divorced him. On another day the missionaries brought a message of God’s love to a family grieving the loss of a relative. “I was just praying that God would send someone to pray with my family!” a young man in the group told them. The missionaries prayed with the family on their porch and later the man asked to be prayed with for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Along the way the missionaries found food shelter and transportation from all kinds of people. They received rides from a trucker who picked them up on two different occasions and drove them a total of several hundred miles from a pair of gospel singers and from a Sikh who heard from them about Jesus’ resurrection for the first time. One family they met pooled all the money they had in the house–$29–for the three men. Managers at Popeye’s and Hardee’s restaurants provided free meals. A college student who knew a friend of the missionaries put them up for the night. Another family’s 14-year-old daughter used her birthday money to buy them food. A Christian couple whom Jim Schenkel (Muncie) found through his nephew  hosted them a few nights. A young girl who heard they needed food and water ran to grab some cold water bottles from her refrigerator and thrust them into the missionaries’ hands. Rus plans to take at least one more group on a hitchhiking mission in the Mississippi River valley this year. “Please keep praying that the Holy Spirit guide us and revive our land!” he says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4778
4764,June 26 2015 5:05 p.m.,Two Houses Arrive in Allendale,"One neighbor on the block told a CIM team member ""I looked out my window and I thought Well I guess someone bought the lot next door!"" Story by Elizabeth Grams. Photos by Laura Brummer Joe Bulger and Jeanette Duddy.  Two new modular houses rolled into the Allendale neighborhood on June 11 and 13. Christians in Mission members cheered as their future homes arrived at 1934 Dove Street and at 1935 Jordan Street. The houses face two different streets but share a backyard. They are two blocks away from the Yale Avenue location where other community households live. “These houses are coming just in time to free up space for our new school” says Mission Coordinator David Zimmel who oversaw the acquisition of the houses. “They are both an answer to prayer and the fruit of our neighbors’ support.” After wiring and plumbing are finished John and Colleen Bowar will live at 1934 Dove which they are renting from another People of Praise couple. Ben and Kathleen Reinhardt currently living at 1434 Yale will move into 1935 Jordan. That will leave the Yale property available for the start of the community’s new school Praise Academy at Lakeside which begins classes at that location on August 11.  Paul Barrett surveys the preparation for the house foundations on Dove and Jordan Streets just a short walk from his family’s home on Yale Ave. Plans were complicated by a recent Shreveport law that prohibited modular housing within the city limits without special permission. In fact last November the city zoning board had denied permission to several petitioners applying for zoning variances for similar types of modular housing. On March 11 David Jeannette Duddy and one of their neighbors Johnny went before the board requesting permits for modular housing at the empty lots on Dove and Jordan Streets. David described the community’s work in the Allendale neighborhood. Then Johnny also spoke in favor of the variance: “The People of Praise are good people. When you need help they’ll help you. When you need a ride they’ll get you. When you’ve got a broken window they’ll fix it. I think you guys got to do everything you can to help them do their project.” “We were really asking for a lot” said David “but the zoning board approved our project unanimously. They caught the spirit of what we’re trying to do thanks especially to the support of Johnny and our other neighbors. Since then everybody I’ve talked to about it agrees that there was some miraculous help from the city to get this going. The guys dropping off the houses asked how did you succeed in getting these houses here?”  John and Colleen Bowar in front of their new home 1934 Dove St. Both houses arrived on trailers in two sections and were placed on concrete foundations laid a few days earlier. The sight of two halves of a house rolling along the hilly Allendale streets drew Christians in Mission team members and other curious Allendale neighbors out of their homes. With the start of the school year coming in August and the arrival of Action teams June 22 the CIM team needed to build quickly to ease their housing crunch--more quickly than volunteer labor would allow. They chose manufactured housing as a cost-effective alternative to traditional construction: in their case says David roughly $50 per square foot instead of $100 per square foot. They wanted new homes that would fit in with the neighborhood’s existing architecture and be affordable to most Allendale neighbors. In the fall David and other team members had viewed one company’s modular homes in their warehouse and he was impressed with their product. “It was kind of a no-brainer. When you’re looking at building a new house you usually have to decide whether it will be inexpensive or fast or well-built. If you’re lucky you get to pick two of those. This company’s houses are all three.”  Patti Deakin Pat Malone and Marianne Duddy watch the new houses coming in. Each of the new homes is designed for common life and hospitality: four bedrooms and three baths with a central open area functioning as the living room dining room and kitchen. Colleen says “I’m really looking forward to moving in. When they put in the house I was talking with two of the women neighbors and realized one of them lives directly across from the new house. It was fun thinking about her being a neighbor.” The new houses are very close together: “Close enough to toss a tomato from one house to the other” says Colleen.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4764

4730,May 27 2015 4:07 p.m.,Cardinal George and the People of Praise,Story by Sean Connolly.Photo by Adam-Bielawski via WikiMediaCommons. Pope Francis is known for his openness to the Spirit his emphasis on evangelism and his embrace of evangelical Protestants and Pentecostals. A little-known story about Cardinal Francis George who died on April 17 reveals that he too was open to the Spirit and to graces from other Christian denominations. The story starts in 1990 after Bishop George was appointed to lead the diocese of Yakima Washington. There he met Fr. Perron Auve a diocesan priest who became his vicar general. Auve was a charismatic Catholic and a leader in the People of Praise a community of families and single people from many Christian denominations. The People of Praise grew from the charismatic renewal that swept through the Catholic Church in the late 1960s and ‘70s until it had impacted 36 percent of U.S. Catholics. Auve described the People of Praise to George and put him in touch with Paul DeCelles the community’s overall coordinator. He also introduced George to Joel Kibler a layman who is the head of the Brotherhood a group of men in the People of Praise who live lives of dedicated celibacy. Because the People of Praise is a predominantly lay and ecumenical community its leaders had to face questions about how they would relate to ordained ministers. DeCelles one of the 29 founders had discussed this with fellow founder Kevin Ranaghan before the community began in 1971. In 1981 DeCelles and Kibler had talked about finding a way for Brotherhood members who felt a call to the Catholic priesthood to receive ordination. This was a complicated situation. Catholic priests in the Brotherhood would need to be able to live in households with brothers who were Presbyterian Pentecostal or Baptist. As covenanted members of the People of Praise the priests would have made permanent commitments to a community which according to its foundational documents could have a Protestant as its overall coordinator. While pursuing a path for community members to be ordained DeCelles Auve Kibler and others had consulted canon lawyers and approached four US Catholic bishops. All four had passed on the idea but George took a different view. DeCelles says George was warm to the idea from the start. In a later meeting George said to Kibler “What you want to do is from the Holy Spirit. You have something to tell the Church.” George himself already had a deep understanding of community from his experience in the Oblates of Mary Immaculate—he had been vicar general of the order for 12 years and had traveled the world visiting missionary Oblate communities. “He understood community life more than most other bishops” as Auve recalls. In June of 1991 George attended a People of Praise prayer meeting in South Bend Indiana the community’s headquarters where he also met with a small group of community leaders. During the meeting George expressed his admiration for the way that the Brotherhood paid all their expenses from a single checking account—living in common the way the first Christians had done. With George’s encouragement DeCelles Kibler and several others continued the slow and difficult work of crafting the constitutions and statutes that would establish the Brotherhood as a Private Association of the Faithful within the Catholic Church. Fr. William Woestman a canon lawyer and Oblate whom George had recommended also assisted them. Kibler recalls sitting across a desk from George in 1996 while they read through a draft of the constitutions. George had been positive on the draft but he expressed disapproval after reading the section which had described how the Brotherhood could have Catholic and Protestant members. “He told me that I had to insert a sentence that said that the consciences of Protestants would be respected” Kibler recalls. In George’s view the Church was changing. Protestants could be part of a canonically-established Catholic association but they had to be assured that the Catholic members would not pressure them to convert. George recommended looking at the Declaration on Religious Freedom from Vatican II (Dignitatis Humanae 2) for inspiration. After he had been appointed Archbishop of Portland George invited the men of the Brotherhood to move there and in 1996 a few Brotherhood members began attending Mt. Angel Seminary. Archbishop John Vlazny George’s successor in Portland formally approved the Brotherhood’s statutes in 1999 and since that time four Brotherhood members have been ordained as priests. In 2014 Pope Francis appointed one of them Peter Smith as the auxiliary bishop of Portland Oregon. Bishop Smith who also knew George personally said of him “He was very open to new movements and the movement of the Holy Spirit within the Church. He was very forward- thinking while being firmly anchored in Church teaching. The whole notion of him being this arch conservative is so wrong. We are part of a lay ecclesial movement with an ecumenical dimension and he took a very positive position—the Holy Spirit is at work here so we need to be open to the Spirit.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4730
4685,May 19 2015 4:03 p.m.,Building Brotherhood in Jamaica,Story by Chris Meehan. Photos by Joe Bulger and Joseph Mutidjo. Eleven men and nine boys drove out of Kingston on a Friday evening in early May for a weekend packed with games singing prayer laughter and brotherhood in the lush foothills north of the city. Buildings gave way to banana plantations cattle and dirt roads as the group approached their destination—River Edge a camp and retreat center located in a vibrant green valley with a small river winding through it. These campouts started more than 20 years ago as father-son events but this year six of the nine boys came through branch members’ friendship with the sisters of a local Missionaries of Charity outreach.   As the group settled in some of the boys who ranged from four to 17 years old played dominoes in the cabin. Saturday began early with stretching exercises breakfast and group prayer. Some of the men gave sharings about God’s work in their lives. Group activities included a scavenger hunt with clues: “Find five pieces of fibrous material of the same length” and “use the materials to construct a device that will guide travellers.” A team of judges attempted to rate the results but a jovial dispute broke out over whether the pointing scarecrow or the weathervane made with oranges won the day. There was time each day for cavorting in the pools and eddies of the shallow river games of football (which North Americans know as soccer) and checkers. The group opened the Lord's Day with prayer and a meal followed by a campfire with singing missionary stories from Joe Bulger (visiting from Allendale) and roasted marshmallows. “Most of these boys don't know their fathers” says Kevin Rodriguez who helped organize the event with Joseph Mutidjo. “We want to give them the opportunity to see how real men behave to see and experience men of God in action. For instance they notice that we don't cuss. When we get upset we don’t get boisterous. We are competitive but remain respectful of one another.”  Sunday morning the men prayed with boys who had specific prayer requests and Locksley Robinson then invited everyone to pray with one another for more of the Holy Spirit. “I made new friends” said 11-year-old Tiaquan Dunn who didn’t know anyone else in the group before Friday. “They live close to me and since the campout we play football a lot.” Sr. Patsy who works for the Missionaries of Charity outreach and knows the boys that came to the campout made a point of telling Joseph the following week how much they had enjoyed the weekend. One of the boys asked Joseph when they would do a campout again. Locksley says “We continue to hold these annual gatherings because we enjoy our brotherhood together both young and old. At the same time we realize that that sort of manly relating is sorely needed in our Jamaican society today so we open it up to others hoping they will share in the fun and fellowship and encounter Christ as we relate to one another.” Renaldo Grant a 17-year-old put it this way: “It was very fun. I just wish it could be longer. A weekend is too short.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4685
4677,May 5 2015 10:25 a.m.,Pope Francis Tony Palmer an iPhone & the Holy Spirit,Tony Palmer and Pope Francis. Story by Sean Connolly. Photos courtesy of Life Today.  It all started with an iPhone. On January 14 2014 Tony Palmer a charismatic bishop from a little-known Anglican communion used his phone to shoot a video of a friend—Pope Francis leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics. In the video Francis opened his heart to a group of Pentecostal leaders affiliated with Kenneth Copeland’s ministry. “I am speaking to you as a brother” Francis told them. “Let us allow our yearning to grow because that will allow us find each other to embrace one another and together to worship Jesus Christ as the only Lord of history.” He added: “the miracle of unity has begun.” This is the story of that miracle. Its threads cut through the spiritual divides that separate mainline Protestants Catholics and Pentecostals. But in tracing them the main protagonist is the Holy Spirit which means that anything could happen. The week after recording the video Bishop Palmer traveled to Texas to introduce Francis’s greeting to the Pentecostals. He was uniquely positioned to do so. Palmer had given his life to Jesus in a Pentecostal church in South Africa. He was married to an Italian Catholic. He had become an Anglican priest and bishop and he had adopted a Catholic Cardinal from Buenos Aires named Jorge Mario Bergoglio (later Pope Francis) as one of his spiritual fathers. In a fiery speech that set the stage Palmer read from the 1999 Lutheran-Catholic “Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification.” In that document the two confessions declared that they share a common understanding of the basis for salvation—and therefore that the central theological disagreement of the Reformation had been resolved. As Palmer put it: “The protest is over.” Methodists had joined Lutherans and Catholics in signing the declaration in 2006 yet millions of Christians had never heard of the declaration and so were living their lives as if the protest was still in force. But Palmer didn’t dwell on the past. He had come to the conference to play the role of John the Baptist of a prophet burning to announce something greater that was yet to come. “We are living in an incredibly important generation” he declared. After watching the pope’s greeting on a giant screen the Pentecostal leaders rose to their feet. They prayed for Francis enthusiastically with their hands raised in tongues and in the Spirit. “My dear sir” Kenneth Copeland said. “Thank you so from the bottom of our hearts.” Francis’s greeting was not supposed to become public but the month after the conference in Texas someone posted video from the conference on YouTube. “It went wild” Palmer’s wife Emiliana told me. Palmer was bombarded with emails from evangelicals and Pentecostals who wanted to be part of the unity miracle. Emiliana called Francis wondering what to do. He told her to “let it go” — the wind of the Spirit was blowing. In June 2014 the video led to a meeting in Rome that included Palmer Francis Copeland and another TV preacher James Robison. All told the leaders at the meeting represented more than 1.8 billion Christians including the Pentecostal movement the fastest-growing segment of the church.  Pope Francis and James Robison. The meeting included a two-hour lunch with prayer hugs laughter and even a high-five from Robison to the Pope. Francis as Robison put it spoke fervently “on the need for everyone — Protestant Catholic whatever — to have a personal encounter with Christ.” Lit up by the message Robison said “Sir as an evangelist that deserves a high-five.” Because the video of Palmer’s introduction had shot round the world alongside Francis’s greeting Palmer’s light was shining out perhaps more brightly than it ever had; then just as quickly it went out. On July 20 2014 a car struck the motorcycle Palmer was riding near his home in England. He was in surgery for 10 hours before he died a 48-year-old man who left behind his wife Emiliana and their two young adult children not to mention many shocked Christians. Palmer was born in England and moved to South Africa when he was 10. He met Emiliana there. She came from a wealthy Italian family who had traveled the world before settling in South Africa. Though neither was a practicing Christian during their engagement they attended a conference at the Christian Family Church in Johannesburg. The pastor gave an altar call and Tony and Emiliana went up and dedicated their lives to Jesus. Later that afternoon they went to a party in a wealthy neighborhood. Tony was offered drugs which he had taken in the past but something had changed. Emiliana recalls: “He looked at me and said ‘Emi I don’t belong here anymore.’” They left together. After getting married Tony and Emiliana quit their jobs so they could go full-time as door-to-door evangelists. They hit the streets for eight or nine hours a day watching VHS tapes of Kenneth Copeland’s preaching for inspiration before they went out. According to a video on Copeland’s website the Palmers led 167 families to Christ during that time. During the 1990s the Palmers came in contact with the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. As Tony put it later “When my wife found out that she could be charismatic evangelical Pentecostal and Catholic she wanted to reconnect to her Catholic roots.” Their children were raised Catholic but Tony remained an evangelical. In 2003 Tony got an email from Matteo Calisi a leader in the Catholic charismatic renewal in Italy inviting the Palmers to move to Italy to minister within the Italian Catholic charismatic renewal. But the invitation was conditional on the Palmers raising their own financial support. Just one couple agreed to back them financially Kenneth and Gloria Copeland. The Palmers sold their car and house and used the money to support their new work. While in Italy Tony joined the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches (CEEC) a young Anglican group with its base in Florida that had grown from a circle of charismatic evangelicals who had felt a hunger for the sacraments. With the CEEC Tony became an Anglican priest and later a bishop. The CEEC is a communion that is independent of the Anglican Communion led by the Archbishop of Canterbury but claims historic apostolic succession for its bishops. The story of how Palmer came to be friends with Bergoglio begins in 2003. That year Calisi Palmer’s co-worker helped start an ecumenical group in Argentina. The group brought evangelical and Catholic leaders together for fellowship and prayer and sponsored an annual charismatic rally which Bergoglio began attending in 2004. For the first two years he went as a spectator but something changed in 2006. What happened is related in Austen Ivereigh’s biography The Great Reformer. The cardinal spent the morning as usual seated along with everyone else but in the afternoon he came up to give a speech to the 5000 Christians gathered there. He “asked the preachers first to pray for him and knelt with his head bowed as they held their hands over him” Ivereigh writes. The pastor leading the prayer Norberto Saracco “ended with a crescendo of invocation: ‘Fill him with your Holy Spirit and power Lord! In the name of Jesus!’” Ivereigh describes how Bergoglio then preached with “new fervor” with “passion urgency clarity and strength.” After the conference the cardinal started praying regularly with a group of evangelical pastors. Later he arranged for some of them to preach at retreats for the Catholic priests of the Buenos Aires archdiocese aimed at helping them have a personal relationship with Jesus. Also in 2006 Palmer Calisi and a few others went to visit Bergoglio in connection with their ecumenical work. He asked to hear their stories. Palmer explained how his family attended Catholic mass together but he could not receive communion a fact that had perplexed the Palmers’ children. When he finished “Father Mario just wept” Emiliana told me. (The Palmers usually spoke affectionately of Bergoglio calling him simply “Father Mario.”) Bergoglio asked Palmer if they could keep in touch. With phone calls emails and occasional face-to-face meetings their friendship grew. During one of those conversations Palmer spoke to Bergoglio about whether he should become Catholic. He described the cardinal’s response to Ivereigh: “[Bergoglio] told me that we need to have bridge-builders. He counseled me not to take the step because it looked like I was choosing a side and I would cease to be a bridge-builder.” When Bergoglio was elected as Pope Francis Palmer expected that their friendship would be permanently changed. So he was surprised when after Christmas of 2013 Francis called him at home and asked when he could come to Rome for a visit. During that meeting Palmer told Francis about the Copeland conference asking if Francis would like to send a message. “Why don’t we make a video?” Francis said after a pause. Then he gave the greeting that went viral on YouTube. Palmer’s funeral was held in Bath England a Catholic requiem mass at which Bruno Ierullo a Pentecostal from Toronto and an ecumenical leader who knew Palmer sat near the altar along with the priests and bishops. Emiliana tearfully read a message from Pope Francis: “We were great friends. . . . Those of us who love him feel impelled by his zeal to follow in his footsteps to walk without rest preparing the bride one single bride for the bridegroom who will come.” In October Francis met with Emiliana and a contingent of bishops from the CEEC. He announced that Emiliana and Archbishop Robert Wise had agreed to “carry the torch this dream which was Tony’s: this dream of being able to walk in communion.” It is too early to tell what will come next in this work that the Holy Spirit brought about through Tony and Francis. The wound of Tony’s death is still raw and from the moment Tony took out his iPhone no one was following a script. One possibility stems from a draft document that Palmer Copeland and Robison brought to Francis in June 2014. Ivereigh spoke to Palmer just after the meeting “Palmer told me the draft declaration has three elements: the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed which Catholics and evangelicals share; the core of the Catholic-Lutheran declaration of 1999 making clear there is no disagreement over justification by faith; as well as a final section asserting that Catholics and evangelicals are now ‘united in mission because we are declaring the same Gospel.’” Palmer’s hope was that Protestant and Catholic leaders would sign the document sometime in 2017 during the 500th anniversary of the Reformation and the 50th anniversary of the Catholic charismatic renewal. “I’m convinced that this is a highly significant historical moment” Ivereigh told me. “We will look back and say this was the moment where Catholics and evangelicals came together.” The key says Ivereigh is not simply Francis’s openness to building friendships across denominations but the fact that Francis is charismatic. “All Catholic charismatics should now be saying that this is a charismatic pope—he is. And that’s why Copeland and Robison and these others are responding to Francis. They’re saying look this guy is a man of the Spirit. He is a Spirit-filled pope responding to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and discerning that this is the moment the kairos and that he must do what he can to bring this about.” This miracle of unity began with something small: a private video message that became public. It fueled a coming together of Tony’s evangelical and Pentecostal friends with his Catholic friend Francis while sweeping in hundreds of thousands of others through a 21st century spiritual agent—YouTube. For it to grow larger still requires something even more profound the fulfillment by the Spirit of an ancient spiritual promise: “Unless a grain falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain; but if it dies it bears much fruit.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4677
4659,April 21 2015 4:40 p.m.,Singing Filming and Planning at the 2015 Action Conference,Story by Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly. Photos by Patricia Olson and Margaret DeCelles.  More than 200 students and adults from 11 community locations came to South Bend last weekend for an Action conference the first community-wide Action gathering in three years. “Never have I seen so many people devoted to what they are doing and focused on God” said Cameron Huntington a high school freshman from Minnesota. It was a working conference and participants spent several hours each day designing camp activities writing music producing videos or planning Action activities for the 2015-16 school year. In the music track they sang together listened to classical music and spiritual songs in addition to composing their own songs. On the final day they performed a camp song written by Stephen Kabele Abby Earhart James Smith Myracle Newsome and Sharon Joh about God’s manifestation to Elijah in the “still small voice.”  Camp track attendees planned and ran a day camp for youngsters aged 5-12 in the South Bend branch a trial run for this summer’s camps in Shreveport and Indianapolis. They performed skits (David and Goliath) taught about forgiveness helped the girls weave cloth headbands and ran an obstacle course with the boys. Video track participants took a crash course in visual storytelling and created their own short films. They developed storyboards filmed with iPhones and edited their films in time to show them on the final day of the conference. The track voted for the two best films--a short film of a missionary encounter created by Chris Smith Christian Runyon and Stephen Magill and a stylized film showing a job interview created by Joe Feeks Tess Pingel Ruthie Olson and David Preuss. A planning track focused on what Action students can do during the school year. They articulated a vision statement for local Action divisions brainstormed ways to improve Action events all year round and discussed fundraising. They went door-to-door in a nearby neighborhood asking people to join them in prayer for the nation. They knocked on 166 doors and prayed with 30 people.  The conference also included a variety of talks presentations and reports. Gabe Yohe a missionary in Evansville who was a high school student during the last Action conference shared his testimony as did his fellow missionary Ben Mysliwiec. Sarah Loughran (South Bend) gave a report on the elementary school the community will open in Allendale next fall. Action student Stephen Kabele (Vancouver-Portland) explained the Action coaching program while Mary Raway (Servant Branch) explained why she's in Action to the many newcomers attending the conference. “It was great hearing what Action divisions are doing in their branches hearing why the People of Praise is in the Mississippi River Valley and knowing that we have a plan” said Olivia Griggs a high school senior in South Bend. Exuberant praise and worship punctuated the sessions. Jared Gonzalez (Indianapolis Triangle) led the music with help from a large band of high school students playing drums bass electric guitar electric cello and mandolin. An evening variety show featured classical chamber music barbershop singing ukulele rap and several songs composed by the performers themselves. Conference participants served and cleaned up for all the meals enjoyed long walks in the spring weather late-night basketball and soccer games (for the boys) and a late-night live action Clue game at the Greenlawn mansion (for the girls).  The conference ended with a prayer meeting led by Pat Murphy (Servant Branch) during which the crowd sang music they’d learned in the last few days and received an invitation from missionary Nick Holovaty to start preparing now to join the Lord’s campaign in the Mississippi River Valley. Peter Kabele a senior from Portland has already noticed fruit from the conference. “Every single day I’ve had conversations with people who went to the conference about the Holy Spirit the changes the Lord has made in their lives and about what we want do in Action moving forward.” “The Lord certainly showed up” says program coordinator Mike Zusi. “The South Bend branch poured itself out to serve us. I can't say enough about the administrative work of Catherine Bulger—the conference wouldn't have happened without her—or the dedicated service of Andrea Kane who organized all the food and housing. I expect we'll be seeing the fruit of this conference for quite some time.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4659
4626,April 18 2015 2:47 p.m.,Remembering Jeanne DeCelles,Jeanne Ireland (Cross) DeCelles passed away on April 17 2015 after a prolonged illness surrounded by her loving and compassionate husband Paul and many devoted family members and friends.  Jeanne was born at St. Charles Hospital in Aurora Illinois on December 26 1933 to Harold and Helen (Niman) Cross.  Her family moved to Kansas City Missouri where she first met Paul in their ninth grade class at Bishop Hogan High School.  Jeanne was a spirited red-headed beauty who delighted in beautiful clothing shoes and the beach but she was also committed to living an extraordinarily apostolic life full of good works.  Having attended Stephens College for Women for one year she was eventually able to earn her RN at the College of St.Teresa fulfilling a longtime desire to care for the sick.  She graduated from nursing school in 1955 and while practicing nursing she earned the respect of her peers and the affection of her patients who often showered small gifts of appreciation on her.  She married the love of her life Paul DeCelles on June 16 1956 at St. Ann’s in Prairie Village Kansas.  Jeanne loved to travel which was a particularly useful attribute in the early years of her marriage a time marked by frequent moves: from Maryland to New York to New Jersey to Florida and Switzerland and finally to South Bend Indiana. She was an extraordinarily organized traveler and free spirit welcoming all of the new adventures with an open heart.  During these early years of marriage Jeanne first learned to husband modest resources to create a lovely and welcoming home while rearing five children and supporting her husband’s work. A consummate and energetic homemaker she tastefully decorated her home with a keen eye for seasonal celebrations and she never missed a birthday for her children sixteen grandchildren and her many friends.  She was an early advocate for and member of the local chapter of Right to Life and an outspoken advocate for the frail and vulnerable.  Jeanne was a leader in the Cursillo and Charismatic Renewal movements in the 1960’s and in 1971 she became one of twenty-nine founding members of the ecumenical charismatic covenant community the People of Praise.  From 1983-1992 she was the editor-in-chief of the community’s publication New Heaven/New Earth.  She was an able and spiritually astute companion for her husband Paul.  Her cooking prowess was admired far and wide and her ability to organize a large household was legendary.  Over the course of three decades Jeanne provided a home for nineteen household members.  As a leader of the women in the People of Praise she was responsible for much of the formation of the community’s teaching especially among the women and she designed and executed numerous retreats around the country.  Many women young and old knew her for her insightful practical pastoral care.  She served the members tirelessly her entire adult life preparing countless meals supplying comfort in times of duress keeping vigil beside the bed of the sick and the dying and employing all of those nursing skills she earned earlier in life.  Throughout her long illness Jeanne was a mild patient and loving member of her family suffering with an amicable sense of humor and a cooperative spirit.  A lifelong Catholic Jeanne was also a daily communicant for much of her life. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth...and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying “Behold the dwelling of God is with men.  He will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself will be with them; he will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more...” (Revelation 21: 1 3-4).  Jeanne is survived by her dear and beloved husband Paul and her five children: Paul Craig DeCelles Jr. of Chicago Ill; Peter Gregory DeCelles of Tucson AZ; Jeannette Marie DeCelles-Zwerneman of Falls Church VA; Mary Frances (DeCelles) Loughran of Falls Church VA; and John Michael DeCelles of South Bend IN.  She is also survived by sixteen beautiful grandchildren and her elder sister Patricia (Cross) Wilson. Viewing will take place Tuesday April 21 from 4:00-7:00 pm at the People of Praise Community Center located at 53666 North Ironwood Rd.  A wake will follow at 7:30 pm.  The funeral mass officiated by Fr. Doyle will be celebrated onWednesday April 22 at10:30 am at St. Joseph Catholic Church located at 226 N Hill St.  Burial will follow at Cedar Grove Cemetery located on Notre Dame Avenue.If you would like to make a charitable donation in Jeanne’s name please consider sending one to the People of Praise Mission Fund at 107 South Greenlawn Ave South Bend IN 46617.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4626

4525,April 1 2015 10:16 a.m.,Christian Storytelling Article Published on Religion Website,"A frame from Pope Francis's video greeting to a gathering of Pentecostal ministers in January 2014. Today on the website RealClearReligion you’ll find an article by our communications program coordinator Sean Connolly “Time to Return to Christian Storytelling.” The article is based on a talk Sean gave at the recent Leaders’ Conference for Men “Cutting to the Heart: How To Communicate in a Post-argument World.” Sean’s talk and others from the Leaders’ Conference will be available soon in video and audio versions on the People of Praise web site. Here is an excerpt:Alberto Methol Ferré a Uruguayan intellectual attended the Latin American bishops conference in Puebla Mexico in 1979. He took a taxi from the conference to his hotel and his driver asked ""Have you seen that with each passing day the Pope speaks better Spanish?""Ferré replied in a halfhearted way: ""If you say so it may be true.""But the driver raising his voice said ""Yes it is. And do you know why? Because he loves us.""With his broken Spanish Pope John Paul II had cut the taxi driver to the heart. But intellectuals who had been focused on ""analyzing what the pope said"" as the Uruguayan put it later in an interview had missed the meaning of his gesture.This style of communication -- cutting to the heart -- has not been much utilized in the public communications of the church in recent decades. Examine the debate over gay marriage and it's obvious that Christians relying on reasoned arguments and appeals to authority have not penetrated the hearts of the masses. While gay marriage proponents with all their talk of personal love have broadly resonated.Perhaps this is what Pope Francis was getting at when he urged the church to talk less about gay marriage and more about ""what makes the heart burn.""But Christians should not copy the secular communications strategy of the gay marriage movement. Cutting to the heart is a far older approach and a deeply Christian practice. In Acts 2 Luke records that after Peter rose to speak about his friend and teacher Jesus the people in Jerusalem were ""cut to the heart."" Following in Peter's footsteps countless Catholic and Protestant saints have aimed to win friends for God by resonating with that core muscle: Francis Ignatius of Loyola Teresa of Avila Philip Neri John XXIII John Wesley Smith Wigglesworth Billy Graham.Recently I was speaking to a group of leaders in the People of Praise an ecumenical Christian community I belong to in South Bend Indiana. I showed them clips from the viral video of Pope Francis greeting a group of Pentecostal leaders affiliated with Kenneth Copeland's ministry. I asked the leaders to call out adjectives that described the pope's communication style. Their responses: ""genuine"" ""sincere"" ""joyful"" ""humble"" ""warm"" ""vulnerable."" Let's add a few others: heartfelt spontaneous raw attractive beautiful and bold.You can read the rest of the article here: http://www.realclearreligion.org/articles/2015/04/01/time_to_return_to_christian_storytelling.html",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4525
4494,March 27 2015 4:32 p.m.,Holy Spirit Sighting: Portland Man Gets a Birthday Blast,"Dick Safranski surrounded by a few of his friends in the neighborhood.   Story by Chris Meehan. Photo by Beth Kabele. Dick Safranski an 82-year-old widower from Portland can't stop talking about the birthday gift his People of Praise neighbors gave him on January 26. That evening members of the Clark Kabele and Ridenour families crowded into his home and prayed with him to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. ""Getting prayed over was spectacular"" he says. The story began at the regular Monday night dinner that the Clark Kabele Brady and Ridenour families hold. They were talking about people they knew who might be open to being baptized in the Holy Spirit. (At their community meeting the day before they had heard a talk from the ""Spread the Fire"" series developed by Kevin Ranaghan and Louis Grams about praying with people for the baptism of the Holy Spirit.) Someone brought up Dick Safranski. Dick has lived in the same neighborhood-where several community families also live-for 19 years. He loved to walk around the block once or twice daily with Gloria his wife of 61 years. ""They knew everybody"" Pat Clark says. As Gloria battled cancer during the last six years of her life community families prayed over her many times. She died March 27 2013. During the dinner Pat noted that it was Dick's birthday and suggested the group go over and sing to him. Dan Kabele raised the stakes: ""Why don't we give him something that nobody else has given him?"" They all trooped over to his house but Dick was at his daughter's home for dinner so they sang into a cell phone before returning to Kabeles'. Dick arrived home minutes later to discover a message on his answering machine-muffled voices singing ""Happy Birthday."" He didn't recognize the number but called back. When the crowd realized Dick had returned they rushed back and sang to him again from his front porch. After they reminisced about Gloria and the blessings of his past year Dan said ""Dick we have something to give you for your birthday–would you like to be prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit?"" Dick's eyes welled up with tears and he replied that he had always loved it when they prayed with Gloria and he wanted prayer as well. Dick was struck by Beth Kabele's voice over his shoulder speaking in tongues. ""They talked about bringing the Holy Spirit into the house and me"" he remembers. ""They did and he did!"" The next morning Dick told his family and his parish priest about what had happened to him and since then as Dan says ""He's been telling everybody he knows."" Beth notes that Dick has always been God's man. ""His example of a faith-filled life has impacted those around him in the neighborhood. He is highly respected as a steady faithful good patient and loving man. That's why we were so drawn to him from the first days of meeting him and Gloria."" ""I was a 'cradle Catholic'"" says Dick ""growing up in a Polish family with seven children and a love of the church. I've always been active in my parish but after being prayed with I'm even more cognizant of what's going on there. The word 'spectacular' doesn't cover it. I felt different since being prayed with; God has compensated me for losing my sweetheart. My faith keeps getting deeper.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4494
4480,March 21 2015 10:29 a.m.,With Music Website Missionaries Share Songs and Joy,"People of Praise missionaries pickin' and grinnin' on a front porch in Evansville. Photo by George Kane. by Elizabeth Grams and Sean Connolly photo by George Kane. Our missionaries living in Evansville have launched a new website where anyone in the world can listen to songs they have written and performed: www.missionarymusic.org. Mike Zusi announced the site at the Leaders’ Conference for Men in South Bend last week during a talk on the role of music in community life. On the main page of the website visitors can listen to a playlist of all the songs (currently there are 21). The “Download” page includes downloadable PDF files with lyrics and chord sheets and downloadable tracks. A “Watch” page features YouTube videos that show the missionaries performing the songs. The songs include prayer meeting songs composed by the missionaries traditional hymns (“All Creatures of Our God and King”) spirituals (“Ride on King Jesus”) and performance pieces. The songs are performed in a variety of styles from bluegrass to rock to rap and they feature banjo cello guitar violin harmonica beatboxing and unaccompanied choral singing. “This music comes out of our life in the People of Praise” says Nick Holovaty who leads the missionaries. “It reflects the joys that come with living and working together and our personal experiences in the mission field. I hope that many people enjoy the music that it blesses them and that our music can get out to as many people as possible.” The site is designed so that listeners can easily spread the word about the music on Facebook Twitter and Google Plus as well as by email. Mary Timer a missionary with a background as a cellist designed and built the site with help from Dan Sullivan a web developer and an underway member of the new start in Evansville. “Music is a huge part of the life and outreach of the Missionary Company and that is in large part due to Chris Vieck a classically trained singer and choral director who led music in the South Bend branch for many years” says Nick. Music performed by the missionaries has been a staple at community weddings and at community summer camps over the past few years.  Kathleen Reinhardt said that the music the missionaries sang at her wedding to Ben Reinhardt in Shreveport in January was “just beautiful” and a profound reflection of the call to mission that she experiences in the community. “People have been emailing me asking for our chord sheets and encouraging us to let our light shine” says Mary. “This music is a gift from the Lord and we want to share it. So download it share it play it everywhere as often as you like!""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4480
4469,March 13 2015 9:30 p.m.,A People of Praise School Coming to Shreveport,"Story by Elizabeth Grams and Sean Connolly. Pictures by Greg Walters.  Our work in Allendale is poised to take a big leap forward as plans advance to open an elementary school. Craig Lent announced the plans at the Leaders' Conference for Men in South Bend on Friday evening March 13. The school will be called Praise Academy at Lakeside: a People of Praise School. It will launch this fall for children in prekindergarten kindergarten and first grade and eventually expand up to the eighth grade. The ""at Lakeside"" portion of the school's name reflects a mission to serve children who live within a quarter-mile of our cluster of homes in Allendale an area known locally as ""Lakeside."" ""This is a very exciting move of the whole People of Praise into a new educational arena"" Craig said. Three community members living in Allendale have accepted positions with the new school. The principal will be Joan Pingel a special-education teacher with 20 years of experience and the winner of two teacher of the year awards (from Trinity School at Greenlawn and Sun City School in Bossier City Louisiana). Colleen Murray a math and science teacher will be the assistant principal and dean of girls while Kevin McShane a missionary with a degree in computer science has agreed to become the business manager and dean of boys. ""Our goal for the school is to raise strong Christian young men and women who will build the kingdom of God"" Joan says. ""We want to start young with four-year-olds and go from there."" The school will open at 1434 Yale Avenue a 2400-square-foot residence built by Action volunteers in 2006. Nathan Barrett the team leader and the longest-serving community member there says that the idea for the school dates back to at least 2006 when the local CIM team agreed to send Joan to get a master's degree in school supervision. More focused planning began in 2012 when Joan and Nano Farabaugh (South Bend) began drafting a curriculum. With Debbie Mixell (South Bend) they visited several Christian schools to garner ideas: the West Dallas Community School The Wilberforce School in Princeton New Jersey The Oaks Academy in Indianapolis and Gardere Community Christian School in Baton Rouge Louisiana. ""We want to get to know each child individually to respect them to serve them and to delight in introducing them to all aspects of what is good true and beautiful"" Nano says. The curriculum will include the usual subjects of reading writing math art music etc. Other topics taught will include Scripture memorization Bible reading and habits such as right speech and forgiveness and reconciliation. In the spring of 2014  the community received an anonymous $111000 grant to make preparations for the school. The Christians in Mission team in Allendale began a community consultation to discern whether God was calling them to make the school part of their long-term neighborhood work. After unanimously agreeing to proceed the team began to consult with their neighbors. They knocked on close to 300 doors and spoke with residents of 223 homes.  They found that 97 percent of the neighbors they spoke to expressed support for the idea of the school. Seventy-one percent specifically emphasized that they wanted it to be a neighborhood school. Many neighbors spoke about the importance of having prayer in the school. ""The school would be a good idea for the neighborhood"" said Rosie Priest a Lakeside resident and mother of four children. ""Real prayer and reading the Bible every day-that would be awesome. That's the way I was raised. My mom and dad taught me about the Father and Jesus. We didn't have much but they believed in prayer. If we teach the kids that they will do that."" The school has formed a board of trustees which includes Paul DeCelles (chair) Nano Paul Kane (South Bend) Debbie and Joan. Sarah Loughran (South Bend) has been working as an administrative assistant for the project since the fall of 2014. Members of the Allendale CIM team and members of the Shreveport branch are already volunteering help with various needs: preparing breakfast and lunch providing transportation janitorial work tutoring etc. Tuition and operating expenses for the school will be subsidized by outside donors with local families paying what they can afford. Anne Osterhouse (South Bend) the communications director will be providing information about how community members can participate.""The Lakeside school project is a faith undertaking"" says Paul DeCelles ""a work which is possible because of the community's experience educating children at Trinity Schools since 1981 and the faithful presence of brothers and sisters laboring in Allendale since 2002. Please join us in prayer during these crucial next few months before the opening.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4469
4453,Jan. 21 2015 4:42 p.m.,With April Conference Action Kicking into High Gear,Story by Sean Connolly and Chris Meehan. Photos by Karen Xenakis and Mary Couch. A communitywide Action conference will be held in South Bend from April 8 to 11. The conference is for high school students in grades 9 through 12 and all interested adults. “We’re aiming to set free more of the energy creativity and talent that we have in Action so that we can do more work in the Mississippi Valley” says Mike Zusi Action’s program coordinator. The conference will build on the momentum from the Action conference three years ago but with a twist. Instead of training exercises attendees will have chances to get to work planning and practicing camp activities for this summer writing songs and producing videos for use in the camps in Allendale and Indianapolis (according to preliminary plans). The conference will also include work groups news updates door-to-door canvassing praise and worship as well as time for sports and other fun.  At the 2012 conference attendees learned construction skills went door to door in nearby neighborhoods to pray with neighbors played sports together and heard updates on our work in the new starts. They also learned a new song by Jared Gonzalez  “Revive This Land” and later worked on a collaborative music video for the song that has been viewed close to 19000 times on YouTube. The Action coaching program also began at the conference. The program provides Action high school students the opportunity to meet regularly with someone-a coach involved in the community’s mission work. Ben Mysliwiec now a missionary in Evansville helped plan the 2012 conference as a high school sophomore from northern Virginia. “The conference gave us a new fire new confidence and joy.” “It motivated us to work together and accomplish things” added Genna Olson (South Bend) a high-school senior who attended the 2012 conference. She has worked on several action trips and plans to attend this year’s conference.“We ask everyone to pray for the success of the 2015 conference” says Catherine Bulger the conference administrator who adds that she is planning for 200 attendees.  She expects to have a registration form ready tomorrow. “We would also be very grateful for donations to help defray expenses so that many people are able to attend the conference. You can contact me for more details.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4453
4443,Jan. 10 2015 11:23 a.m.,In Yakima Bringing Men to Men's Group,"Mike Hays Jeremiah Orthmann and Gerry Orthmann met with Ron Rice to plan their men's group outreach. Story by Chris Meehan and Elizabeth Grams. Photo by Ron Rice. The men of the Yakima branch are proclaiming the Gospel in a new way to men in their city. Their method is simple: bring them to men's group. Once each month the men in Gerry Orthmann's men's group which also includes Mike Hays Ron Rice and Jeremiah Orthmann invite other men to join them for brotherhood discussion and prayer. They've been holding these meetings since the spring of 2014. Typically six or eight guests attend each month and several have started coming regularly. ""A couple of years ago I thought the Lord was prompting me to do something new with my men's group"" recalls Gerry. ""I talked to the guys about what I'd been thinking. Over the years we had invited men to different kinds of activities and events but we could never really get any traction with those efforts."" The group prayed and talked for several months before settling on the idea of an open men's meeting-an idea that Gerry says a friend in Servant Branch Colin LaVergne passed on to him. They scheduled their first meeting last May. ""We had invited several guys to join us--neighbors co­workers and guys from our churches"" says Gerry. ""We weren't really sure how many men would show up but by 7:00 p.m. we had 10 guys sitting in my living room wondering what was about to happen. I talked very briefly about who we are as People of Praise and about how our men's group is an important way for us to share life and build friendships as Christian men."" Then Gerry showed a YouTube video of a skit with two men acting out a conversation between Jesus and Peter. ""After the video I led a discussion about Peter being a regular guy like us and having a very personal relationship with Jesus. We had a great conversation about growing in our relationship with the Lord. As they left some said they really liked it and asked when they could do it again."" In June 12 men came to grill bratwursts on Gerry's porch. At the gathering in July Gerry gave a short talk on being a Christian man followed by a discussion. The next month the men gathered in a local restaurant. Some of the guests had expressed interest in growing in their friendship with the Lord so the group talked about how to get started with daily prayer and Scripture reading. Since the summer the men’s group has continued to plan together for each open meeting according to the needs of their guests. Often the meeting includes a short explanation about the People of Praise (if there’s a new guest) a short talk discussion sharings intercessory prayer and always food. When inviting guests Mike says ""We let them know that it's the People of Praise that sponsors this. We tell them that we're an ecumenical community so they know where we're coming from."" They do this ahead of time so the guest can ""hit the ground running"" as Gerry puts it when he shows up at the meeting. The group has agreed that if a brother issues an invitation he is responsible for reminding that man offering him a ride and perhaps following up with an invitation to breakfast or a Lord's Day opening. ""We find that men are yearning for this kind of thing"" says Jeremiah. The meeting ""enriches their faith and appeals to them."" He adds that the meetings have also strengthened their regular men's group meetings which continue as usual the rest of the month and been good for him personally. ""Being there gives me a jumpstart! It gives me the feeling of a larger brotherhood. It keeps us fresh and optimistic."" Gerry says ""We tell these men that we're just regular guys who love God who want to live our lives as Christian men and want to share our lives with other men. That seems to make a lot of sense to them. It's been awesome to see the Lord working on these guys. We put in the effort and clearly the Lord is right in the middle of it.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4443
4129,Dec. 15 2014 4:24 p.m.,Collecting Coats for Refugees and the Homeless,The girls of the seventh eighth and ninth grade girls' youth group. Story by Chris Meehan and Elizabeth Grams. Photo by Andrea Kane. South Bend branch members collected winter coats hats gloves and scarves this November. They sent 925 pounds of coats to Ukrainian refugees and 15 bags of hats gloves and scarves to a local homeless center. Coats for Ukraine Beth Preuss was at a 25th wedding anniversary party for Gus and Karen Zuehlke when she first heard about the need for winter coats in Ukraine. Mike a former missionary with ties to Christian aid agencies in Ukraine who asked that his real name not be used planned to send a shipment of coats to help the refugees fleeing the conflict in the South and Eastern parts of the country. According to a recent UN report close to one million Ukrainians have sought asylum either within Ukraine in Russia or in other neighboring states. Many fled their homes last summer expecting to leave for only a short time but the continuing conflict has left them with few options. “Most of the refugees have food to eat and a roof over their heads” Mike says. “But the refugees lack warm clothes to survive the cold climate.” With only 13 days to go until the shipment of clothing left the U.S. Beth sprang into action. She contacted the pastor of her church Christ the King and spoke with John Lee the head of Trinity School at Greenlawn about collecting coats in their locations. Both agreed. Her husband Rich volunteered to organize the drive at his workplace. The South Bend branch also ran a notice about the collection in the branch bulletin. Trinity’s Student Life Committee decided to make the drive part of their annual spirit competition between classes which led to widespread student participation. “I was impressed by the high quality of the coats” says Beth who sorted and folded many of them with her daughters before bringing them to Mike. “Some were clearly new.” All in all Mike filled 19 large boxes with coats from Beth’s three sources and from other South Bend branch members. The total came to 925 pounds which included 239 jackets 152 sweaters 29 coats 53 pairs of boots 58 pants 14 vests 66 hats 61 scarves 32 pairs of gloves and 24 pairs of socks. Several families donated money to help with shipping the coats while a few more families held a bake sale to raise funds for the shipping. Beth says “The Holy Spirit was moving in the hearts of all these people in our local area to have compassion on the refugees. I got to see the Lord at work in his people and I was tremendously moved by it all. ” The boxes will reach their destinations in Ukraine in time for the Ukrainian Orthodox Christmas which is celebrated on January 7. Two organizations Hope to People in the city of Rivne and Light in the East in Kiev will distribute the supplies to refugee families they support and to other Ukrainian Christian organizations involved in relief work. “I am very grateful for the overwhelming response” Mike wrote to the South Bend branch.  Hats for the Homeless Last year the girls in the seventh eighth and ninth grade youth group collected blankets for the residents of South Bend’s Center for the Homeless.  “This year the center’s executive director was happy to come speak to us personally about the need for other winter clothing” explains Andrea Kane who leads the group.  “He even brought a guest resident along who spoke about her personal experience of homelessness and of getting back on her feet.” The girls spread the word about the need for hats scarves and mittens among branch members and they went door to door in the Kanes’ neighborhood asking for donations. They also made 55 fleece hats and scarves. “All in all we sent 15 large bags and boxes to the homeless center” says Andrea. “I feel very grateful for my own coats and my warm clothes” adds Christin Preuss a seventh grader. “Just thinking about the people who don't have those things I want to help them as much as possible. I thought this was a great way to help and I felt like the Holy Spirit was in this.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4129
4048,Dec. 3 2014 5:14 p.m.,Celebrating Thanksgiving Around the Community,A full table at John and Katherine Brophy’s home in Colorado Springs.  By Anne Osterhouse and Elizabeth Grams. Photos by Laura Kane Evan Lent Abby Earhart Stephen Buch Liz Cole and Emily Hagens. Community members in the US gathered together last week to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday. They opened their doors to relatives fellow community members travelers and friends. Here are a few examples:EvansvilleIn Evansville preparations began on Wednesday as missionary sisters cooked up a storm in the kitchen along with several women and girls from the neighborhood. “Rather than doing a potluck we asked people to bring their own ingredients and then we cooked together” says Chris Vieck. They made nine pies—six pumpkin and three pecan—as well as 25 mini-pecan pies  and two 9x13 pans of a strawberry dessert with a pretzel crust. At 7:30 on Thursday morning missionaries John Earhart and Nick Holovaty began deep-frying six turkeys one by one in the backyard. Community sisters peeled cut boiled and mashed 50 pounds of potatoes. The food preparation made use of ovens and refrigerators in five different houses of community members. At 1:00 p.m. 39 people gathered for prayer before splitting into two houses to eat. Attendees included 14 of the missionaries Casey and Carrie Johnson’s family twelve neighbors Claire and Anne Raway (Indianapolis) Chris Geriann and Mary Raway and Elizabeth Pease (Servant Branch) and Nick Raway Joe Bulger and David Zimmel (Allendale). After dinner the group sang old Gospel hymns and new praise songs of their own. “I really felt close to the Lord in giving thanks together as a community on Thanksgiving” says Carrie Johnson. “We had all put in the work and experienced the joy of putting on the meal. It was a big highlight in our community life.” AppletonIn Appleton Stephen and Jane Buch have been hosting Thanksgiving dinner for around 20 years keeping an eye out for branch members with no family nearby. This year’s group included Michael and Ruth Schmelzer Michael’s mother Viola Barb Oestreich David Sier (whose wife Joan was traveling) Jane’s sister and brother-in-law and Jane’s four-year-old grandnephew Sawyer. Dessert included a pumpkin pie made with pumpkin Jane had canned and was followed by games including Sheepshead a popular card game in Wisconsin. (Michael’s mother Viola won as usual.) “Just getting together is fun” Michael says. “Plus it’s fun to go out to eat and eating out at a brother and sister’s house is better than at a restaurant.” Colorado SpringsIn 2008 John and Katherine Brophy invited Bren and Karen Triplett’s family (all Colorado Springs) for Thanksgiving since neither the Brophys nor the Tripletts had family in the area. The two families have gathered at the Brophys’ every year since then. This year John’s parents Tom and Jackie Brophy (Tampa) also came along with John and Maria Elliot their daughter Kathryn (all northern Virginia) and their daughter Jane who teaches at Thomas MacLaren School. Branch members Mark Elio Jon Grams and Laura Kane MacLaren teacher Josh Kelly and a friend of John Brophy who is new to the area also joined them. “Every year it’s more relaxed” says Bren. “Josh and I ended up doing the dishes and putting them away which to me means that Katherine is so comfortable with us doing it that it’s like we’re really a family of families.” “John and Katherine have a way of finding a way to fill their house!” adds Mark. “It was a really joyful gathering one of my best Thanksgivings ever.” Vancouver-PortlandIn Vancouver-Portland a group of families has been gathering for a Thanksgiving meal since 2007. Over time the group has grown so this year they held the gathering at the branch’s community center in Vancouver. They had 54 attendees including members of the Brotherhood relatives college students and a family whose children attend Trinity Academy as well as a Trinity Academy faculty member and two of her siblings. (A young man who was actually looking for another gathering wandered in and stayed for about half an hour.) The guests included many transplants to the area from other parts of the US as well as from Mexico Lebanon Ethiopia and Jamaica. The food included traditional fare along with ethnic dishes from around the world. Ramona Castro who is originally from Mexico brought homemade guacamole and salsa. Suad Sbait from Lebanon brought a cauliflower dish broiled with Indian spices. Yodit Derese brought an Ethiopian dish. An open mic was the source of some hearty Thanksgiving-themed laughs. Pat Clark told a variety of jokes (How come the pilgrims had trouble holding up their pants? Because their buckles were on their hats!). Martha Olson and Joanna Robinson collaborated on a Thanksgiving rap. After dinner the children played a game with a large turkey balloon. One person held the balloon while a child was blindfolded and armed with a nerf gun. The turkey roved around the room “gobbling” while the child tried to shoot it. Peter and Stephen Kabele and Carlos Castro made the game more interesting by setting up obstacles. “My family are all in Lebanon” says Suad who attended the gathering for the first time this year with her daughter Jadwa. “We felt welcomed. It is nice to have brothers and sisters nephews and nieces here in the community.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4048

3995,Nov. 17 2014 2:25 p.m.,Video Broadcasts Bring Community to the Homebound,Daniel Laust films at a recent branch gathering. Story by Chris Meehan. Photo by Bob Cunningham.Servant Branch has begun live video broadcasts of their branch meetings that members can watch on the Internet. The broadcasts which are only available to Servant branch members are a new way for brothers and sisters who can’t attend the meeting because of illness old age travel etc. to participate in the life of their branch. “We wanted to help absent branch members be more united in heart and mind with those in the meeting room” explains principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler. The project is just four months old but reports from branch members indicate that it has already begun to fulfill its purpose. Pat Walsh is a long time branch member who suffers from post-polio symptoms and hasn’t been able to attend meetings for about 10 years. In the past she listened to the meeting at least a few days later on CD but now she watches it live and can talk about it afterward with her housemate Penny Arndt. “The broadcasts show my brothers and sisters as they sing and pray and that helps me feel more a part of what’s going on and join in” she says. Shane and Diane Drefcinski live in Platteville Wisconsin about 250 miles from the Twin Cities. They’ve been on assignment there for over a decade so Shane can teach philosophy at the Platteville campus of the University of Wisconsin. “It was often difficult to corral all six of our kids together to listen to an audio recording” Diane says “but now on Sunday afternoons I can call out ‘The community meeting’s on’ and they’ll gather around to watch and listen.” They look for their friends relatives and their sister Angela in particular. “We feel more connected and we are grateful to have this option now.” Nancy Caneff traveled from the Twin Cities to Florida recently to care for her 91-year-old mother. “On a day when my husband Tom gave a talk my mother and I were able to watch as he gave it. It was wonderful to recognize faces and voices; I felt present with the branch. As I sat on the side of Mom’s bed we sang along with some of the older charismatic songs she remembered.” The idea for the broadcasts came about six years ago when a group of branch members began meeting to talk about how to help aging community members. Last year the branch’s CD duplicator broke and Joel saw an opportunity. He spoke to the branch coordinators and they agreed to study how many people could benefit from live video broadcasts. After the study the numbers looked sufficient to justify the expense so Joel asked Tom Bowar to begin researching equipment. Eventually on Tom’s recommendation the branch purchased two video cameras along with a tripod and a computer to run the system. Now Tom leads a team of five that includes Ken Larsen Dan Laust Elizabeth Pease and John Gruber. A typical community meeting requires a three-person crew including two camera operators and someone to manage the computer where the feeds are mixed together and processed for Internet viewing. Two cameras on tripods are positioned at the back of the auditorium facing the stage. A third camera controlled by a remote will be used starting in December. It will be mounted at the front of the room where it can pick up shots of branch members. John a senior at Trinity River Ridge says that he enjoys working on the crew. “Every week there’s something different to deal with and learn about. People who are watching will often text Tom directly if there’s a glitch. We’re constantly changing and improving.” The glitches have been there Tom admits but branch members say the broadcasts have been getting better with each meeting. “We’re still learning and we want the production to be high-quality.” After the meetings the video recordings are archived and placed on a private page on the website Vimeo.com where branch members can access them for about three weeks. Gary Luzar lives 42 miles from River Ridge and has back problems that have kept him from recent meetings. He says: “It’s cool that the meetings are accessible to people in my situation.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3995

3968,Oct. 27 2014 12:26 p.m.,Buffalo Branch Reaches out to Black Rock Neighborhood,Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan (Branch Relations) spoke on healing at the October 23 prayer meeting in Black Rock. Story by Chris Meehan. Photo by Bob Scott.  Buffalo branch’s outreach in Black Rock a lower-income multicultural neighborhood northwest of downtown is approaching its first anniversary. The outreach now includes weekly Thursday night prayer meetings with one a month serving as a healing meeting and for the last six weeks a men’s group that two neighborhood men participate in. “This is our response to the Lord's call to us to find those people with whom he wants to share his Holy Spirit” says principal branch coordinator Tom Shriver. “We wanted to find a way to expand our surface area and meet more people. We're a smaller older branch but I'm always impressed at how our members are wide open to serving God in any way possible.” Rev. Richard Jedrzejewski the pastor of Church of the Assumption a Catholic parish in Black Rock classifies the area as inner-city. He grew up in the neighborhood and has seen it change from a middle class area for stable Christian families to a multiethnic and multireligious neighborhood with a wide variety of family situations. “It is economically depressed. We have many single-parent households” he says. “Black Rock has big challenges.” The prayer meetings began in November 2013 as branch members considered together what work the Lord might be calling the branch to take on. Tom points to a men’s retreat in 2012 as the catalyst during which Mission Program coordinator Nick Holovaty told stories of the community’s mission work: “Nick sparked a hunger in us to step outside our comfort zone and do more for the Lord.” “In January of 2013 Tom gave a challenging talk about how to get serious about answering the Lord’s call to us to engage in outreach” recalls Martha Delaney. Afterward the branch began exploring possible outreaches talking with a number of Buffalo pastors and church leaders. “At some point a friend of the branch suggested we talk to the pastor of Church of the Assumption in Black Rock” recalls Bud Northway who led the branch discernment effort and now leads the outreach in Black Rock. “As we talked with Father Richard it became clear to us that he had a heart for all the residents of Black Rock. He spoke frankly about his concerns for their spiritual health. He wanted them to have a personal relationship with the Lord. When I floated the idea that the People of Praise could run a prayer meeting in the area—maybe in his church—he was very enthusiastic and supportive.” Father Richard offered a room in the church for the prayer meeting funds to finance advertising and his full support of the branch’s ecumenical approach. About 20 members of the branch began taking turns coming to Black Rock every week to hold a prayer meeting. They promoted it primarily by word of mouth and through a stream of stories in the neighborhood newspaper. A children’s choir including many neighborhood children sang for their annual Lessons and Carols program. During the branch men’s retreat this past September retreat leaders Charlie Fraga and Luke Glover (Portland) went with the men onto the streets where they all introduced themselves to neighbors and offered to pray with them. Bill Toth a 73-year-old widower who has lived in Black Rock his whole life says that he has been neighbors with Jim Benson for 20 years but it wasn't until they joined the prayer meeting and then the men's group that they became good friends. Bill says he enjoyed walking the streets with branch members “bringing the good news of God's love to Black Rock residents taking back the neighborhood from the Enemy and introducing the People of Praise to all the beauty in Black Rock.” Last Saturday branch members came to a soup kitchen run by Church of the Assumption where they prayed with the guests. The branch hopes to start a women’s group in the area soon. They have started conversations with pastors of other neighborhood churches about more ways to work together. Father Richard expresses his gratitude for the People of Praise’s presence in the neighborhood. “That they're not afraid to walk the streets on Saturday afternoon is big. Despite all the programs that exist to help people it’s one-on-one relationships that make a long-term difference and that's what they’re trying to do. Doing that takes a lot of people and a lot of time to accomplish.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3968
3940,Oct. 3 2014 4:15 p.m.,In Portland Trinity Academy Grows into New Building,"Trinity Academy started its fourth academic year in a new location in north Portland.Story by Chris Meehan. Photos by Ekko Designs and Beth Kabele.Trinity Academy in Portland has moved into a larger building after almost tripling in size since last year. The school now in its fourth year of operation has 45 students in the sixth through twelfth grades up from 16 students in 2013-14. Twelve of these students are the children of community members while the remaining 33 come from non-community families.The growth has beaten the Vancouver/Portland branch's expectations. ""We had projected that it would take 10 years to reach an enrollment of 30 students"" says Charlie Fraga who heads the branch and chairs the school's board. ""We're very happy about the growth and also extremely grateful to our good friend Haddish Tarekegn a local Christian businessman who made it possible for us to have a building with enough room for all of the students.  Teresa Lourdes and Jack in ninth-grade Humane LettersHaddish first heard about the young school and its need for space after a child's birthday party at Pat and Jo Clark's home. He offered to renovate a three-story 10000 square-foot building he owns in north Portland in the same section of town that the branch has targeted for their city-building efforts.Haddish and his wife Rahel Legese both native-born Ethiopians send their two young daughters to Holy Redeemer School where several families in the branch also send their children. Haddish is the owner of Pristine Cleaning a company which has a number of stores offices and hotels in the Portland area as clients. He also invests in local property.The renovation took over a year and included the creation of numerous classrooms a faculty room open space for morning prayer and assemblies a basketball court a courtyard where students can eat lunch during warmer months a new exterior facade and a major structural upgrade to reinforce the building against earthquakes.Trinity Academy now occupies the top story and part of the second story which also houses Direct Development a marketing company Charlie runs and the Vancouver/Portland branch office. The offices can eventually move down to the first story to accommodate any future growth of the school. The school has signed a five-year lease.Head of school Jo Clark says branch members have been crucial to the school's strong start. ""In addition to prayers excitement enthusiasm and encouragement they have provided service-helping us move into our new building-and ongoing volunteer support. They have filled the seats at school events and they serve on the school's advisory council.""She notes that the five seniors at the school are ""the kind of senior class any school would cherish."" All five of these student pioneers-four of them children of community members-have attended the school since its first year: Christian Barajas Carlos Castro Peter Kabele Stephen Kabele and Naomi Shreves. ""The seniors are stalwart leaders"" says Jo ""a delight to teach and great role models for the younger students.""  The sixth-graders enjoy their Public Performance class taught by Dr. Francie Longshore.Some of the growth in enrollment occurred because Trinity Academy added a sixth grade this year. This was in response to parents' requests since many local grade schools stop at fifth grade. Word of mouth accomplished the rest and Eric Shreves chair of the advisory council credits branch members and current students' parents with getting the word out. ""The result is a diverse student body with many denominations and ethnic groups represented"" he says.Jo says the faculty has played a big role as well. ""I tell prospective parents that our teachers are very knowledgeable wise and kind. This fall we have a great crop of new teachers who bring a lot of enthusiasm to the school and are proving to be exceptionally good at drawing out a sense of wonder in our students."" Among the new teachers is Sam Mertz a graduate of Trinity at River Ridge who recently completed his history degree at Holy Cross College in South Bend. Martha Olson a Trinity School at River Ridge grad teaches part-time. The school has four full-time and 12 part-time teachers including six community members.As a member of the admissions committee Charlie meets with most prospective students and their families. ""I'm impressed with how sincere these parents are about raising their children in the best possible Christian and academic environment. They sense that Trinity Academy is what they've been searching for and several have told me that they have never seen their child so happy at school before. A lot of that is due to Jo Clark who has worked indefatigably doing whatever it takes to get this school off the ground. She has an obvious love for the school and for the students themselves.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3940
3938,Oct. 3 2014 3:01 p.m.,Update on Chikungunya in Jamaica,"The chikungunya outbreak in Jamaica has reached epidemic levels according to the country's health ministry. Branch leader Locksley Robinson says that the virus has begun affecting the branch. Seventeen of the branch’s 54 adults and children have experienced chikungunya-like symptoms. As of October 2 ten have recovered and seven were still suffering. Locksley says""We thank the community for your concern and especially for your prayers. The Lord is with us and we continue to reach out and care for one another.""For more information see our previous news blast.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3938
3928,Sept. 26 2014 10:47 a.m.,Chikungunya Virus Hits Grenada and the Caribbean,Story by Chris Meehan. A mosquito-borne virus called chikungunya is spreading rapidly throughout the Caribbean with more than 700000 suspected cases in the region according to the Pan American Health Organization. In a newspaper report Grenada’s prime minister said the virus has hit that island nation very hard. Grenada branch leader Dominic Jeremiah says that many members have experienced the painful flu-like symptoms that come with chikungunya. “Just about every household in the community has had at least one or two people infected by the virus at various times.” Because mosquitoes can easily spread the virus from one person to the next the branch has had to temporarily suspend its community meetings along with men’s and women’s groups. The branch in Kingston Jamaica appears to have escaped infection so far although branch leader Locksley Robinson explains that it's difficult to tell who has contracted chikungunya. “This disease has struck Jamaica at the beginning of our rainy season when colds and the flu are common anyway. The symptoms can be similar at points so it's hard to tell who has it and who doesn't. The main treatment is a pain reliever Panadol which is available over the counter so most people treat themselves and it doesn't get reported.” Chikungunya causes severe joint pain and fever and typically involves muscle aches headaches joint swelling and rashes. There is no cure and in some cases the disease can be fatal. According to a report in the Grenada Informer a weekly newspaper 87% of victims recover after two weeks but face the threat of severe arthritic pain resurfacing weeks later and lingering for years. Infants and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. The virus is spread by mosquitoes not by direct human-to-human contact. Dominic reports that despite the virus public and private establishments in Grenada like schools and offices are running mostly as normal. “Some of these places cannot function at optimal productivity levels because of the absence of workers” he says adding that many teachers and students at Presentation Brothers College where he is principal had to be sent home when they exhibited symptoms of the virus. “The biggest lesson for us under these circumstances is to try to stay in touch with each other” says Dominic. “We must ensure that the the elderly the pregnant and little children receive special protection. At the same time we are trying to ensure that everyone is calm hopeful and doing all that they need to do to be healed as quickly as possible. We are certainly learning how to be concerned for each other and how to care for each other.” Locksley acknowledges that the epidemic might be still its early stages. “We’ll just have to wait and see. In the meantime we’ll be looking out for each other.” Jim Bulger (Servant Branch) who regularly visits Grenada on behalf of the People of Praise branch relations council has asked the whole community for prayer. Kevin Ranaghan head of the council adds “We are investigating the situation to see how we might be able to help our brothers and sisters and their families in this medical emergency.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3928

3868,Sept. 15 2014 9:34 a.m.,Marriage in Christ Outreach Poised to Grow Nationwide,Bob and Christine Brickweg perform in a new video series that is part of the Marriage in Christ seminar. Story by Chris Meehan. Photo courtesy of Greenlawn Films. Marriage in Christ an outreach sponsored by Servant Branch conducted a training institute for couples from across the community from September 5 to 7. Sixteen couples from 10 community branches traveled to the Twin Cities to attend the three-day institute held at the River Ridge branch center. Its goal was to expand the Marriage in Christ (MIC) seminar nationwide by training the couples so they can put on seminars in their local areas. “Our goal with MIC is to share some of the wisdom God has given us in the community about marriage” says principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler who serves on the MIC executive committee with Bob Brickweg and Bill Wacker. “We want to help many more couples acquire the power of the Holy Spirit renew their relationships with God and strengthen their friendships with each other.” The seminars are aimed at the general public but community couples can also benefit from attending Joel says. They are ecumenical in their content and approach. The seminar consists of five weekly sessions of talks and discussions usually hosted by local churches. Topics covered include strengthening the couple’s relationship with God and with each other sin as an obstacle to a loving marriage the Holy Spirit and practical areas such as sexuality forgiveness and family life. Couples perform homework between the sessions taking 20 minutes each day to pray to grow in friendship through conversation and to perform small acts of love and service for each other. Couples pay around $100 to attend the seminar which includes manuals they can use for follow-up. The institute in September also featured the debut of a new series of five videos produced by Greenlawn Films in South Bend. The videos rely on short dramas and personal stories to cover the basic teaching points of the seminar and they will replace the talks in the future. Greenlawn Films spent a year developing the videos writing scripts holding auditions and rehearsals then filming and editing. Servant Branch couples Bob and Christine Brickweg and Tom and Nancy Caneff are the presenters. South Bend branch members Joe Gleason and Elizabeth Grams directed the episodes and Sean Connolly was the producer. “The quality of the videos is nothing short of spectacular” said Mike Freeman (Vancouver-Portland) who attended the institute with his wife Kathy. “They are tangible and beautiful expressions of the fruit of Christianity in marriage.” At the institute couples attended a condensed version of the seminar and learned the ins and outs of putting it on successfully. They received a kit with the materials needed to host seminars including the videos and manuals. “It was exciting to see something concrete that we can offer to the wider world” said Natalia Bendele (Shreveport) who also attended the institute. Bill Wacker who directs the MIC outreach says that the idea originated in 2010 after Servant Branch members heard prophetic words about outreach. Bill has had a longtime interest in the Bible’s teaching on marriage and he and Joel began talking about starting a marriage outreach. Soon Bill’s wife Adella joined the discussion along with Bob and Christine Tom and Nancy Sam and Mary Claassen Chris and Peggy Dietzen Dave and Peg Louiselle George Wolney and Jan Sweere. “We did a lot of experimentation and had many conversations among ourselves and with the community’s board of governors before we came up with what we have now. Once we got going we also got feedback from participants” Bill says. Since 2011 Servant Branch members have put on more than 20 MIC seminars in area churches and at River Ridge. Three hundred couples have attended. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis has welcomed MIC to several of its parishes and a diocese in Iowa is interested in spreading the seminar in their area. Over the course of the last nine months the MIC team has been gearing up to spread the seminar more widely. They hired one:ten communications to redesign their web site and worked with Greenlawn Films to produce the video series. They overhauled their manual to make it easier for couples to use and they hired Laura Brickweg in Servant Branch to work as an administrator. They have a seminar scheduled soon at St. John Neumann Church in Eagan MN and they are planning to hold another training institute from November 14 to 16.

Nearly 400 people from ten locations of the People of Praise as well as guests from Ohio California and China came together in Cannon Falls Minnesota early this August for Servant Camp. “God was very present to all of us the whole time” says camp director Pat Ficker. First-time camper Elizabeth Maunu a ninth-grade guest from Minnesota agrees: “At Servant Camp I could feel the Spirit of the Lord.” Around 100 adults joined the children at camp for a jam-packed week of games crafts skits flag ceremonies meals teachings sharings campfires canoes rope courses healings dancing rock wall climbing songs serious and silly swimming prophecies and prayer with a wealth of good weather and notably fewer mosquitoes than in previous years. “The activities were really fun--and I enjoyed making new friends” says camper Owen Linczer a seventh-grader from South Bend. Muncie ninth-grader Elizabeth Coleman also enjoyed meeting people of other ages and from other locations. She had ample opportunity: campers and staff came from Colorado Springs Corvallis Evansville Indianapolis northern Virginia Portland Rockford Saskatoon South Bend and the Twin Cities. Children in first and second grades attended a day camp while all older children camped in tents and cabins. Campers in the eighth ninth and tenth grades listened to talks and discussed them in the mornings then had group activities (often off site adventures such as kayaking in a nearby river) in the afternoon. Campers in the eleventh and twelfth grades participated in the morning formation sessions then served as junior counselors for younger children in the afternoon. Four People of Praise missionaries gave a presentation describing their life and work in Mission to the older campers on Thursday morning. “I just really enjoyed hearing the miracles that they had experienced or stories of God blessing people with peace” says Sean Pingel an eighth-grader from South Bend. “I got a desire to go if I feel like God is telling me to say something or do something to trust him and go do it.” Missionaries taught the whole camp several new songs they had written. “My favorite new song was Mary Timler’s ‘Shout It Out’” says Maggie Kocon 10 from Servant Branch. Dominic Bulger and several other campers from Servant Branch helped to teach “Rejoice” a new song of their own. “It’s a huge operation but it runs like a well-oiled machine” notes Kate Olson a first-time Servant Camp counselor from the South Bend branch which sent up a contingent of 66 children. Planning is already underway for next year’s camp. “It takes about a year to organize a camp like this” veteran staff member Jeanne Oberg points out. “We have camp on the brain for most of the year!” Pat Ficker adds “We always do our best to help children encounter the Lord and his Holy Spirit amid the fun and friendship and this year the Lord outdid himself in blessing that.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3829
3809,Aug. 23 2014 12:45 p.m.,Allendale Camp Yields Many Holy Spirit Sightings,Story by Chris Meehan. Photos by Sarah Loughran. This year’s Allendale camp ran for six weeks and consistently drew at least 45 children from the local area. The campers who ranged in age from 3 to 18 were divided into seven groups. They participated in activities like fishing playing basketball building bug boxes making model volcanoes baking pizza and cookies and painting the sidewalk. Kevin McShane (Mission Division Allendale) led the camp with plenty of help from a staff of Action summer interns Action team members and members of Christians in Mission. The camp yielded many stories about how the Holy Spirit worked in the lives of neighborhood residents both young and old as well as in the lives of the staff. One day several staff members gathered together to pray over Xavier a 15-year-old camper who had asked to receive the Holy Spirit. Afterward Xavier said he thought that God wanted to tell him something in two days. Two days later the Lord spoke an encouraging word to him and later he felt prompted to share the same word with a woman he ran into by chance. She broke into tears and described her difficulties. They were both so built up by what happened that now Xavier asks the Lord for prophecies every day just so he can share God’s word with his neighbors. Xavier said his friendships with men in the People of Praise have helped him following the death of his mother. “The People of Praise has always been there for me” he says. “I’m so grateful. If it weren’t for them I wouldn’t be where I am today. I would have given up hope.”  Emily Wind (Servant Branch) who was in charge of all the girls recalled one day when a brother and sister age three and six came to camp. The boy accidentally spilled a container of beads all over the floor. “He looked afraid that he was about to be severely punished” says Emily “but his sister immediately said 'It's okay they won't yell at you. They're really nice here.’” This year’s camp featured more field trips than usual. Tom McNichol (northern Virginia) described a fishing expedition: “Cross Lake is not that far away but it’s outside the small section of Shreveport these nine- to twelve-year-old boys usually see. They had such joy on their faces as they reeled in those fish. One boy caught nine! Another boy waited patiently for a long time without catching anything and didn’t complain even when somebody took his worms. He persisted and finally caught three fish.” Kevin McShane described the time a thirteen-year-old boy misunderstood the schedule. He and an eight-year-old friend walked over a mile to Yale Avenue on a day when no camp was scheduled. They knocked on the door to the house where some of the missionary men live and were invited in for a glass of water. Then the older boy asked if he could show his friend the “cool” bunk beds the guys had built. The younger boy looked around at the close quarters and said he expected that the guys would be fighting all the time. Then the older boy who had attended camp for several years said “The missionaries don't fight. If you hit them in the face they would get up and turn their face so you could hit them on the other side!” Allendale Christians in Mission team members Pat and Edna Malone housed six people during each of the three Action trips and Pat was head of security which usually meant chasing away stray dogs or dealing with strangers. Edna maintained the finances for the Action summer and also made 94 loaves of banana bread and 12 dozen muffins for the children’s snack times. One day Edna took five girl campers age six to nine over to a friend’s house. Claudia is an older long-time resident of the neighborhood who was feeling discomfort caused by heart arrhythmia. Several days after Edna and the girls prayed with her Claudia said she was feeling better than she had in months! Working at the camp made a big impression on Joe Rolf a student at Holy Cross College in South Bend. Joe found out about the camp from his friend and veteran Allendale camp staffer Sam Mertz (Vancouver-Portland) who just graduated from Holy Cross. Joe led the group of nine- to twelve-year-old boys. He says the experience helped him make a connection with Pope Francis’s apostolic exhortation The Joy of the Gospel. “I have to admit Pope Francis writes beautifully about encountering Christ in people really drawing you into it but I discovered it’s hard work!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3809
3800,Aug. 11 2014 3:58 p.m.,First Trinity Member School To Open in Princeton NJ,Kerry Koller (front left) president of Trinity Schools and Howe Whitman (front right) head of school at The Wilberforce School signed a partnership agreement on August 6 at Trinity School at River Ridge. Trinity and Wilberforce faculty members on hand for faculty training joined them. Story by Sean Connolly. Photo by Jon Balsbaugh. A new high school will open its doors in Princeton New Jersey this fall thanks to a partnership between Trinity Schools and The Wilberforce School. The Wilberforce School (TWS) is an independent Christian school with 160 students. This year it is adding ninth and tenth grades to its previous pre-K through 8th grade offerings and the school expects to add 11th and 12th grades in coming years. Wilberforce high school students will follow Trinity’s curriculum in their math science and humanities courses and their teachers will receive ongoing training from Trinity master teachers. This makes the high school at Wilberforce the first of its type — a school that will license the Trinity curriculum and maintain an ongoing training relationship with Trinity’s teachers and administrative leaders. To reflect these close ties the school has a new designation Trinity Member School which it is already using in its marketing materials. Howe Whitman head of school at TWS and Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools Inc. signed a contract formalizing the partnership on August 6. “It has been a joy to work with everybody at Trinity” Howe says. “When Wilberforce leaders learned about Trinity’s approach it seemed like the natural conclusion to the education we are already offering to lower and middle school students. We wanted to be able to offer those students the same kind of challenging and deep education that Trinity high school students receive an education that honors God and focuses on the true the good and the beautiful.” “I am very pleased” Kerry adds. “This is a new way for Trinity Schools and for the People of Praise to fulfill our goal of educating as many students as we can in a true and integral Christian humanism. We have been very impressed by the academic excellence at Wilberforce and by their leaders’ commitment to a Christian vision for education.” The new partnership is the result of two years of prayer conversation and work on the part of Howe Karen Ristuccia (TWS academic dean) and other TWS leaders together with Kerry Andrew Zwerneman (head of school at Trinity School at Meadow View) Paul Kane (Trinity’s vice-president of finance) and members of the Trinity School board of trustees. Connections between TWS and Trinity Schools go back to at least 2002 when Paul and Howe got to know each other through Paul’s brother Leo. Coincidentally Karen began to hear about Trinity through her nephews Justin and Jonathan Young who both graduated from Trinity School at Meadow View in Virginia. She visited the campus in 2011 and later that year Howe and a team from TWS also visited with Andrew and others at Meadow View. In 2012 Howe and Kerry began to talk seriously about the partnership. Then in January of 2013 Andrew and two Meadow View students Ben Mysliwiec and Mollie Clement traveled to Princeton to speak about Trinity to a gathering of TWS parents. This fall former Meadow View teacher Katherine Krall who recently moved to Princeton will become the first ninth-grade Humane Letters teacher at TWS. Another connection came in 2012 when a team from the People of Praise communications office (Greenlawn Films) produced a marketing video for TWS. There are already many similarities between Wilberforce and Trinity. Both started small and both began holding their classes in church buildings. Both school cultures feature small classes daily morning prayer and close relationships between teachers and students. Both admit students from a variety of Christian denominations and both have reputations for academic excellence.  A group of Christian parents founded TWS in 2005 naming it in honor of a British abolitionist and Christian member of parliament William Wilberforce (1759-1833). Fifteen students are enrolled in the new high school and Howe expects the enrollment to grow. The high school has already attracted some graduating TWS eighth graders. Howe says the high school classes will start out with boys and girls together but they will transition to single-sex classes in the future. “I want it to be as much like a Trinity School as possible” he says. Kerry adds “We’ve been very successful in spreading our curriculum in the past but this partnership gives a new dimension to our work. We are very grateful to the Lord to be working with The Wilberforce School in this mutual endeavor.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3800

The overall coordinator picks from those three names and forwards his choice to the board of governors for confirmation.” Of John Craig said simply “He has done a terrific job” before his words were interrupted by prolonged applause and cheering. John was elected to serve on the board of governors in May. His six-year term begins on December 1. The branch will have a chance to honor John at a later date Craig said. Besides South Bend the other two of the community’s three largest branches will also see leadership changes in the next several months. Joel Kibler’s second term as principal branch coordinator of Servant Branch ends on February 8. Lek Kadeli’s second term as principal branch coordinator of the northern Virginia branch also ends on February 8. Principal branch coordinators cannot be appointed for three consecutive terms without a dispensation from the board of governors. “Please pray for Rich and Trice and the whole branch during this time of transition” Craig said.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3767
3716,July 18 2014 1:43 p.m.,Record-Setting Camp Wraps Up on the South Side,"South Side boys gather for camp on Karcher Street in Indianapolis. Story by Chris Meehan.  A summer camp for neighborhood children on the South Side of Indianapolis wrapped up on Friday July 18. The camp sponsored by the Christians in Mission team and staffed by visiting Action team members started strong with a record 67 local children on the first day. Overall approximately twice as many children participated as last year says Jared Gonzalez who headed the camp. Abe Olson head of the Christians in Mission team says the camp is “succeeding in its goals of helping children on the South Side relate as brothers and sisters teaching them about forgiveness and reconciliation right speech Jesus Scripture and how to have fun and play well with other children. We expect the camp to bear lasting fruit in our relationships with our neighbors in years to come.” Jared described a typical day for the boys. “We started with prayer reciting the Lord’s Prayer so the boys could memorize it. Then we went on to activities like constructing birdhouses growing herbs in Mason jars making percussion instruments and even running an experiment with a gushing volcano. There was always plenty of time for dodgeball basketball whiffleball and soccer with 20-minute breaks which meant stopping for snacks and some talk about forgiveness loving and honoring your parents how to pray and in particular how to pray for healing.”  Action team members and South Side girls. Ellen Putzier led the girls' part of camp and says she usually had the girls play games like freeze tag and Ships Across the Ocean. At crafts time they made marbled paper created mosaics from colored paper learned to paint in pointillist style and finger-knitted. They also took a field trip to a nearby church to see paintings and sculptures of Jesus. After hearing Ellen explain what was happening to Jesus in the artwork one girl exclaimed “Keep telling stories about Jesus!” Genevieve Kane 14 an Action team member from South Bend said making ice cream was her favorite camp activity. ""The neighborhood girls were very open and very good about asking for forgiveness and apologizing when they did something wrong."" Walt Seale said he could already see some of the fruit of the camp at a block party on July 11. “The girls from camp performed a praise dance and the boys did a drumline so that drew more kids and family members to the party. We had almost 150 people!” Ellen attributed some of this year’s growth to a couple of scheduling changes made by the planning team. During the camp’s first two years a number of the children were still in bed when camp staff came by to pick them up. Also the children were often confused about the camp schedule. “So we took action” explained Naomi Coney a member of the planning team. “We moved camp to the afternoons put it on a regular Monday-through-Friday schedule and made a plan to keep the camp going when Action teams weren’t available.”  Camp for the boys began with prayer each afternoon. Abe thanked all the members of Action for their hard work. “In order to make the camp work the Action staff gathered a team developed a curriculum and ran the activities. They are a bunch of heroes! Community members from the Indianapolis branch also helped out quite a bit as well as volunteers from the Muncie branch and Servant Branch.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3716

3406,March 4 2014 1:05 p.m.,Fr. Peter Smith Appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Portland,"by Sean Connolly  Fr. Peter SmithPope Francis has appointed Fr. Peter Smith (Vancouver-Portland) to be the auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland Oregon. The appointment was announced in Portland at 9:30 a.m. Pacific time on Tuesday March 4. Fr. Peter follows Bishop Kenneth Steiner who retired in 2011.Peter has been a member of the Brotherhood of the People of Praise since 1983. He has served the Archdiocese of Portland as the vicar general and moderator of the clergy since July 1 2013. His ordination as bishop is tentatively scheduled for April 29 2014.“Peter is a pastor who turns people’s minds and hearts to Jesus in his homilies” according to Joel Kibler who heads the Brotherhood and has been Peter’s friend for almost 30 years. “He prays with people for physical healing and he helps people to reconcile with the Lord. He has a great sense of humor and he is always dependable.”Peter says “I am humbled and grateful for the Holy Father's confidence in me. Please keep me in your prayers as I step in to this new role with all its responsibilities and challenges.  Pray especially for God the Father's blessing and protection.""Peter Smith was born in 1958 in Pietermaritzburg South Africa. He is the oldest of six children. At age 18 he served in the South African army before earning degrees in business and law from the University of Natal. In a biographical article he wrote for the book A Priest’s Life he says that he had expected to join his father’s law firm until he heard the Lord calling him to explore Christian community in the United States.  “I didn’t know it then but I was to spend only nine months in the next 26 years back in my homeland” he wrote.Kevin Ranaghan met Peter in South Africa in 1981. “I could see how deeply committed he was to the Lord and to the Church. I sensed that he was a young man seeking to serve and equipped with many gifts for service.”Peter joined the People of Praise in South Bend Indiana in 1983. He was ordained a priest in 2001 at age 43. In 2006 he earned a licentiate degree in canon law (J.C.L.) from the Catholic University of America. He served as pastor of St. Rose of Lima parish in Portland from 2006 to 2013.The Brotherhood of the People of Praise was established as a Private Association of the Faithful in the Catholic Church in 1999 by former Portland Archbishop John Vlazny following years of work by Joel Fr. Perron Auve (Vancouver-Portland) and others. This grant of juridical status paved the way for members of the Brotherhood to be ordained as Catholic priests while remaining members of the Brotherhood and members of the People of Praise. Joel notes that the Brotherhood is an ecumenical association according to its statutes though all of its current members are Roman Catholics. Following his ordination as bishop Peter will continue to live in the Brotherhood house in north Portland.“This is terrific news for our brother Peter” said Craig Lent the overall coordinator of the People of Praise. “I know I can speak for the whole community in expressing my heartfelt congratulations. I am delighted that Peter can serve the Catholic Church in this new way.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3406
3358,March 3 2014 8:13 p.m.,NOVA Volunteers Travel to Support Mission Work,Story by Chris Meehan. Indianapolis photos by Cathy Walters. Evansville photos by Mary Timler   David Frank and Jim Ryan replace the trim around the front windows of the new meeting room in Indianapolis. The northern Virginia branch sent 23 workers to tackle projects in Indianapolis and Evansville in mid February. The trips built on a successful trip last year which drew 16 people to one location the South Side of Indianapolis. Bill Sjoberg and a team of northern Virginia branch members organized the trips. They invited the whole branch to support them and many branch members found ways to help. “Some people prayed. Some gave money. Some made us food for the journey. Some took it upon themselves to shovel the driveways of team members who were in Indiana when over a foot of snow hit Virginia” Bill said. (For their part northern Virginia volunteers shoveled walks for local neighbors in Indy which was hit by five inches of snow.) Nick Holovaty expressed his thanks to everybody. “The northern Virginia teams got a ton of work done in Indianapolis and Evansville and definitely helped improve our properties. We hope more branches can make short trips like this in the future.”  Margaret Crimmins uses a wheelbarrow to cart tools on the South Side of Indianapolis. In Indianapolis much of the work focused on Cornerstone Commons at the corner of Meridian and Karcher. Some People of Praise members have purchased this 10000-square-foot property which includes eight apartments a small office space a warehouse a launderette and a retail area. On the February trip workers helped to convert the retail area into a space for community meetings. They moved a heavy machine which makes change cut out space for a new door and installed it tore out an old staircase and installed a new one among many other things. Pat Baldwin says “Mary Dohrman and I cleared out cobwebs especially from the basement ceiling.” Margaret Crimmins worked at Cornerstone Commons and also set out into the neighborhood with Naomi Coney. They carried boxes down from an elderly neighbor's attic on Union Street so she could organize them then moved her (small) piano for her. In Evansville the day began with some safety instructions from Paul Hommes then the team got down to work renovating a house. “It was a bit strenuous for an economist like me” noted Jim Lecky. “But I was happy I was able to do it. I did painting and wall repair worked on ventilation in a basement and helped put in a new subfloor for a bathroom. It was good at the end to see the progress we’d made.”  From left: Kevin McShane Cathy Johnson and Chris Vieck in Evansville. Contact with People of Praise missionaries was a huge part of the experience in Evansville—and not just via eating lunch or supper together. For example four people went out with the missionaries door to door. “I was impressed by the energy and dedication of these missionaries. They are making a difference in the neighborhood” Jim says. In addition to branch volunteers Bill arranged for five men from outside the community to join the work crews—members of a monthly men's prayer breakfast that he organizes in northern Virginia. Keith Colella who attends the monthly prayer breakfast noted “It was super to see the impact on the immediate community—from the youngest on up. I helped out with the boys’ group in Evansville on Saturday morning. There was one boy who was so excited that he came an hour early and just kept riding his bike around the block waiting for it to start.” Keith added “I enjoyed the way we integrated praise mission and home repair.”  Pete Schunk working in Evansville. Mike Ryan one of the prayer breakfast men invited his friend Jim Fogarty from Chicago who works with gangs. Jim went to the campus meeting in the Indianapolis Triangle where Walt Seale gave the Servant School talk on hospitality. Jim told Pam Seale later “Hospitality. You preach it. You teach it. You live it!” Northern Virginia branch member Carolyn Hornbuckle age 77 came down to Indianapolis from Chicago where she lives on assignment. She’s also a veteran of two trips to Allendale. “I always rejoice for the opportunity to be with brothers and sisters and watch them lay down their lives. Praise God I’m able to get up and go!” Bill summed it all up: “The trip exceeded my expectations. The level of enthusiasm was really encouraging. Near the end one team member said simply ‘I’d like to work longer. I'm not tired.’” “We’re so grateful that Bill took the initiative to organize these trips” Nick says. “It was very inspiring to see so many brothers and sisters take time off work and travel such a long way in order to help us. We were all built up by their sacrifices.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3358
3349,Dec. 9 2013 5:06 p.m.,Thanksgiving Surprise for Allendale Family,By Chris Meehan Some community members brightened the Thanksgiving celebrations of an Allendale family late last month. On the Tuesday evening before Thanksgiving Kathleen Mehaffey and Ben Reinhardt brought a basket to the home of a family with four children. The basket contained a 14-pound turkey dressing potatoes vegetables and dessert. The father of the family answered the door and shook their hands vigorously as he accepted the food. “Oh wow” he said. “The kids will be so happy. I can’t wait to tell them in the morning. They’ve been asking for turkey but it’s been several years since we could afford one.” The mother told them that she had been planning to buy a ham the next morning—all the family could afford. “This makes my day” the father added laughing. “I was getting tired of ham!” The basket came from Shreveport branch member Gwen Stuart. Gwen had been helping with a Thanksgiving-week food giveaway at the church where she works. The supervisor of the giveaway had given Gwen two food baskets to deliver to needy families. Gwen was unable to make contact with one family despite repeated phone calls and knocks on their door. The supervisor asked Gwen if she knew anyone else who could use the meal. “I’m sure I can find someone” Gwen replied thinking of the community’s outreach in Allendale. On Tuesday she dropped off the basket at the Allendale home of Ron and Ruthanne Seitz. The basket migrated from the Seitzes to the single women’s house headed by Kathleen. Over dinner the women brainstormed the names of families who might benefit from the basket and eventually settled on the family with four children. Some of the children had come to the community’s summer camp but the women wanted to get to know the parents better. “I think the Lord was being very specific in his care for those neighbors” says Kathleen. “We didn’t have reason to believe that they were any worse off than all the other poor families who live in our neighborhood but the Holy Spirit prompted us so we took the food to them.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3349
3345,Nov. 27 2013 4:44 p.m.,In Missionary Work Blessed Are the Annoying,In August George Kane moved to Evansville to join the Missionary Company. This article which he wrote originally appeared in the Nov. 15 2013 edition of The Message the weekly newspaper of the Catholic Diocese of Evansville IN. It is reprinted here with permission. By George Kane Missionaries don’t always receive warm welcomes. Sometimes our neighbors don’t know how to react when we show up in their front yard. In fact I ran into this situation on my first day of mission work in Evansville. It was Monday; and man it was hot. The August sun hit the asphalt and cooked up into our sandals as Dan and I walked along a deserted street. We crossed an intersection and saw three people talking by the curb a few houses down. “How about we talk to these guys?” Dan asked. I grinned and shrugged “Sure.” As a new missionary my job was to listen and learn from the others so I was happily off the hook when it came to starting conversations. “How y’all doing today?” Dan asked cheerfully extending his hand first to the 300-pound bald man standing on the curb and then to the man and woman straddling a moped. The big man took Dan’s hand coolly. “I’m Dublin” he said. He avoided Dan’s eyes and let go quickly. The man on the moped squinted at Dan’s open hand smirked and shook his head. “Naw man I’m not interested.”  A cold ulcer of embarrassment stung my stomach. I was unfamiliar with this kind of outright rejection which some of the veteran door-knocking missionaries affectionately call “eating doorknobs.” Dan was undeterred “Hey do you guys want to hear a story?” The man on the moped revved its engine and he and his passenger pulled away. “Holla a’chu later man!” Dublin called and then turned towards Dan and me. “Man I don’t want to be rude but I’m busy.” As he walked away around the corner I felt defeated. Not only did they not want to hear about the Gospel they didn’t even want to hear a word we had to say! All we had done was annoy them. Though I was upset about this then I found out later that Pope Francis actually may have been thrilled that I had gone out and been annoying that day. When speaking about proclaiming the gospel the Holy Father has said “Let us ask the Holy Spirit for this grace of apostolic zeal…and if we annoy people blessed be the Lord!” At that moment watching Dublin’s broad shoulders disappear around the corner I was pretty low on apostolic zeal. But Dan wasn’t. “Well shoot” he said “how about we knock at this house right here?” After two attempts at knocking though that door remained closed too. I was starting to feel even sorrier for myself when I heard behind us “Hey man the guy who lives there is crazy be careful.” It was Dublin! His bald head glinted under the sun and poured sweat into his eyes as he stood and talked with us. It turned out that Dublin used to be Lutheran but was now Muslim. The conversation started to drift towards argument when Dublin said “God knows all your sins even before you do them. It don’t matter what you want you gonna sin anyway. He’s got it all written in his book.” Dan raised his eyebrows. “But…aren’t I free? I’m gonna be tempted but I still have a choice about what I’m gonna do…right?” Dublin took a step back and brought one hand to his head waving the other at us “No man stop; you’re confusing me. I used to be confused about this stuff before … that was terrible being confused … I know what I believe now and I’m sticking to it.” When conversations about God start to get too close to home people often use this kind of theological debate as a smokescreen or sorts. So Dan changed the subject. “What if we pray for something together?” Dublin nodded slowly and then bowed his head and clasped his hands. He asked us to pray that God would provide for his family’s material needs and stood there quietly as we did just that. As we ended our prayer Dublin surprised us by saying “Thanks for being out here talking about God…people need it.” It was amazing. Dublin saw success where I could only see failure!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3345
3340,Nov. 27 2013 4:39 p.m.,New Book Brings Christ to the Workplace,By Sean Connolly Bill Dalgetty (northern Virginia) has written a new book of stories and insights called Hope for the Workplace. In the book Bill brings an optimistic message to Christians who must confront the harsh realities of the working world. His message: Christ is in you. It’s a reality that he says can transform the business world. “Headlines give the impression business is rife with greed and corruption” he writes in the Introduction. But “more and more Christians are making a difference in their workplaces . . . building God’s kingdom ‘on earth as it is in heaven.’” Bill draws on his career of 38 years as a lawyer and executive with Mobil Corporation and 10 years as the president of Christians in Commerce. Christians in Commerce is a business-focused ministry that Louis Grams Bud Rose and John Mooney founded in 1983. Perhaps as importantly Bill relies on his long experience as a Christian and a member of the People of Praise. “The message of the book reflects the teachings we’ve received in the People of Praise” he says. “If I hadn’t been in the community I don’t know that I would have seen this message just through my own experience.” To make his points Bill uses 51 real stories and examples drawn from community members and Christians in Commerce members he knows. But some of the best stories in the book are Bill’s own. In 1996 he became responsible for the global environmental health and safety performance of Mobil Corporation. He soon learned that Mobil lagged behind its competitors in worker safety and in lost-time accidents. Word got out that Bill was preparing to report these negative findings to the board. One manager threatened him with “blood on the floor”—meaning Bill’s blood—if he went ahead. Despite the pressure Bill made the report. After hearing it the chairman of Mobil told all the executive vice-presidents “I want us to change our performance in this area.” Over the next three years Bill led the charge. Mobil rose from seventh place to second place in worker safety among the eight major international oil companies. Bill says his book is different from other Christian business books on the market which tend to target Catholic or Protestant markets exclusively. Hope for the Workplace takes a broad ecumenical approach with quotations from leaders such as Billy Graham and Pope John Paul II. Joe Gibbs the former head coach of the Washington Redskins is one of several Christian leaders who have endorsed the book. “Hope for the Workplace captures the Christian truths by which I sought to live my life as a husband father football coach and owner of a NASCAR race team.” Bill is working hard to promote the book and its message and he hopes others will help by giving copies away to co-workers and friends. “I was at a writers’ guild meeting recently and I was explaining the book to the people there. When I told them it was a book about living out our faith in the workplace I could see that I wasn’t generating much attention. I decided to change my approach and I began telling people that it was a book about being Christ in the workplace. The response was dramatically different much more enthusiastic.” Bill is offering his book for sale at a Christmas special price of $12.95.

3290,Nov. 12 2013 3:06 p.m.,Into the Joy,Story by Sean Connolly photos by Margaret DeCelles video from Ellen Putzier Thomas Duddy raised his left hand in a gesture of praise as he and his bride Jeanette (Zimmel . . . until 45 minutes previously) walked briskly down the red-carpeted aisle of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Shreveport. Some 150 voices in the congregation—Hawaiian voices southern voices Minnesota voices Missionary voices New Orleans voices Shreveport voices Virginia voices a lone Portland voice (Fr. Chuck Wood’s) and children’s voices—rang out as one voice “Shout joyfully to God all the earth; sing to the glory of his name!” The ushers swung wide the front doors of the church to reveal a heavy rain hammering the pavement outside. Jeanette’s brother David Zimmel a groomsman trailed behind his sister and felt the panic as the procession neared the doors. Then as he recalls “Out of the mist stepped Nick Raway (Mission Division Shreveport) holding a giant umbrella. Then a neurosurgeon from the clinic where Jeanette works came from the other side carrying an umbrella from his car.” Thomas Jeanette and their wedding party continued through the rain but sheltered by umbrellas to the getaway car. The congregation sang on “Let them be jubilant full of his joy” and the joy soaked into the people as the rain saturated the ground outside. This was the third time Christians in Mission team members living in Allendale had married each other. Nathan and Genevieve (DeCelles) Barrett broke the ice in 2007 with Josh and Mary Claire (Busk) Caneff following them in 2012. But Thomas and Jeanette were the first to hold their wedding in Shreveport in a church just a stone’s throw from Allendale. This meant that neighbors could attend the festivities and that the festivities themselves could more obviously point to the greater missionary burden the Lord is calling the People of Praise to shoulder in Allendale. Even the wedding cake told a larger story. Its white top displayed a map of the Mississippi River Valley outlined in black icing with red dots indicating Indianapolis Evansville and Shreveport the sites of the community’s missions along with the words of a prayer “Let your glory fill the valley.” Choosing a Shreveport wedding meant that there were fewer traditions and precedents to fall back on than in a larger branch where community weddings are more common. Every detail from food to photographer to reception hall needed to be researched thought about decided. With their blood families an ocean away in Hawaii (in Thomas’s case) and a 900-mile drive away in Minnesota (in Jeanette’s case) their Christians in Mission team members became the family to fall back on when it came to planning and executing. The CIM team in turn fell back on the Shreveport branch just as they do each summer when Action volunteers come to town. For the wedding weekend 32 guests stayed in the CIM team’s seven houses on Yale Avenue in addition to the 21 team members who normally live there. Another 31 guests stayed with Shreveport branch members and hospitality coordinator Patti Deakin says that somehow she didn’t have to turn anybody away.  Cliff and Jackie Vaughan opened an empty house they own to Jim and Beth Bulger and Elizabeth Pease from Servant Branch Kate Zenker and Annie Bulger from South Bend along with Justin and Cathy Walters from the Indy South Side and four Purdue University students who slept in sleeping bags in an apartment above the garage. “You never knew who you would be eating breakfast with” said Beth. The distances from Shreveport to Hawaii and Minnesota meant that the parents of the bride and groom Tom and Mary Duddy of Kaneohe (Oahu) and John and Jo Zimmel of St. Paul (Servant Branch) had never met prior to the week of the wedding. The Duddys had never met Jeanette except through Skype video conferences on their computer. At the bachelor party on Thursday night Pat Malone shared a story about Thomas that revealed how deeply Thomas identifies with his Allendale neighbors. Three years ago Ed Allison a gentleman in his early 70s was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor. “Ed was given a short time to live” Pat recalled. When Thomas heard the news “he was moved by love for Ed and he told the Lord in no uncertain terms that this wasn’t Ed’s time to die.” Thomas began visiting Ed talking about the Lord with him praying with him using his skills as a nurse to help him. He got everyone on the CIM team to pray for Ed and to the shock of everyone in the hospital Ed recovered. He had arrived at the hospital in a wheelchair but he left on his own two feet and began living independently again. “Ed will tell you that the prayers of Thomas and everyone else kept him alive” Pat said. The rehearsal dinner on Friday night took place beneath a white canopy erected in the grass front yard of 1434 Yale Avenue. Folding tables dressed with white tablecloths held handmade centerpieces: glass vases filled with purple wandering Jew plants and their tiny pink flowers gathered from the yard. Catherine Bulger (South Bend) arranged the food and service for the 71 guests. It was simple fare: subs from Walmart homemade guacamole hummus and salad. About an hour before the dinner a car from Servant Branch arrived carrying the servants: the Bulgers Elizabeth Pease Nancy Grams Mary Bredenburg and Kate Zenker. This was by design to enable the CIM team members to pause from their preparations and savor the moment. After the main course Thomas and Jeanette stood up and honored their parents. Thomas said that during his late teenage years he had begun living a wayward life. Later in his 20s after the Lord had opened his eyes he had told his father that he wanted to build a stronger relationship with him even though it would need to be built at a distance. Thomas had decided to move to Servant Branch to live with the Brotherhood for a time and to attend college. “You welcomed me back” he told his father. Though it wasn’t mentioned at the rehearsal dinner on Friday night Ron Gouveia (Oahu) a longtime friend of the Duddys and the only other member of the Oahu branch who was able to make the 4000-mile trip sees some parallels between the choices of Thomas and Tom. “The Duddys came to Hawaii in 1980 because of military service. They are originally from the east coast. Five or six years after they came they had to make a decision about where to go next and they decided that the Lord was calling them to stay and be part of the Oahu branch.” Staying in Hawaii meant that the Duddy kids would not have much contact with their east coast relatives and that branch members would have to play the roles of aunties and uncles of grandmothers and grandfathers. “The Duddys laid down their lives for the building of the People of Praise” says Ron. “I can see Thomas following in their footsteps.” In her sharing Jeanette said that her parents had placed a high priority on personal prayer when she was growing up leaving a lasting impression. She recalled seeing her mother sitting in a chair each morning having her prayer time. Jeanette didn’t always see her father pray but she knew that he had prayed whenever she saw him at breakfast reading the comics in the morning paper. Her dad had made a commitment to get his prayer time in before ever turning to the funnies. After the honorings the mosquitoes came out in force and the group moved inside 1434 Yale where members of the Missionary Company from Evansville took up banjo cello mandolin and harmonica for the first of several weekend musical performances. Ringing out a riff in the clawhammer style Nick Holovaty kicked off an uptempo bluegrass number he had written. Mary Timler laid down the low notes by plucking on her cello. The lyrics of the tune spoke of the way in which Jesus spreads his message “Face to Face One by One” also the song’s title.  Just before noon the next morning wedding guests collected their programs at church from a young teenage girl in a shimmering dress whom Jeanette had befriended over the course of her years living in Allendale. Fr. Chuck Wood (Vancouver-Portland) presided and Mike Coney (New Orleans) a deacon preached and received the wedding vows. The first reading came from the prophet Zephaniah: “I will save the lame and assemble the outcasts; I will give them praise and renown in all the earth when I bring about their restoration.” The Gospel reading was Matthew 5:1-12 the Beatitudes “Blessed are the poor in spirit . . . .”  In his homily Mike emphasized that Jesus intended the Beatitudes to be lived out by his followers and that the blessings and rewards mentioned in connection with mourning meekness etc. are meant for this life not only for the life to come. They are the fruit of living the gospel. The petitions like the cake pointed to mission—both the community’s mission and the mission of the whole church: “For boldness in proclaiming the gospel for faith in good times and in bad for greater unity among all Christians . . . we pray to the Lord.”  They also included a prayer for Ed Allison who had taken a turn for the worse in the weeks leading up to the wedding. The missionaries sang two hymns: “How Firm a Foundation” and a rewritten version of “Hark I Hear the Harps Eternal.” “The choral music was absolutely glorious” said Ron Gouveia. “The Lord was there in such power” added Teresa Lynch (Shreveport). “The focus was on this wonderful thing that God was doing for Thomas and Jeanette. It wasn’t anything like the traditional wedding. I kept thinking I wish my daughters could see this!” The rain that began midway through the wedding ceremony continued joined by lightning and thunderclaps during the reception which took place in a hall on the grounds of the American Rose Society. As she raised a glass to toast Jeanette Kathleen Mehaffey her maid of honor told a bit of Jeanette’s story. Jeanette has lived in Allendale two times first beginning in 2007 for three years then again starting in the fall of 2012 (following a two-year stint in the Missionary Company). “When Jeanette lived here the first time she and Laura Brummer would go out visiting older women who lived alone in our neighborhood. Jeanette was moved by these women and loved them. After prayer and discernment she helped start a walking group with them. Five years later these women are still walking three times a week and some of the women are here celebrating with Jeanette today.” Jeanette works as a phone operator at the Spine Institute of Louisiana where she is known for the limericks she writes on colored paper for the doctors and each of the staff members on their birthdays. “Jeanette carries with her the fragrance of Christ” Kathleen said. “It lingers in the places she has worked the households she has lived in and it rests on anyone who has had a conversation with her.” Thomas also has a reputation at his job—for praying with his patients as Nathan Barrett his best man pointed out in his toast. Thomas is a nurse at the VA hospital in Shreveport. Recently he leaned over to pray with a patient as a student nurse stood by watching him. “I didn’t know we were allowed to do that!” the student told Thomas later. Another time a patient caught up with Thomas after he had prayed with him. “As soon as you left my room after praying with me” he said “I had to call up my family and tell them ‘You guys won’t believe it but Jesus lives at this hospital. This nurse just came up and prayed with me!’” After the toasts and customary first dances Jo Zimmel called everyone up to dance the Virginia reel a country dance. “I asked for two sets of eight couples” she says but she was surprised when four sets of eight couples arranged themselves and prepared to dance. Soon she was having trouble teaching everyone the steps. One of the servers from the catering company stepped in to help as did others who knew the routine. “It was more like bumper cars than the Virginia reel” observed Patti Deakin. “Everyone was laughing and having so much fun even the catering guys were videoing it on their phones and just laughing.” Cheers rang out as Nathan Barrett and Nick Raway sashayed forward and back while holding Madeleine Barrett (age 18 months) and Marie Elise Barrett (age three). All the while two uniformed sheriff’s deputies (their presence was mandated by the Rose Society) sat outside the building with guns and Tasers at their side. (One drove up in a paddy wagon the other in a Police Interceptor.) The officers were looking serious until Nick Raway sent them inside to get some gumbo red beans and rice and banana pudding. The reception ended at six but an hour later guests began to reassemble back in Allendale for another party. The party grew and stretched across three houses and onto their front porches. Near the end the missionaries performed a few more numbers. Chris Vieck shared a bluegrass song she had written for her father. The missionaries reprised “Face to Face One by One” with the whole crowd joining in on the chorus. Rus Lyons performed a rap he wrote called “The Clear and Present Gospel.” Everyone sang along to the old spiritual “Ride on King Jesus” and to J-T Kelly’s song “City of God.” The party ended with the Wesleyan hymn “I Will Arise and Go to Jesus.” On Sunday a few of the out-of-town guests toured the neighborhood including Nancy Grams. “I’ve seen pictures and videos but I was totally astonished. The houses the porches the sidewalks—it was really beautiful. I could see how we were being a light just by living ordinary life just by being who we are in the People of Praise. It’s so easy to do it because we are right there.” The next Tuesday back home in Hawaii Tom Duddy reflected on the meaning of all that he had seen. “I am proud of the Oahu branch way out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and the impact that we have been able to have on the whole life of the People of Praise. Over the years we’ve sent out Dave Sklorenko Bob and Bev Linczer Geoff and Sue Kelleher Bob Chukinas Larry and Valerie Day Joe Gomes Zach Busekrus and others and now Thomas. Even though we are a small and distant branch we have been able to have an impact.” A moment before the wedding party stepped into the aisle to begin their closing procession  Fr. Chuck read a blessing: “May you be witnesses in the world to God’s charity so that the afflicted and needy who have known your kindness may one day receive you thankfully into the eternal dwelling of God.” Chris Vieck (Mission Division Evansville) a bridesmaid said later that the words struck her. “I know one of the reasons Jeanette wants to be married is to take care of lots of people.” “Individually Thomas and Jeanette both have a deep heart for the poor and those who haven’t had the gospel preached to them” said Tom Duddy. “They wanted the wedding to make a statement about that work. Their intention their expectation is to spend their married life in Allendale. It isn’t a stopping point on the way to something else.” Thomas and Jeanette are simply moving ahead two who have become one into the joy taking no notice of the rain. Thomas and Jeanette now live in a house on Yale Avenue that Action volunteers renovated with help from Ed Allison. Ed died four days after the wedding.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3290
3293,Nov. 12 2013 2:55 p.m.,Missionary Brings His Faith to Evansville Streets,"Evansville missionaries: Back row from left: Evan Lent Nick Holovaty David Zimmel Jon Earhart Paul Hommes. Third Row: Dan Schwab George Kane Kevin McShane Rus Lyons. Second row: Abby Earhart Gianna Priolo Kaitlyn Raway. Front row: Mary Timler Ellen Reid Chris Vieck In August George Kane moved to Evansville to join the Missionary Company. This article which he wrote originally appeared in the Oct. 25 2013 edition of The Message the weekly newspaper of the Catholic Diocese of Evansville IN. It is reprinted here with permission. I grew up in an Irish Catholic family of 10 in the Washington D.C. area. When I was five my family joined an ecumenical Christian community called the People of the Praise which included many members of our home parish. As I grew up many of my closest friends were a part of this community and the combination of their positive influence and the Christ-centered life of the community has anchored my faith. I moved to Evansville in August to begin a two-year stint as a missionary sponsored by the People of Praise. I’ve been inspired by Pope Francis’ exhortation that “The Church must be taken into the streets” and I want to spend the next two years of my life doing exactly that! The story of Alana is an example of the mission work we’re doing here. It was just after two on a sunny Tuesday and I was walking through the projects with Kaitlyn a fellow missionary. I noticed that behind a nearby screen a door was open. “How about this one?” I asked Kaitlyn “Anything come to mind?” As missionaries we often share “words” with the people we meet. These words are the fruit of the daily hour of prayer we spend in preparation for our mission work. Sometimes we’ll be moved to tell one of the Jesus’ parables or to share a piece of scripture that stood out to us. Other times we’ll deliver a simple message of encouragement teaching or even correction. Kaitlyn had a word so we headed toward the door. Before I could even knock the screen door flew open and a small middle-aged woman in a khaki head sash beckoned “Come on in!” Kaitlyn and I grinned and laughed a little as we sat down. We don’t always get such a warm welcome!  ""God sent us out to talk to our neighbors today"" I said ""and we felt moved to share a word with you…would you like to hear it?"" Alana bounded to her bookshelf and pulled out a big crimson bible. ""Of course!"" she said ""What is it?"" Kaitlyn explained ""In Luke 9 Jesus feeds 5000 people miraculously. When Jesus told the Apostles 'You yourselves give them something to eat' he was telling them to have courage to trust in their ability as his disciples to overcome even the biggest logistical challenges. In Christ you can have this same courage!"" When Kaitlyn finished there was silence. Alana blinked back tears and sighed deeply. A sad smile tugged at the edge of her mouth. Then she began to tell us her story. In her 20’s she had been imprisoned for attempted murder and drug abuse. Once released she had reconciled with the woman whom she had shot but remained estranged from her family. Now Alana was badly behind on her bills. A known drug dealer had been visiting offering her “free” money but she knew better. Alana had been struggling calling out to God for direction right when we arrived. Alana was amazed. God knew He was really looking out for her! By the time we left Alana’s smile was stretching from one end of the small apartment to the other. Alana wasn’t the only one who experienced God working that day. I heard God speak His Word through Kaitlyn. I saw that word strike deeply into Alana. It made her weep smile and regain hope amidst crushing odds. It might be tempting to think that Evansville is already Christian has already heard the gospel and doesn’t need missionaries. The 9mm gunshots that sound down the street however tell a different story. So does the rising rate of suicide in Indiana – which according to the Centers for Disease Control rose 50 percent since 1999. Clearly violence and despair still reign in the lives of many. We hope our conversation with Alana will be the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship. Please join me in praying for Alana and for the rest of Evansville. In Christ we cannot fail!",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3293
3258,Sept. 25 2013 2:19 p.m.,With 4 Blue Ribbons Trinity Greenlawn Joins the Nation's Top Schools,"by Sean Connolly  Trinity School at Greenlawn earned its fourth blue ribbon award from the US Department of Education on Tuesday September 24. With the award Trinity joins a group of eight high schools (three private schools and five public schools) in the entire United States who are four-time winners according to a spokeswoman for the Department of Education. (Between 1982 and 2012 just 35 high schools had won the award three or more times.) Trinity is also the only Indiana school to win four blue ribbon awards. “This fourth award speaks volumes about the consistency of our academic approach over more than 30 years” says head of school John Lee (South Bend). “Our parents and students believe in what we’re doing as a school and our faculty continually put the students first. We are all very proud and grateful to God for this accomplishment.” To qualify for the award this year Greenlawn students had to score in the top 15 percent nationally on the SAT and the school had to submit an application describing its mission and curriculum. Just 50 private schools in the country were selected as winners this year. Greenlawn has now won the blue ribbon award under four different heads of school: Bill Wacker (1989) Debbie Mixell (1993) Tom Finke (2003) and John Lee (2013). John will travel to Washington D.C. to accept the award in November. The award is also the seventh time a Trinity School campus has won a blue ribbon. Trinity School at Meadow View won the award most recently in 2010. River Ridge won in 1996 and in 2008. “Of course we have always aimed to achieve excellence in education” notes Kerry Koller (South Bend) the president of Trinity Schools and a member of the People of Praise board of governors ""so I am not surprised by this news. The award does mean that our reputation for excellence is growing and we hope that with this growth we will be able to bring the benefits of a Trinity education to many more students. It is part of our mission as a community to educate children in a ‘true and integral Christian humanism’ as our Spirit and Purpose says—both community children and all of the children that the Lord sends to our schools. We are grateful to be able to live out each day this part of the Lord’s call for us.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3258
3223,Aug. 8 2013 4:42 p.m.,In Allendale Community Grows With Camp and a Garden,Ed Konczeski (Tampa) helped organize a community garden as part of the summer camp put on by Action volunteers. By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly. Photos: Sam Mertz and Laura Brummer. Action volunteers wrapped up another summer of work in Shreveport’s Allendale neighborhood on August 2. The volunteers left in their wake a trail of happy children grateful neighbors repaired homes and a community garden flush with growing fruits and vegetables. At a concluding barbecue the children swarmed everywhere playing football and jumping rope in the 98-degree heat. A few neighbors wandered down the block to check on the fruits and vegetables sprouting in the community garden. Gospel music blared from the speakers of a nearby car as girls performed a praise dance they had learned at summer camp. Nathan Barrett stood on a picnic table to address the group of neighbors volunteers and Shreveport branch members speaking of Pentecost and leading a prayer that God would pour out his Spirit on young and old alike. Just before the barbecue Patti Deakin drove around the neighborhood picking up older neighbors. One woman whose granddaughter had attended camp brought three containers of food along with a chocolate sheet cake with frosted flowers on top and a message written in sugary lettering “God Bless the POP.” “This is my way to say thank you to all of you” she told Patti. A boy tries on firefighting pants during a visit to camp made by Shreveport firefighters. In total sixty-four volunteers served in Allendale this summer. They spent their mornings running a camp for children and in the afternoon tackled projects for neighbors and the Christians in Mission team. A staff of 13 (including seven college students) kept the volunteers fed housed and organized with a big assist from seven more high school student interns who served as camp leaders prepared meals and kept records. Most days more than 50 children came to camp with an attendance high of 67 breaking last year’s record. The camp was organized into seven groups: three for boys three for girls and a combined preschool group. Sam Mertz (South Bend) oversaw the boys’ groups. A chalkboard sign posted near the boys’ gathering place listed rules (among them: No Fighting) along with the consequence for using foul language—five push ups. The sign bore the boys’ signatures indicating their acceptance of the terms. Colleen Murray oversaw the girls’ groups. She says one highlight came when a local grandmother proudly sang a version of the Lord’s Prayer that her granddaughters had taught her after learning it at camp. A girl shows off a green pepper that grew in the community garden. The community garden was the brainchild of retiree Ed Konczeski (Tampa) a lifelong gardener with experience growing plants in clay soil. He planned the garden in the spring working with Ben Reinhardt to collect landscape timbers (needed for raised beds) and 600 feet of pipe and other components for an irrigation system. The Tampa branch covered the costs of seeds starter plants and supplies. A former neighbor offered his empty lot as the site for the garden and a Shreveport dentist loaned his rototiller. Action intern Cassie Busekrus (Oahu) managed the project assigning responsibility for plots among the various camp groups. Cassie says she enjoyed watching five-year-old campers gently carrying small paper cups filled with water to the green bean plants they were tending. Tomatoes and peppers arrived first but now cantaloupes strawberries eggplants lettuce carrots spinach radishes cucumbers watermelon squash okra and green beans are coming in strong. “The kids were motivated to help even outside of normal camp hours—especially after we referred to the weeds as ‘the bad guys’” Cassie says. “I can’t believe we’ll have any trouble getting volunteers for picking.” Joe Bulger (South Bend) supervised the work crews who sweated through the afternoons. “We worked on five repair projects for our neighbors. We installed sheetrock on a ceiling did some interior and exterior painting built a retaining wall rebuilt a front porch and repaired a wheelchair ramp” he says. Volunteer Stephen Magill 15 (northern Virginia) says a highlight came on a walk through the neighborhood with several other volunteers. “A man came up to us and told us that his sister had died of cancer and his son was in jail. He asked us to pray with him. He said he knew we were part of the People of Praise. It was really awesome!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3223

3207,June 10 2013 9:55 a.m.,New Presentation Aims to Spread The Fire,"By Sean Connolly and Chris MeehanKevin Ranaghan and Louis Grams are developing a practical way to equip brothers and sisters to spread baptism in the Holy Spirit from person to person wherever they are. It is a one-hour presentation that aims to help community members to “Spread the Fire” as they call it. Over the years as Kevin and Louis note in their presentation “Community members have prayed with people on street corners in grocery stores on airplanes at scenic overlooks and in their homes. . . . If we are alert to the movement of the Holy Spirit in our own hearts and in conversations we have with others we may well find many more opportunities to pray with others for baptism in the Spirit than we might imagine.” Louis researched and wrote “Spread the Fire” in 2012. Kevin has presented a preliminary version of the material in six branches so far. He says the final version may be used during the annual visits that he and other members of the branch relations council make to branches. The presentation peppered with stories and examples from community members explains how to recognize opportunities to pray with a person and how to ask important preparatory questions. It outlines four steps involved in prayer for baptism in the Spirit and describes how to follow-up afterwards. The presentation includes a hand out summarizing the material and a small card designed to fit inside a wallet that can be used to recall quickly the four steps to follow and the preparatory questions. The inspiration for the presentation came after Kevin noticed conversations that had sprouted up in several branches about the work God is calling the community to do. Kevin says these conversations began gathering steam after brothers and sisters watched The Roots of the People of Praise video as part of their celebrations of the community’s 40th anniversary. “Many people noticed how in the video Paul DeCelles said that it is perhaps now after 40 years that we are finally ready to do the work the Father has called us to do.” One possible response to Paul’s statement Kevin says is to turn to the first section of the Spirit and Purpose which describes our commitment as a community “to strive to lead all people into fullness of baptism in the Spirit.” ""The ‘Spread the Fire’ presentation is about some simple ways we can act on this commitment” he says. The presentation is already bearing fruit. A week after Kevin gave it in Colorado Springs branch member Phil Ehemann had already put it to work in the Air Force Academy gym where he regularly works out. He prayed with two people for baptism in the Spirit in the weightlifting room and then he prayed with the supervisor of the lifeguards at the pool. The next weekend Phil and his wife Carol prayed with a couple they had invited over for a Lord’s Day meal. On a recent vacation Phil prayed with eight more friends and family members. He says that hearing the presentation helped him to be bolder than he has been in the past. “Our life together as a community is sustained and driven by the power of the Holy Spirit” Kevin and Louis say in the presentation. “Why would we not want to share with others the deep well of life and power that we drink from?”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3207

Photo courtesy of Thomas Duddy.            Ed home from the hospital with nurse Thomas Duddy.         Ed Allison 71 a good friend and neighbor of the Christians in Mission team in Shreveport's Allendale neighborhood credits God and neighbor Pat Malone with saving his life on a recent Monday morning. “Ed has been battling colon cancer for two years” Pat explains. “He lives alone and I visit him about twice a week. Normally I don’t visit him on Mondays but on March 25 as I was doing my household chores and praying for Ed I had the sense that the Lord wanted me to check on him as soon as possible.” After lunch Pat walked the two blocks to Ed’s. The doorbell wasn’t working. “I tried calling him but his phone was out of order” Pat says. “Normally I would have just come back later but I had a sense I should try again to rouse him. I knocked on the door several times and then pounded on his window until he finally came to the door.” Ed was weak and struggling. He was bleeding and couldn't get the bleeding stopped. He wasn’t thinking clearly. After they prayed Ed decided to go to the hospital. Since Pat doesn’t drive they used Pat’s phone to call a friend. “We got him to the hospital right away” says Pat. Ed’s bleeding was related to an inoperable tumor. At the hospital he received blood transfusions and the bleeding eventually stopped. Hospital staff placed him in a palliative care unit. His caregivers were concerned that his tumor could rupture again but 16 days later Ed returned home. “I don’t know where Jesus is leading me” Ed says. “I’m just holding his hand.” Though his health is still frail Ed says that he’s excited to see the kingdom of God breaking out in the neighborhood he’s called home for 40 years. “God’s work is going on here. I want to see this movement spread. I’m so grateful to your whole organization. I’m so glad you came. I’m grateful to God for saving my life by having Pat come over find me and help get me to the hospital.” Pat says he’s grateful to spend regular time with Ed. “He always wants to be prayed with for healing and he likes nothing better than to hear me read Scripture aloud and then discuss it. Keep praying for this good brother in Christ.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3184
3173,April 25 2013 12:41 p.m.,Branches Work to Spread the Holy Spirit,By Chris Meehan Several branches are launching initiatives aimed at sharing the Holy Spirit and the blessings of community life with their friends neighbors and coworkers. Here are some examples: In Buffalo the branch has begun monthly open prayer meetings. The meetings are part of a larger plan to get the word out to the surrounding region about the People of Praise and baptism in the Spirit. “Our Spirit and Purpose says that spreading baptism in the Holy Spirit is part of who we are” notes Tom Shriver Buffalo’s principal branch coordinator. “During the past year we looked around and didn’t see anyone in the area actively doing that so we volunteered to the Lord. At the same time we realized that we must have kept a relatively low profile over the years because so many people didn’t seem to know we even existed.” As part of this plan the branch has opened up some branch activities to friends acquaintances and family members. The new open prayer meetings are scheduled on the fourth Sunday of each month (there have been three meetings so far). Branch members also solicited an article about the community from the local Catholic newspaper. “We figured that the fact that members of 14 different parishes work together in an ecumenical outreach is a story worth telling” says Tom. Between 50 and 75 people came to each of the three prayer meetings and about a quarter of them were new folks estimates Jim Peters who led one of the meetings and gave a talk at another. Rosanne Tabone a good friend and guest of branch member Cindy Widmer has attended all three and enjoys her chances to pray with the branch. “The meetings are wonderful. You can feel the Holy Spirit fill the room” she said. The open meetings have a familiar prayer-meeting format and participants also receive a newsletter which lists all upcoming community events to which they are invited. Peter Hammer leads the music and intersperses contemporary worship songs with community favorites. A seder followed the most recent meeting. “New technology has been a help to us in raising our flag” adds Arlene Meyerhofer. She created a Facebook page to promote the meetings and lists the event on the local Craigslist web site. She was delighted when during one meeting a young guest pulled out his smartphone during a period of praise recorded a section and had it posted to the branch’s Facebook page before the meeting had ended. “One day perhaps we’ll use Skype to bring the meeting to shut-ins” says Arlene. *** Saskatoon branch members are meeting in small groups to discuss the meditations on the life of Christ that Craig Lent introduced in 2009. The branch has two groups that meet every other week. Members rotate the responsibility of picking the next scene in Christ’s life to pray and talk about. “Ken Roberts Phil and Suzanne Rooke Iris McAleese and I gather on Friday mornings usually at Grainfield’s family-run restaurant” says branch leader Glenn Hilton. “It’s a good environment. The waitresses know what we’re doing so they serve us breakfast and then leave us alone to talk. When I get something significant from a particular passage it usually turns out to be only about a quarter of what I ultimately get out of it after hearing everybody else’s take on it. There are lots of ‘Wow!’ moments. That really enriches my experience.” Once the meetings were established and running well the members began to see them as an opportunity for outreach. “Our life is all about being friends with Jesus so what better way to help people get to know him than through these meditations on Christ’s life” Glenn explains. “So we recently decided to invite guests to join us for these meditations and discussions.” Ray Hickey is a member of the Thursday evening group along with his wife Judy Roger Schmitz Cathy Rice and--depending on her work schedule--Suzanne Rooke. “We’ve already had one guest” says Ray “and he enjoyed it so much he has returned.” *** On three Saturday mornings this spring in Servant Branch about 50 men came together at the branch’s center to learn and talk about the role of Christian men in the modern world. Topics at these open events included: “Living the Gospel of Jesus Christ Today” (March 2) “Careers Crisis and Character” (March 23) and “Marriage Money and Life” (April 13). Servant Branch men sponsored the events “because we have a desire to shine the light of Christ on the people we meet every day particularly at work” says Joel Kibler principal branch coordinator. Joel and Steve Becker who was the main organizer of the events especially hoped to attract younger men in their twenties and thirties. Branch members Sam Claassen CEO and president of SEH Engineering Bob Brickweg IBM senior client executive and Judge Chris Dietzen of the Minnesota Supreme Court each gave talks. Bill Wacker a father of five challenged husbands to pour themselves out for their families as Christ did on the cross. Mike Wacker encouraged the men to follow God wholeheartedly trusting him to fulfill all their financial needs. Several young community men gave short personal sharings at each event. “I’m pleased with the results” says Steve. “At the first two events over half the attendees were not in the People of Praise and half were in their 20s through early 40s. Some guests came to all three events and I think there were six entirely new men at the third gathering. I got very positive feedback from them.” One man Steve invited Mark Motzel is vice-president of operations at Trademark Transportation where Steve worked before his retirement. Mark not only said yes to his first invitation but returned twice more bringing friends with him. During one of the meetings Mark was seated near the front and couldn’t see the faces of the men behind him who were asking questions and sharing their stories. “I was struck by the fact that I usually couldn’t tell if the men sharing behind me were in their 20s or 60s. God’s call and their response was a theme that resonated across the generations! It was encouraging to hear such powerful stories and to be part of the strong praise and worship.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3173

Tom Zusi 15 a ninth-grader at Trinity School at Greenlawn finished second in a regional ballet competition in Indianapolis in early March beating dancers from across the country. His performance of “Franz’s Variation” from Coppelia earned him a spot in a national ballet competition in New York City in April.  The Indianapolis semifinal was sponsored by Youth America Grand Prix (YAGP) “the largest student ballet scholarship competition in the world” according to the YAGP web site.  It brought together more than 500 student dancers representing 72 dance schools from 18 states Canada and Japan. Tom competed in the junior division as a member of South Bend’s Southold Dance Theater. He is the son of Mike and Nora Zusi (South Bend).,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3130
3100,Feb. 23 2013 noon,Northern Virginia Adults Volunteer on the Indy South Side,Rick Ridenour (left) replaces a window. By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly. Photos courtesy of Bill Sjoberg. Fifteen adult volunteers traveled from northern Virginia to the Indianapolis South Side last week for a home renovation blitz. “They put in over 400 hours of work over three days” said Paul Hommes who drove up from Evansville to manage the projects. “They worked on three different houses and dove right in: demolition plumbing framing floor installation prepping and painting walls and hauling lumber.”  This house on Union Street is undergoing major renovations. Bill Sjoberg (northern Virginia) organized the trip for a group of branch members who shared a strong desire to see the community’s work in Indianapolis firsthand. “The work was more physically strenuous than a lot of us were used to” he admitted “but where else can you get so tired and filthy and love every minute of it? We were sore at night but we were all talking about wanting to come back and do it again.” The group spent months planning for the trip with members carefully arranging their work schedules to make travel possible. Margaret Crimmins (northern Virginia) said she appreciated the chance to learn how to use a nail gun and a caulk gun. “I learned a lot of practical little things that made me feel more capable.” Northern Virginia branch members were joined by members of the Indianapolis branch college students from the Triangle South Side residents and a few visitors from Evansville. “Everybody I met interacted or worked with had the same spirit--a warmth that radiated from them a sparkle in their eyes. It gave me energy throughout the day” Margaret said. During their down time volunteers participated in an open house with South Side neighbors. They also visited the campus division in the Triangle area of Indianapolis. They attended the annual Action fundraiser a dinner dance and auction sponsored by the Indianapolis branch. (The dance netted $5000 according to Mark Sklorenko who was responsible for the event's finances.) Walt and Pam Seale who used to live in northern Virginia organized hospitality for the trip and arranged the schedule. Volunteers stayed in the Triangle and in branch members' homes. Most of the work centered around a 2500-square-foot house at 1644 Union Street. Action volunteers had gutted the house last summer but progress had slowed down after that with fewer volunteers and cold weather. The Christians in Mission team has a deadline of September 1 for getting the house into move-in condition. “The northern Virginia volunteers put us miles ahead of where were” said Michael Coney who leads the Indy CIM team. “The second floor of the house is mostly framed now and we are almost ready to begin plumbing and electrical work. We still have a long way to go on both floors. We need more volunteers like the NOVA volunteers to meet our goal. We'd be happy to talk to any other individuals and groups interested in volunteering.” The house is being remodeled to accommodate a large household. Plans call for a large living room and a dining room that faces a wide-open backyard that can be shared with neighboring community households. The floor plan was designed with flexible spaces to enable lots of hospitality.  Volunteers from northern Virginia participated in a prayer meeting on the South Side. Lisa Tychsen (northern Virginia) said the visit gave her a new perspective on the community’s work in Indianapolis. “I had watched the ‘Revive This Land’ video of Jared Gonzalez singing in Indy and I noticed all the different people but actually being there helped me see the ‘connective tissue’ so to speak between all the different works of the People of Praise in Indianapolis: the Action trips college student life in the Triangle the CIM team on the South Side and the wonderful Indy branch.” David Smedburg who recently came underway in the northern Virginia branch joined the team to serve and to learn more about the community. He was particularly happy to learn about framing while working with a professional contractor and brother in his branch Steve Forbes. He said he also appreciated the daily morning prayer and fellowship time on the trip. Maria Elliott (northern Virginia) says “At times it seemed like I was doing small things like caulking and painting a bathroom but they had to be done so they were important. I identified with the sentiments of my children who have come back from Indy or Allendale and said ‘Mom it was hard but I did real work!’”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3100

3080,Dec. 27 2012 10:35 a.m.,In Minnesota Christmas Comes to Prisoners' Children,"By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly Around 100 Servant Branch members continued a long tradition this December by buying Christmas presents and delivering them to children of prisoners. Bob O’Connell organized this year’s effort just as he has for the last 30 years. ""Bob and so many others have worked tirelessly for years in this wonderful labor of love” notes principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler. The gift-giving is part of Project Angel Tree a national ministry started by Mary Kay Beard a former convict who became a Christian. Angel Tree began in Alabama in 1982 and quickly spread. Bob read about it in New Wine magazine soon after and suggested that Servants of the Lord community get involved. The tradition continued after Servants of the Lord became part of the People of Praise. Bob estimates that community members have given presents to about 2000 children over the years. This year Servant Branch members made phone calls bought presents wrapped them and delivered them to families in the Twin Cities and their suburbs as well as in towns spread across the region from Hudson Duluth and Superior to as far as Fargo North Dakota. They bought and delivered Christmas toys and clothing to 67 children of prisoners. “But the numbers aren’t the goal” Bob is quick to say. “The goal is bringing the Lord to the children their guardians and to incarcerated parents.” Some of the community volunteers are new to Angel Tree--like the young Girls of Praise who baked Christmas cookies to accompany the presents--but many of the volunteers have served with Bob from the beginning. “Bob’s passion for Angel Tree is contagious” admits Brad Bye who has often helped deliver gifts. This year he drove 150 miles north to Duluth Minnesota to deliver packages then he delivered 10 more in the Iron Range area of the state 50 miles farther north. Project Angel Tree sometimes makes long-distance delivery requests of Bob if there aren’t enough local churches to support the ministry. Delivering the presents has led to many memorable moments. Dave and Julie Hrbacek bring their children along to share the experience. John Zimmel who delivers presents with his wife Jo remembers one little boy in the second or third grade who was home alone when they arrived--and very excited to receive his gifts. Jim Cahill a long-time helper uses his contacts in the grocery industry to obtain generous discounts on turkeys that go along with the gifts. He remembers a delivery intended for three brothers two of whom were playing videogames with a friend when Jim arrived. When Jim asked ""Who wants a bible?"" the friend said he wanted it. Jim offered to pray with him and the boy accepted. When Jim prayed tears came to the boy's eyes. “Two minutes can change a life” says Jim. “Because we’ve been doing this so long I sometimes recognize the name of an 18-year-old child who was two years old when we first gave her an Angel Tree Christmas Tree present” Bob says. He adds that he is always moved by the written messages from incarcerated parents that go along with the gifts. “It’s a wonderful thing” says Ruth Jorgenson who helps call the guardians of the children ahead of time to get some understanding of their needs and wants. “We’re fortunate that we can help.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3080

About the ebook: The Second Vatican Council: Ecumenical and Apolitical is a short essay exploring two less-noticed aspects of the Council. The Council was ecumenical in the broadest sense of the term. Protestant and Orthodox observers were given places of honor in the Council sessions and treated as brothers united by a common baptism. New ecumenical connections and friendships formed at the Council helped open the way for major steps toward Christian unity in the second half of the 20th century. This same spirit of unity was also apparent in the Council Fathers' approach to decision-making. Rather than forming political factions and rivalries that jostled for position the Council Fathers worked together respectfully striving for unity of mind and heart. This led to some surprising results: virtual unanimity in many major decisions. Author Paul DeCelles writes ""Often the press at least the United States press reported on the Council as if it were a power struggle between progressives and conservatives. The Council was not however a factious political debate; it was rather an open sometimes sharp but always thoughtful exchange of ideas. That's part of the glory of the Council. Often people changed their minds. . . . It was a radically Christian way of doing things."" About the author: Paul DeCelles is a founding member of the People of Praise an ecumenical charismatic covenant Christian community headquartered in South Bend Indiana. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Johns Hopkins University and did research at Brookhaven National Laboratory the Institute for Advanced Study CERN and the University of Notre Dame.

3017,Nov. 30 2012 8:18 a.m.,Meadow View Soccer Team Racks Up Tournament Wins,Trinity cocaptain Ben Mysliwiec gains control of the ball. Photo: Lydia Eng. By Chris Meehan The boys’ varsity soccer team from Trinity at Meadow View made a surprising run through their state soccer tournament. The Trinity team knocked off two high-ranking teams before losing 1-0 in the semifinal game to North Cross High School one of the top teams in the country. With an 8-6-1 regular season record Trinity did not expect to make the tournament in the first place. But organizers offered Trinity the final spot in the Division II tournament for independent schools seeding them 12th out of 12 teams. “The tough schedule we played during the regular season must have caught their eye” says Meadow View athletic director Rick Schoof. In the first round they faced Denbigh Baptist the #5 seed. The game was a tactical defensive struggle with neither team scoring by the end of regulation play. Just seconds after the start of the second overtime cocaptain Ben Mysliwiec stole the ball dribbled it toward Denbigh’s goal and took a shot that ricocheted off the post and into the net ending the game. Final score: 1-0.  In round two they faced #4 seed The Covenant School. “We knew they were well-organized and would make us pay for any mistake we made” Coach Will Taylor said. After another defensive battle Trinity’s Santiago Ruiz scored on a counterattack chipping the ball over the goalie’s head with 11 minutes left to play. Final score: 1-0. North Cross High School Trinity’s opponent in the semifinal game was ranked 13th among all US high school soccer teams. North Cross fielded veteran players from Germany Spain and Zimbabwe--three of whom played on the Zimbabwean under-18 national team. “They were more skilled than us by far” Ben said.  The Trinity team gathers at halftime. In the first half North Cross controlled the style and pace of the game but Trinity also showed some heroics. While making a save Trinity goalkeeper P.J. Hasson dislocated his elbow but he popped it back in place and finished the game in pain. About five minutes before the half ended North Cross scored on a high shot to take the lead. At halftime Coach Taylor urged the team to put more pressure on the North Cross players and become more aggressive offensively. The team took his advice and generated several chances to score on counterattacks in the second half. “Finally with three and a half minutes remaining in the game we had our best chance to tie the game” says Coach Taylor. Trinity kicked the ball into the North Cross goal box. Cocaptain Brad Elliott found an alley through the tangle of players and took a shot which went just wide of the goal. The game ended with North Cross ahead 1-0. Around 70 students parents and faculty drove two hours and braved the chilly temperatures to support the Trinity team. “They just would not give up! They pushed hard played smart and looked out for one another” said parent Maria Elliot.“It was a fantastic moment that I’ll remember for a long time” added defensive player Andre Magill.The team includes more than half of the young men in the high school. “I’m so proud of them” says Coach Taylor. “They represented the school well on and off the field. It’s a great feeling of accomplishment.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3017
3010,Nov. 19 2012 8:40 a.m.,In Shreveport Reaching Out to Women,By Chris Meehan Women in the Shreveport branch are reaching out to their neighbors co-workers fellow parents—even their hairdressers—through a monthly gathering for sharing and sisterhood. “Our guests are good people who know we’re in the People of Praise but they don’t know many details about our life” explains Teresa Lynch one of the organizers. Natalia Bendele adds “We want to grow in love and friendship with these women because the Lord has placed them in our path but also because we want to give them the opportunity to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and see a bit of community life.” Once a month usually on a Saturday morning the guests and most of the 15 women in the branch come to Bill and Mary Frances Parker’s house from 10 to 11:30. After some conversation light food and drinks they gather in the living room for a talk and some planned and/or spontaneous sharings. Since July of 2011 about 27 guests have attended and over half have returned for more. One of the women has expressed a serious interest in coming underway. “It’s remarkably simple and remarkably successful” says branch leader Jack Lynch. Teresa Natalia Mary Frances Jackie Bertrand and Ruthanne Seitz plan the events. They’re flexible: the presentation might be a People of Praise teaching a general talk on prayer or a selection of stories that build faith. October’s gathering was merged with women’s night during the branch’s anniversary celebration. During that gathering CIM team members Laura Brummer and Jeanette Zimmel shared with one of the guests Gwen Stuart about life in the nearby Allendale neighborhood. “I’ve heard the story of your community’s work in Allendale but I never really understood it. As I listened tonight it all came into focus. My heart started burning and I knew I had to check it out” Gwen said. Invitations are generally sent via e-mail. Attendance varies: one month two guests; the next month 10. “Once I sent out an e-mail to the women who had never responded and offered to take them off the list” says Teresa. “Several asked to remain on it because they still hoped to attend someday.” “The gatherings have brought life to our branch” says Natalia. “They’re an answer to our prayer.” “After a year and a half we’re all quite happy with the results” adds Jack.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3010
2995,Oct. 31 2012 4:20 p.m.,Born of the Spirit,By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly Julius a 6’3’’ man with broad shoulders wearing sweatpants and a hoodie was pacing back and forth in his Evansville IN living room on a recent afternoon. He kept turning over a Scripture verse in his mind hoping to understand it--John 3:5: “Unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God.” As Julius was pacing missionaries Gianna Priolo David Zimmel and Ann Raway were parking their van in front of his house and walking up to the front porch. It was their first stop of the day. They knocked twice and got no answer. Then they saw that the van door was open so they hurried back to the street to shut it. “We were so excited to begin our mission work that we walked off and left the van door wide open” Gianna explains. That’s when Julius opened his front door and looked out so the missionaries rushed back up to his porch to meet him. “We’re Christian missionaries and God wanted us to knock on your door” David said. “Well come on in” Julius replied quickly opening the door wide. David noticed two Bibles on Julius’s couch one lying open. The missionaries began by sharing the word the Lord had given them to speak that day that fasting was a way to draw near to God. “I receive that word” Julius said with a gentle voice. He went on to tell them that just six weeks before after years of falling short of an earlier commitment to the Lord he had turned back to God and started going back to church. “But the Lord wants me to do something more” he added. “I don’t know what it is and I really want to find out what it is he wants.” When they asked him what Scripture verse he was reading Julius mentioned John 3. He’d been asked to run a Bible study on the passage but he didn’t know what to say because he didn’t understand what Jesus meant by “born of water and the Spirit.” David asked Julius what he knew about the Holy Spirit and the spiritual gifts reading the list from 1 Corinthians 12. Julius listened closely and said he had already been asking God for two of the gifts: knowledge and wisdom. They explained at some length about baptism in the Holy Spirit and offered to pray with him on the spot. “I would like that” Julius said. “Julius dropped down on one knee and bowed his head for us to pray with him” David recalls. The missionaries led him through a prayer committing himself to God renouncing the attractions of the devil and inviting the Holy Spirit into his life. They shared several words from the Lord for Julius and after each he responded “I accept that.” As the missionaries left Julius told David “I believe God sent you. It’s not an accident what you said; it came from the Lord.” He and David exchanged phone numbers and have been in contact several times. David said that the missionaries hadn’t been to Julius’s neighborhood for a year or more. Julius’s house on the corner was the first and only one they knocked on in the area that day.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2995
2983,Oct. 31 2012 4:18 p.m.,In Muncie Brotherhood in the Outdoors,Eighty-five men and boys camped at Mary Gray Bird Sanctuary in mid-October. Photo by Greg Walters By Chris Meehan with reporting by Justin Walters Eighty-five men and boys enjoyed a weekend of brotherhood and outdoor fun at the Muncie branch’s 33rd annual campout in mid-October. “What began in 1979 as a father-son campout pioneered by Ron Mixell has evolved into a yearly gathering for men and boys” explains Muncie scoutmaster Peter Walters. (The gathering is organized by the branch’s boy scout troop.) This year in addition to scouts and their dads the men from the Indianapolis Christians in Mission team joined the campout as well as several alumni of the troop. They camped at the Mary Gray Bird Sanctuary a 700-acre nature preserve about an hour southeast of Muncie. Campers enjoyed archery boxing hikes marksmanship (with pellet guns) prayer skits and personal testimonies. Part of Saturday was devoted to a skills competition among the four patrols in the boy scout troop a chance to develop and display their abilities in archery fire-building and orienteering. Fourteen-year old Conner Davis said a highlight of his weekend was the annual re-telling of the Mary Gray ghost story especially watching the faces of younger boys who were hearing the story for the first time. Nathan Osner (15) was grateful for the opportunity the weekend gave him to advance in the scouting program. “I love the fellowship and the Christ-centered culture here at camp” added Josh Shirey who works in sales in Muncie and has a son Noah in the troop. Brothers in the People of Praise such as Bill Bolka and Henry Peresie (both Muncie) and Terry Bomkamp (Rockford) as well as Peter’s sons Justin (Mission Division Indianapolis) and Greg have assisted Peter in running the event for years. Recently a group of fathers and scout leaders—some in the People of Praise some not—have coalesced into an informal men’s group that also make a large contribution of time and energy to the event. “We are unabashedly Christian in our approach to scouting” Peter says. Jim Schenkel Muncie’s principal branch coordinator spent Saturday with the men. He says “Now that most of our own sons have grown we’re happy to give scouting dads the chance to relax and have fun with their sons. For some of them it’s their first introduction to who we are as a community. We hope to continue this tradition for many years.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2983
2945,Sept. 21 2012 3:56 p.m.,Servant Branch: Four Make the Covenant of the People of Praise,"Beth Fondell Mary Reinhardt Mark Olson and Matt Brickweg. (Photo credit: Karen Coleman.) Four underway members of Servant Branch made the covenant of the People of Praise at the community meeting on September 9. Matt Brickweg and Mary Reinhardt grew up in the community and Mark Olson and Beth Fondell first learned about the People of Praise from the persons they later married. Below are brief biographies of these newly covenanted members along with excerpts from the sharings they gave at the meeting. Beth Fondell Beth (54) works at the University of Minnesota in a research center focused on improving policies and services for those with disabilities. She and her husband Chuck Shreffler a longtime covenanted member of the community are members of Hope Presbyterian Church in Richfield MN. Beth says “My husband Chuck is the primary reason I am standing up here today. “About 13 years ago I had just returned from a trip with a friend who had joined a Christian community living among the poor in Los Angeles. I was telling Chuck about my hunger to live my life in an ecumenical Christian community. I noticed tears in his eyes as I shared my heart’s desire. My friendship with Chuck was still quite new and it became apparent that day that he knew something about living in Christian community!  Mary Reinhardt signs the covenant book. (Photo credit: Andy Bowar.) Initially though I resisted developing a connection with the People of Praise. Sustaining that resistance became an exercise in futility however. I was captivated by Chuck’s account of all the loving overtures that brothers in the community had made to him during some tough times in his life. When Chuck and I became engaged these same brothers and their spouses surrounded us with so much celebration! I was humbled by their ability to welcome me. Over the past 12 years I have acquired my own accounts of sisters lovingly coming alongside me with prayer and wisdom as I strove to live the Lord’s calling in marriage stepparenting ecumenism and now in the People of Praise. Over time God has shown me how he has been beautifully aligning the circumstances of my life and the desires of my heart to bring me to the place of confidently and very joyfully making this commitment to all of you today. Thank you all for loving me into this covenant life.” Matt Brickweg Matt (25) sells heating and air-conditioning systems for Honeywell. He attended Trinity School at River Ridge participated in Servant Branch’s Action division and spent five years in its campus division. He currently lives in St. Paul. One night as a member of the Company a leadership development program for young men in the community Matt spent an evening discussing the covenant studying it line by line. He says “I remember going to sleep that night completely stirred up with a new love for community and for the Lord. I realized how incredible radical and revolutionary the idea of the covenant is. We can make a commitment to one another and to the Father that says we'll take care of one another in all needs at every stage of life. ""When I got invited to make the covenant this summer I thought What is the world going to look like even 50 years from now? As I was praying I heard the Father say It doesn't matter. Covenant love will see us through the same way it has since the first 29 folks made the covenant all those years ago.""    Mark Olson gives his sharing standing next to Joel Kibler right. (Photo credit: Andy Bowar.) Mark Olson Mark (45) works in sales for an appliance parts distributor. In 2006 he married Servant Branch member Julie Kadera becoming a stepfather to Julie's son Chris. He says “I was born into a Christian home with two parents and a twin sister Melissa. When my sister and I were 10 we lost our mother who had a congenital heart defect. On the day she died I woke to my father screaming. I went into my parents’ room and saw my Dad trying to give my Mom CPR. By the time the ambulance got there it was too late. “My Dad said that after that I turned inward . At 11 years old I took my first drink and from then until nine years ago alcohol consumed me. On May 10 2002 I hit rock bottom. One of the worst memories I have is the thought of my father and sister out looking for me and not knowing where I was or even if I was alive. That day I reached out to God and asked him for a better way. I didn’t want to cause my father any more pain. “Fast-forwarding a few years on April 27 2003 I had my first date with a great lady Julie Kadera. From the beginning of our relationship Julie shared about all of you and about her growing up in the People of Praise. Because of Julie and Chris living out Christ’s example I was curious to see what community might mean for me. After Julie made the covenant I asked her if she would come with me on a Community Weekend. ""Rubbing elbows with all of you keeps me accountable to God's call on my life and allows me to stay committed to being a light in his world. I want to tell all of you how very blessed I am to have you and how much I appreciate your commitment to me.""   Mary Reinhardt Mary (23) is a pediatric nurse at the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital. She grew up in the Minneapolis suburb of Burnsville surrounded by nine siblings and the children of about 30 community families. She currently lives in household with John and Jen Theis. “When I joined Action and began to learn more about our work in the Mississippi River Valley I became more and more interested in giving my whole life to the Lord. I began to see my life as a huge opportunity to love and serve the Lord in everything that I did. Being a part of our campus division gave me the opportunity to live with and learn from so many Spirit-filled and holy people! When I was asked to consider making the covenant this year my heart was so moved to say “Yes!” I feel called to spend the rest of my life with the people I've encountered in the People of Praise who are all so genuine and persistent in their pursuit of the Father and his will. The love that we share in our life together made possible through the covenant is truly the type of love the world needs in order to bring God's kingdom here on earth and I want to be a part of it!”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2945
2932,Sept. 3 2012 10 a.m.,Hurricane Isaac Update,"By Chris Meehan All 63 men women and children in the New Orleans branch appear to have come through Hurricane Isaac in fine shape says Lloyd Mehaffey the branch’s principal branch coordinator. Hurricane Isaac which was downgraded to a tropical storm late on Wednesday night brought 80-mile-an-hour winds and up to two feet of rain to some areas of Southern Louisiana. Flooding occurred in areas to the north and to the south of most branch members who were protected from high waters by levees. In Mobile Alabama branch member Donna Ganzarain reported “We were getting beat up by three days of rain but we’re all OK. Nobody got flooded out and nobody lost power.” In Biloxi Mississippi Dede Schneider said ""We had heavy rain for a few days but it didn't have much negative effect."" Community members in Shreveport reported a brief period of intense rain but little disruption as Isaac passed by. Only five New Orleans branch members left the area because of the storm reports area coordinator Phil Slattery and that was simply to avoid anticipated power outages. Phil estimates that about a third of the branch eventually lost electricity before the slow-moving storm ended its three-day stay. “Everybody was looking out for one another” he says noting that the Arguses Coneys and Valerios each hosted branch families who had lost power for a night or two this week. Downed trees caused much of the interruption in power in New Orleans. John and Christine Barnitz who had evacuated to their daughter’s home in Georgia had a large tree fall by their house but only a few branches fell on the roof appearing to cause no serious damage.  “In short” says Phil “members of our branch suffered only minor damage for which we can thank the Lord.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2932
2929,Sept. 3 2012 9:42 a.m.,Two Are Cancer-Free After Prayer,By Chris MeehanTwo retirees are cancer-free after members of the Sisterhood prayed over them at the Sisterhood’s home in Elkhart Indiana.  Polly Gobis and Byron Johnson Byron Johnson 80 divides his time between Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and Englewood Florida. He’s a friend and fishing buddy of Dave Farabaugh a fellow retiree who used to spend winters in Florida but now lives year-round in Elkhart. Dave is the father of Nano Farabaugh who heads the Sisterhood and lives in the Sisterhood household next door to Dave’s home. Two years ago Byron stopped by to see Dave on his way down to Florida. Over dinner he shared some bad news with Dave Nano and the other members of the Sisterhood household: “I have prostate cancer.” The cancer had not metastasized but appeared self-contained. Several doctors had laid out treatment options involving radiation chemotherapy or surgery but on the advice of a doctor at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa he’d begun to receive hormone therapy treatments at four-month intervals. Nano and her housemates offered to pray right then and there. When Byron relates the story of what happened next—and he says he’s told the story many times over the last two years—he never fails to choke up. “I had a religious experience” he tells Nano in an interview conducted for this article. “When you all prayed for me something was going on inside of me I’d never experienced before. It’s really hard to explain. It was . . . fantastic! Yeah . . . It was tremendous. Tears came to my eyes and I felt so blessed.” After that prayer two years ago Byron continued to Tampa for an annual check up which included an MRI. Later when the doctor showed him the results Byron asked “Where is the cancer?” “It’s gone” the doctor replied. When Byron explained that he had been prayed with the doctor told him that prayer often works. As a precaution the doctor also urged Byron to continue his hormone therapy which he did. “I was healed. It was miraculous” Byron says. An MRI in February 2012 also revealed no trace of cancer. In early August Byron visited Dave and the Sisterhood again to tell them about the healing bringing along Polly Gobis who was traveling with him to Florida. Polly explained that she had recently developed suspicious spots on her lungs as well as signs that the skin cancer on her scalp she had previously battled had returned. Again Sisterhood members offered to pray. Polly went to the Moffitt Cancer Center on Friday August 17 and learned that the spots on her lungs were just nodules and that her scalp was free of cancer. “Do I think the Lord healed me? Absolutely! There’s no doubt in my mind” she says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2929
2913,Aug. 25 2012 1:25 p.m.,Servant Camp: Attendance Swells As Many Branches Join In the Fun,"Story by Chris Meehan. Photos by Andy Bowar. Click here to view a musical slideshow on the Servant Camp web site.Nearly 400 campers and counselors from eight branches of the People of Praise came together near Cannon Falls Minnesota in early August for Servant Camp. This year’s camp was the largest in a decade thanks to an infusion of 97 people who made the trek northward from South Bend along with a handful of campers who came from Appleton Colorado Springs Muncie Rockford northern Virginia and Saskatoon. “It was a fabulous week” says camp director Pat Ficker (Servant Branch). He says one of his personal highlights was a time of singing at the camp’s closing meal. “I don’t know if I’ve seen a more joyful place in my life. The kids all had smiles on their faces and young and old were singing camp songs together. There was a little chaos but it was as close to the kingdom of God as I’ve ever experienced.” The camp included young children—first- and second-graders who came to camp during the day and returned home at night—all the way up to high school juniors and seniors who served as assistant counselors. Paul Rice (Saskatoon) 15 has been coming since he was a first-grader. He said he liked the skits and the sharings around the campfire. ""I felt that the spiritual part of camp was stronger this year now that my group has matured."" Fifteen-year-old Mary Raway (Servant Branch) says she made three good friends her age from South Bend and also appreciated kayaking and shooting model rockets. “This year’s camp was livelier” she says. Dietrich Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) 14 another veteran says his age group had only four guys from Servant Branch but adding campers from other branches brought his group up to 10. Additional campers also meant more couples for the swing dance class that Dietrich and other older campers enjoyed. There were plenty more activities. Aidan Couch (South Bend) 11 liked the climbing tower; Anna Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) 12 appreciated the ropes course. Activities also included archery riflery  swimming a nightly sharing time around the campfire and a campwide game based on the television program Let’s Make a Deal. For many like Ben Maslow (Servant Branch) 12 Jacob Heintzelman (South Bend) 10 and assistant camp director Jeanne Oberg (Servant Branch) the closing ceremony with its quiet procession and sharings about encounters with the Lord during the week was a high point of the week. Chris Newburn (Rockford) wrote a song about this year’s camp theme “Whom shall I send?” and campers sang it often during the week. Celeste Dal Pra (Rockford) has been coming to Servant Camp for 15 years. This year she came with her daughters Juliana 22 Emilia 17 and Mariana 14. Celeste says that it's a big deal to come from a smaller branch to spend a week in a larger community setting. ""Servant Camp is a great community experience. For my kids going to Servant Camp is like it was for me as a young person going to conferences in South Bend in the late '70s. It's mind blowing to see that there are so many other committed Christians out there."" The addition of campers from South Bend came about after leaders in South Bend and Servant Branch noticed a demographic decline that would produce fewer children coming to both camps in the future. The two branches decided to join forces creating a camp that took advantage of Servant Camp’s location at Phillippo Scout Reservation and a very experienced staff while blending in some traditions developed at South Bend’s camp over the years. (These included an ongoing skit at daily flags a morning news report and a group of young men who led the campers in boisterous spirit-lifting song in the dining hall after meals.) John and Mary Behrens (South Bend) spent many hours planning the logistics of transporting the South Bend campers. They and other South Bend camp mainstays such as Larry Day and Roy Somerville joined the Servant Camp staff. Mary Sgroi 12 and her sister Lucia 10 both commented on how comfortable and enjoyable the bus ride was. “I was excited on the way there and looking forward to coming home on the way back” added nine-year-old Ben Zusi. It was a week of fun and making friends that campers counselors and leaders all appreciated. “It was wonderful and unifying” says Pat. “It was an experiment that was really blessed” John Behrens added.” A number of younger campers from Servant Branch put it this way: “It was a blast!”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2913
2892,Aug. 16 2012 9:42 a.m.,Ecumenical Effort Brings Health Care to Portland Neighbors,"By Chris Meehan  Around 600 guests and volunteers came to Roosevelt High School for the Compassion North Portland Event on August 4. The Vancouver/Portland branch joined with 25 churches and organizations on Saturday August 4 in an ecumenical effort to provide free medical care to North Portland-area residents. Organizers estimate that more than 300 guests and 300 volunteers came to Roosevelt High School for the Compassion North Portland event. Some guests arrived at 3:30 a.m. to receive basic dental exams tooth extractions eye exams routine physicals—and even haircuts. “We joined this effort in order to get to know and love our neighbors in North Portland but also to get to know other Christians in the area who have a mission to the neighborhood"" says principal branch coordinator Charlie Fraga. Charlie described one of his personal highlights during the day. ""I met a young man whose glasses were smashed in a mugging last April. He said he had very bad eyes but hadn’t been able to get glasses since the mugging. Later in the day I saw him with glasses on. ‘I’m so happy’ he said. ‘I can’t tell you what you guys have done for me today!' He was practically dancing.” Luke Glover (Vancouver/Portland) who led the parking and security team said he found a line of people already waiting when he arrived at 5:45 a.m.  The temperature soared to 100 degrees during the day but many waited patiently to set up appointments with dental general medical or optical specialists and filled out paperwork during their waits to speed things along. Before and after their individual appointments guests could browse through 41 booths staffed by workers from social service agencies such as the American Diabetes Association WorkForce Oregon and Catholic Charities. Linda Jo Devlaeminck (Vancouver/Portland) helped organize the booths. “I learned as I went along” she says. “I had no clue what the job was going to look like when I started.” (She adds that she’d happily do it again.) Her team provided maps indicating where specific booths were located and color-coded the tablecloths according to the type of service offered.  When the opportunity arose Linda Jo asked guests which booths were most helpful to them. One man there with his family said through an interpreter “Every booth was helpful!”  Carole Richardson (left) served on the child care team. Photo: Betsy Lance. Six vans organized by Fred Dang (Vancouver/Portland) transported guests to off-site dental appointments. (Other appointments were held at the school.) Mike Freeman (Vancouver/Portland) produced promotional materials for use before and after the event and joined the prayer team along with several members of his men’s group. They interceded for the event regularly beforehand and sat in various public spots that day praying with anyone who asked and praying for prayer requests that guests had submitted in writing. Ann Martinez (Vancouver/Portland) recruited and organized 20 people to serve as translators primarily for Hispanic guests. “I was struck by the humility of all the volunteers I met. They were willing to work hard and dove right in” she said. All told more than 50 branch members helped plan organize or execute the event and branch volunteers led seven of the 15 planning committees. David Brewer one of Compassion North Portland’s primary organizers said he appreciated all the help from the People of Praise. “I have been deeply impressed with the commitment level of the folks in the People of Praise. That commitment showed in the financial investment in leadership and volunteers. And the spirit of service and collaboration has been tremendous to experience.” After their appointments guests filled out forms and went through exit interviews. Organizers are collating the information and will be distributing names of willing guests to some of the churches and other groups for follow-up. Charlie asked for 15 names for the branch. “We’ll see whom the Lord brings to us” he says.  Mark Ronayne (Vancouver/Portland left) and Jerome Devlaeminck (Vancouver/Portland) enjoy their lunchtime break. Photo: Naomi Shreves He adds that the event was a big success from an ecumenical point of view. “Christians from different denominations have gotten to know one another and the key leaders all seem to share a natural desire to collaborate to respect and support one another in spite of their wide range of Christian backgrounds.” Charlie says the leaders will be meeting soon to discuss possible next steps if any. “I'm looking forward to being part of that conversation.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2892
2869,Aug. 7 2012 7:19 p.m.,Ten Years of Community Life in Allendale,"By Chris Meehan with reporting by Claire Holovaty. Photos by Ellen Putzier Edna Malone and Sam Mertz.About 100 neighbors and Action volunteers gathered to celebrate 10 years of People of Praise life in Shreveport’s Allendale neighborhood on August 2. A banner hanging above the empty lot where they met for prayer and food offered a theme taken from the Scriptures—We are all one in Christ Jesus (Gal. 3:28). The celebration included a praise dance by neighborhood girls and a barbecue and potluck. Christians in Mission team leader Nathan Barrett stood on a chair and offered some reflections on unity. “When we pray together we become more one in Christ” he said “and that helps the whole neighborhood and the whole world.” He urged neighbors to commit to praying the Lord's Prayer with someone else that week. Some Allendale residents at the celebration had seen the community’s presence in the neighborhood grow over 10 years beginning with a few men living in a rental house and slowly expanding to a team of 20 men women and children living in six new homes built by volunteers. Neighbors offered their reflections on what the People of Praise has meant to the area. “The People of Praise has made a big difference” said Diane Burks who met community members soon after they arrived in 2002. “I sit on my porch and watch the boys at summer camp. The People of Praise members give kids respect patience and love. And they get respect back. This is what we’ve needed. I hope the People of Praise stays for a long time. “People of Praise members listen when you talk to them” she added. “They don’t just quote Scripture. They explain it.” “Father make us one. That’s my favorite prayer” said long-time Allendale resident Ed Allison echoing Nathan’s message. “There used to be a cultural division but that’s been broken down. This is God’s work. The People of Praise are my best friends.” Neighbor Angie Simmons said “The People of Praise has brought a lot of people together—for Bible study and prayer nights. There used to be a lot of fighting—now you don’t see that. They taught my son how to build a doghouse and they keep my boys out of trouble. The People of Praise has a friend in me.” Since 2002 the community has sent 49 volunteer teams to Allendale. Volunteers have donated 60000 hours of labor built six new homes on Yale Avenue completed 65 home-repair projects for neighbors and organized 10 years of summer camps for local children. Shreveport branch members helped house feed and entertain many of the volunteers. “At times it’s been a stretch for a small branch like us to do all that” says branch leader Jack Lynch “but it gives us life. Action’s presence energizes us.” Joan Pingel who moved from South Bend to Shreveport in 2004 says that some neighborhood changes are not easily measured. “Time is the key to some changes” she says. “Even some folks that haven’t been so friendly respect us because we’ve stuck it out. They know where to turn if they’re in trouble or where to send a friend in need.”  The barbecue also marked the end of this year’s summer camp. The camp set a record for attendance when 62 campers came on June 29. Most days about 40 children attended. Campers enjoyed a day of Olympic-themed events to wrap up this year’s camp. The activities included opening ceremonies featuring flags and the lighting of a torch which campers relayed around the neighborhood. Games included relay races and a “soak your counselor” event along with football basketball-dribbling long jump a bean bag toss and jump rope. At the closing ceremony the girls resurrected an ancient Greek tradition called ""The Path of Victory."" The girls on the winning team wore red ribbons around their heads and walked through two rows of girls tossing flowers before them. Colleen Murray who led the girls’ activities noted that the camp ran very smoothly. “I think the girls have been coming long enough that they know what kind of behavior we expect” she said. Sam Mertz who directed the boys’ section of camp said that this year’s campers were more willing to be reconciled after a disagreement than in his two previous summers as a counselor. “They’ll do it—even if they resist at first. What we’ve been teaching has been sinking in over time.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2869
2842,July 21 2012 11:32 a.m.,First Indianapolis Camp Draws 20 Children,Photos by Trish Brewer. Story by Chris Meehan. The community’s first day camp on the South Side of Indianapolis wrapped up at the end of June. Action volunteers and Christians in Mission (CIM) team members worked together to pull off the eight-day camp for over 20 children. They held the camp primarily on vacant property owned by members of the South Side CIM team. Campers made root beer from scratch launched water balloons from a slingshot performed Bible skits and completed service projects in the neighborhood. “The size of the group was about what we expected and planned for” says CIM team leader Michael Coney. “Through camp we met several new children and their families and learned more about the family situations of several kids we already knew. It was a step forward for our efforts to build community on the South Side.” Jo Zimmel (Servant Branch) directed the camp. She is a long-time physical education teacher who helped develop the community’s camp in Allendale. Each day she brainstormed with camp staff then planned activities for each group of boys and each group of girls. She says the only real surprise came when the root beer the girls made came out clear instead of the usual brown color. (They used a different variety of root beer extract from the one she has used elsewhere. The clear root beer still tasted fine.) “One feature we kept from Allendale Camp is the Human School Bus—having the camp staff walk to the children’s houses to pick them up and drop them off so no one walks alone” she says. “Sometimes in their walks the kids we invited yelled out to their friends and invited them to come along.” Each day of the camp had a scriptural theme and often an activity that complemented the theme. After learning about David and Goliath the boys used a slingshot to launch water balloons at a large cardboard Goliath. The girls’ staff performed a skit for them called “Danielle and the Scary Sleepover” an adaptation of the story of Daniel in the lions’ den. Campers also painted a fence and swept the street in preparation for a neighborhood block party. After the camp ended CIM team member Jen Torma asked one nine-year-old boy if he’d be interested in coming back again some time. “I’d be crazy not to” he said.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2842
2816,July 14 2012 7:42 p.m.,Colorado Springs Fire Update,"Branch members Phil and Carol Ehemann and Keith and Cathy Houin helped dig through the rubble at a home owned by members of their church. ""We found very little other than burned fragments of books and other items"" Phil says. ""Our friend had hundreds of dollars in old silver coins. They melted into globs of silver like very large pieces of melted solder."" By Elizabeth Grams The Waldo Canyon fire still smolders outside Colorado Springs but community brothers and sisters and many other residents who left their homes have returned safely. On Tuesday night firefighters capitalizing on favorable weather conditions finally contained the fire which had burned 346 houses on the city’s western edge. No homes owned by community members suffered any significant damage. “This fire will affect the city for a quite a long time” says branch leader Pat Hrbacek. “It’s incredible that it didn't do more damage. The fire demonstrates the power of nature but also the power of the Lord.” “God’s hand was on us” adds Jennifer Ortiz whose Mountain Shadows neighborhood was hit hard. On the night the fire moved through she was out of town with her family. “I just lay in bed and praised God. I didn’t know if our house was going to burn but I knew God was going to be with me and I’d get through it.” Phil and Carol Ehemann had left their house in a hurry with their two visiting grandchildren. “The grandkids were pretty scared” Phil says. “It was almost like night the smoke was so thick. The sun was a red disk like a science fiction movie. We were out of our house for three days. Twenty-four families from our church lost houses.” Jennifer says that area residents have been extremely generous since the devastation. “There have been benefit concerts meals every day for people who lost homes churches asking people to stop bringing donations. Everywhere you drive there are signs: ‘Thank you law enforcement'; ‘Thank you first responders.’” Branch members have already been helping friends and neighbors and Pat Hrbacek says they are thinking and praying about how to continue to help over the long haul as people get back on their feet after the fire. “It’s going to take time” he says.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2816
2807,July 14 2012 7:42 p.m.,DC-Area Power Outages Produce Common Life,"by Chris Meehan A tree that fell down during the storm took down powerlines and two utility poles with it. (Photo: woodleywonderworks.) Violent thunderstorms rocked the Washington DC area on June 29 bringing lengthy power outages to more than 50 community households. They were among 1.4 million area residents who lost electricity. Northern Virginia branch members banded together through outages that lasted from one to five days. Those with electricity offered their freezers places at their kitchen tables and spare bedrooms to those in need. The storm came amid a heat wave that broke records and included four straight days of temperatures over 100 degrees. Ten DC-area residents died from weather-related factors following the storm. “By the Lord’s grace we were spared serious damage or injury” says area coordinator Terry Cassell. “In fact for many of us the week had a silver lining—it provided us with a great experience of community living.” The storm hit the area about 10:30 p.m. on Friday night just a few hours after two buses of children and adults had returned from Buffalo Camp. Travel immediately became dangerous due to blinding rain nonfunctioning traffic signals falling branches and downed power lines. Jon Cassady was working late the night of the storm and noticed the lightning so he began to drive home. He says he was forced to crawl along at 10 mph which meant he could spot a huge tree branch just before it fell on the road. “I might’ve been seriously hurt"" he says. Clean up crews on the move. (photo: Arlington County.) On Saturday Bill and Barbette Brophy faced the task of every household without power--saving what food they could from the slowly warming refrigerator and freezer. They considered putting some of it in Bruce and Anita Brand’s large freezer but they suspected it might be needed by other community neighbors (it was). Instead they took their food to a relative's home. Later in the day the Brands had the Brophys over for a Lord’s Day meal. Eileen Pizer who didn't lose power says she was happy to move a group Lord’s Day meal to her apartment on short notice after Julie Conroy lost power. She also invited several women to spend the night in her air-conditioned home. (Two of them did.) “I tried to invite more but I couldn’t get through to them because the phone service was so sketchy” she says. Phone systems failed and cell phones were unreliable for several days. Laurie Magill says she was moved by the way the branch coordinators immediately began assessing who might need help. “It wasn't an easy job” she says “with the phones not working well.” There were other logistical challenges. When Bill Brophy went out to buy coffee he found most of the McDonald's and Starbucks stores were closed due to lack of power. The ones that were open had long lines and purchases had to be made in cash because credit- and debit-card machines had stopped working. Gas stations and grocery stores were either closed or had limited supplies long lines and a cash requirement. Branch members said it was difficult to make plans because no one knew when the power would return. Kathy Temeles’s power was off for three days came back on then went off twice the next day. After the power came on at her workplace she went in to charge her cell phone. “Thank God I had just gotten some cash before the storm hit” she said “but I had to wait an hour in line at each of the two restaurants I ate at that week. I'm grateful the Ridenours had me over to dinner a couple times.” Rick Ridenour notes that offering hospitality had its benefits. During the most difficult days Frank and Carolyn Bassett came to stay with them. “After Carolyn returned home she had a Thanksgiving-in-July meal for us to cook a turkey that was taking up a lot of freezer space” he says. ""It was great!"" While they were out of power Tom and Therese McNichol received so many dinner invitations they had to turn some down. Therese called to mind a recent prophecy she had given at a branch meeting in which the Lord called members to put more of their lives in common. “It looks to me like he gave us a way to do that!”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2807

2669,June 28 2012 11:39 a.m.,As Colorado Wildfires Rage Branch Members Gather to Pray,"by Elizabeth Grams and Sean Connolly  Colorado Springs June 26 2012. (U.S. Air Force photo/Mike Kaplan) As the massive Waldo Canyon wildfire raged on the edges of Colorado Springs branch members gathered at Pat and Kara Hrbacek’s home Wednesday night to pray for their city and region. Everyone in the branch is safe and unharmed but 10 brothers and sisters left their homes this week to avoid the encroaching blaze. Evacuees include Judy Allgeyer Phil and Carol Ehemann Keith and Cathy Houin Bren and Karen Triplett Sean and Kellee White and Jon Grams. (Jon has already returned home.) By Wednesday night branch member Jennifer Ortiz had heard no official word on whether her home had survived after the fire spread to the Mountain Shadows neighborhood where it burned at least 300 houses. John and Katherine Brophy who live outside the burned area own a rental house next door to the Ortizes and were also awaiting word on its status on Wednesday afternoon. The Ortizes learned of the fire early in the week while on vacation in the Washington D.C. area. Before a mandatory evacuation order was enforced in Mountain Shadows branch members pulled some of the Ortizes' valuables from their house and covered it with tarps to protect it from flying embers. ""We're just so grateful to everybody for their help and prayers"" Jennifer says. Events took a turn for the worse on Tuesday afternoon when 65 mph winds caused the fire to leap over a ridge and move toward occupied areas. Kelly McMullen took in evacuee Judy Allgeyer on Tuesday evening. “I was still up around 12:30 when a strong waft of smoke came through the open windows"" Kelly says. ""I went outside and walked near Cragmor Christian Reformed Church where we have our branch meetings looking to the west to see if the flames were getting worse. I found four other neighbors doing the same thing. You could hear sirens in the distance a constant background noise.” Kelly spent Wednesday glued to the news reports on TV. “Even the calm among us are watchful as we pray for safety and deliverance from the danger."" Sean and Kellee White put on breathing masks and Sean handed out spare masks to neighbors as they packed their truck and van full of possessions amid thick smoke prior to leaving their home on Tuesday. The Whites and their five children are staying with Rick and Betty Busekrus. “Not knowing when or if we'll be able to go home is strange” Kellee says. “But we’re just trusting in the Lord.” The Ehemanns had to move out the same afternoon along with several relatives who are visiting Colorado Springs for a family reunion planned for this coming weekend. Keith and Cathy Houin stopped by Judy Allgeyer's house before they left the neighborhood to make sure she was taken care of. The Triplett family voluntarily left their home on Sunday. All three families are staying with friends in the city. Jon Grams left his Manitou Springs home south west of the city early in the week but as the fire moved north he was able to return home in time to assist the Whites with their evacuation. “It will take dozens of years for vegetation to come back in burned areas” he says pointing to one of the fire's long-term effects on the city. Kelly McMullen noted a number of ways Colorado Springs residents are pulling together offering rooms to strangers fleeing the fire and praying publicly for the safety of all. “The whole city is acting like community” she said. “I know the urge to pray for rain is strong but rain usually comes with wind here and so what we really need is stillness. If the wind is still the fire will spread more slowly. Firefighting planes can’t fly when the winds are high.” Branch leader Pat Hrbacek could see the smoke and fire moving down toward occupied areas from his office on Tuesday afternoon. “Branch members are looking out for one another” he says. “People are good at getting on the phone and checking in. The hardest part was confirming that everyone was okay. Kevin Ranaghan (South Bend) has been sending out email updates and knowing that people are praying for us is very comforting. It means a lot to everybody here. “Pray that the people of Colorado Springs especially the evacuees will be able to get through this time with some peace knowing that the Lord will take care of their homes and take care of them. Pray against fear and anxiety and pray for the Lord’s guidance in terms of what we can do in our own neighborhoods to help rebuild wherever rebuilding is needed.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2669
2652,June 22 2012 4:30 p.m.,Two-Year-Old Healed in Evansville,"by Chris Meehan A persistent rash disappeared from the legs and face of MaKiya Cooper a two-year-old girl from Evansville IN after People of Praise missionaries prayed with her in late May. MaKiya's mother Brandi Cooper says she had taken MaKiya to three doctors over nine days without finding a cure for the raised purple blotches on MaKiya's legs and face near her lips and nose. Two hours after the missionaries prayed with MaKiya the rash was gone. Missionaries Evan Lent Ellen Reed and Dan Schwab a visitor from Servant Branch first met MaKiya and Brandi late in the day on May 23. ""It was about time to head back home but when we saw a group of people outdoors in front of a white two-story house Evan suggested we stop"" Dan recalls. The missionaries began a conversation with Brandi her sister Cathy and two men. MaKiya hung on to her mother as she rested her on her hip while several other children ran around the small front porch and front yard. Cathy mentioned that they were Christians and she shared some thoughts about their neighborhood--the missionaries live nearby. She also mentioned MaKiya's rash. Before the missionaries left everyone laid hands on MaKiya for a brief prayer but nothing unusual seemed to happen. Afterward Brandi took MaKiya to Walmart to buy some anti-itch cream. During the shopping trip she looked down at her daughter and noticed that her skin was clear and smooth. She snapped a picture of her daughter with her phone and sent it to Cathy with the news that the rash was gone. Cathy and one of the men ran down the block to tell the missionaries. Cathy didn't pause to put on her shoes. “We were eating dinner in the men’s house and we heard a knock on the door” says Ellen. “Nick Holovaty got up and went into the entryway to see who it was. As Cathy started to tell the story. Evan recognized her voice got up and greeted her and invited her in.” “It was you and you and you that prayed” she said with a smile pointing out Evan then Ellen and Dan. “I was so excited that MaKiya got healed I hurried over right away to tell you."" “Cathy showed us the picture of MaKiya on her phone” says Evan. “She knew God had done it.” Evan has maintained contact with the family and reports that nearly a month later MaKiya's rash has not returned.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2652

2559,June 14 2012 10:43 a.m.,104 Seniors Graduate from Trinity Schools,"by Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly   Meadow View graduates (from left:) Peter Ballou (back to camera) David Katcher Grace Feeks Julia DeCelles-Zwerneman Abby Kahler Sarah Loughran With hymns speeches tears and cheers 104 high school seniors picked up their diplomas and wrapped up their time at Trinity School on Saturday June 9. Their graduations took place within a few hours of each other on the three campuses of Trinity School: in Falls Church VA Eagan MN and South Bend IN. In her valedictory at the Meadow View campus graduate award winner Julia DeCelles-Zwerneman compared graduation day to a moment in the development of a human embryo termed “gastrulation.” The embryo at seven to ten days old reforms itself into three layers: primitive versions of the human digestive system nervous system and the muscular and circulatory systems. The embryo also takes on a surprising shape--that of a doughnut. ""This day is very much like the day we became doughnuts"" Julia told her fellow graduates. ""On that day we were being equipped with the physical tools necessary to function as human beings. Today marks the day we are finally equipped with the intellectual and spiritual tools necessary to begin our work for Christ."" In May Meadow View's senior class raised more than $6000 for International Justice Mission (IJM) a human rights group that frees modern-day slaves. (The money covered the costs of freeing one slave according to IJM.) At graduation they were treated to a speech by Bill Clark IJM's vice-president for advancement. Since 27 million people are currently living as slaves he said Trinity graduates are ""entering a world that is desperate for courageous and Christlike leaders."" The commencement ceremony at River Ridge took on both somber and celebratory tones. The graduates remembered Alex Maslow son of Mike and Kathy Maslow (Servant Branch) who died in the summer of 2010 and would have graduated from River Ridge this year. Another River Ridge student Johnny McClure a sophomore and brother of one of the graduates died unexpectedly in his sleep last November.  River Ridge head of school Jon Balsbaugh with Graduate Award winners Meg Thompson and Joshua Koletar In his valedictory graduate award winner Joshua Koletar reflected on Alex's death and on the limits of human reason: ""[After Alex's death] I tried to rely upon my reason to comprehend my world and it failed me."" When reason comes up short Joshua said love offers a way forward. ""Through the grace of God we have been equipped with a capacity to transcend reason. This capacity is our ability to love. . . . Love sustains us in our direst circumstances and connects us with something greater than ourselves."" This year is also the 25th anniversary of the River Ridge campus and Kerry Koller (South Bend) president and one of the founders of Trinity Schools came to River Ridge to mark the occasion. He thanked former Servant Branch principal branch coordinator Louis Grams along with the rest of the coordinators and members of the branch for their efforts in helping to get the school going. Kerry also gave a talk to the graduates that brought together literature physics philosophy and Scripture not to mention photons gamma rays and gluons the origins of the universe human evolution and the development of writing. ""The development of writing had a greater impact on the evolution of human society than any other invention"" Kerry said. Writing allowed humans to create governments currency contracts and corporations and crucially it allowed the word of God to be written down. On the pages of Scripture humans can come to see and understand ""the fundamental narrative of all reality."" Trinity has offered its graduates a glimpse of that reality revealed in Scripture and in the natural world Kerry said.  Greenlawn graduates (back row:) Thom Behrens Katherine Couch (front:) Madeline Adams Hannah Ashley Erica Chabot Patrick Couch Arnie del Pilar John Feeks At Greenlawn's commencement graduate award winner Katherine Couch said in her valedictory that seeing a play Arthur Miller's All My Sons had convinced her of the importance of living a good life. ""All My Sons instilled in me a fierce desire to be better and to better the world through my choices"" she said. Katherine plans to study international relations and become a diplomat or a translator. She noted ""A good life doesn't have to be something flashy. It could be raising a family with love. It could be teaching high school. It could be painting or dancing or singing."" Dr. Peter Kilpatrick Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Notre Dame urged Greenlawn graduates to overcome their fears by maintaining a personal prayer time. ""Your conversation your dialogue with God on a daily basis is the most important thing you will do in your life"" he said. Of Trinity's 104 graduates 89 plan to attend college this fall.  The colleges they will attend include Johns Hopkins the University of Notre Dame the University of Chicago the University of Virginia and the U.S Military Academy at West Point. Several of the graduates opted to defer college in favor of military service charitable service or missionary work. Soon these Trinity grads will be serving in Belgium England Costa Rica Grenada Nicaragua and the Philippines. *** Graduate award winners Greenlawn: Katherine Couch Katherine Loughran Matthew Staffelbach Meadow View: Julia DeCelles-Zwerneman Karl Johnson River Ridge: Joshua Koletar Meg Thompson.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2559
2506,June 6 2012 9:11 p.m.,Summer Action Work Begins in Indianapolis,"by Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly  Louise Fossen (Servant Branch) Ben Blessard (northern Virgnia) and Haidy Busekrus (Oahu) working on the South Side of Indianapolis. Photo credit: Patricia Brewer Yesterday in Indianapolis a team of 14 volunteers began working at two homes on the South Side busting up concrete and hauling out trash and debris that had accumulated over decades. The team is the first of six Action teams that will work in Indianapolis and Allendale this summer repairing homes meeting neighbors and running camps for local children. The first Indianapolis team will gut the inside of 1646 Union Street a duplex removing plaster and lath from the walls tearing out old wiring and replacing a wood floor in preparation for a total renovation of the house. The house was overrun by cats until a Christians in Mission team member bought it in July 2011. Paul Hommes (CIM Indianapolis) who is supervising the renovation says later teams will scrape and paint the exterior of the house take down the chimney and prep the inside for further construction. Ben Blessard a high school freshman from northern Virginia decided to join the Action team late last week. “I’m looking forward to the demolition work” he says. Other team members include carpenter Chris Taylor and his wife Colette (Corvallis) Jack and Haidy Busekrus (Oahu) and Mary Dohrman (Oahu) and eight students from northern Virginia Servant Branch Shreveport and South Bend.  On the South Side of Indianapolis Action volunteers are working on 1646 and 1650 Union Street. CIM team members live close by in houses on both Karcher and Union streets. On Thursday team members will take a break from the dirty work to knock on doors and tell neighbors about the first People of Praise day camp for South Side children. The camp will begin on June 20 and run for about two weeks. “Our summer camp has been such a success in Allendale that we want to try it here. We already have some solid friendships with South Side children” says Michael Coney head of CIM in Indianapolis. “It’s a challenge not knowing who will be coming or how many or what their needs might be” adds Jo Zimmel (Servant Branch) a veteran of past Allendale camps and Servant Camp. She will be leading the new Indianapolis camp with help from her husband John. “But we think it’s God’s will to have this camp and I’m confident that it’s going to be great.” Jo is ready with activities that will work for a variety of age groups and numbers of children. In Allendale Action work will begin on June 18. The summer camp in its tenth year will run for six weeks and Ben Reinhardt who is leading the Action work there says he is planning for 50 children to attend on most days. (Attendance topped out at 57 last year.) Planned activities for boys include football basketball building birdhouses and racing pinewood derby cars. Planned girls’ activities include jumprope praise dancing cooking Bible skits and making stained glass crosses.  In Allendale Action volunteers will be renovating 1954 Dove St. CIM team members live in a string of contiguous houses located on Yale Avenue. Several home-repair projects for neighbors are also on the docket for Allendale Action teams: painting a shed removing and replacing an awning installing new windows and repairing walls. Team members will also tackle kitchen and bathroom repairs refinishing floors and painting at a house on Dove Street acquired by the People of Praise in March 2012. “We are beginning this 11th summer of work with a big head of steam thanks to the Action Conference we held in April” says Action program coordinator Mike Zusi (South Bend). ""We are grateful to be participating in our Father’s campaign to save the Mississippi River Valley. Pray especially that God will bless our neighbors and all the children who will be coming to our camps.” So far 102 volunteers have signed up for summer Action trips. Action administrator Catherine Bulger says slots are still open on some Action teams especially for adults.

2496,May 30 2012 8:31 p.m.,Annie Bulger Gives Saint Mary's College Valedictory,"By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly Annie Bulger (South Bend) delivered one of two valedictories at Saint Mary’s College (Notre Dame Indiana) on Saturday May 19. Annie was named co-valedictorian of the Saint Mary's College class of 2012 in March.  Annie with her parents Jim and Beth Bulger. Annie majored in math and maintained a perfect 4.0 grade point average during her time at Saint Mary's. After finishing classes in December she began working as a web site developer for one:ten communications a community business which is part of the LaSalle Company. She lives in the Elkhart Indiana house of the Sisterhood. Annie grew up in Servant Branch and attended Trinity School at River Ridge. ""I am humbled by this honor knowing that all I have comes from the Lord and all praise is due to him"" she says. In 2006 Annie began a two-year break from her studies to serve with the community's Missionary Company. In her valedictory she drew on this experience recounting a story about a man named Arnold who lived in a run-down neighborhood in Evansville: ""We sat in rusty yellow folding chairs that cluttered the porch of his ramshackle house and Arnold began to tell how he experiences the world. 'I thank the Lord for waking me up every morning' he said. 'I get to open my eyes and see his world. Then I get to feel his blood warming up my body. I get to splash some of his water on my face and sit down to eat some of his food.’ After a slow breath he continued with a smile ‘I'm the richest man in Evansville. I'm dirt poor but everything I see is mine because it belongs to my Father.’"" Annie went on to explain that her conversation with Arnold produced lasting fruit in her life and she urged her fellow graduates to produce lasting fruit through the major decisions they will be making. (The full text of Annie’s valedictory is available here.) Annie credits her parents Jim and Beth Bulger (Servant Branch) and her former Trinity School teachers with giving her a solid educational foundation. ""The Trinity senior math course played a big role in my decision to major in mathematics"" she says. ""John Vogel (Servant Branch) had a way of tantalizing us with powerful concepts like fractals and Cantor's theory teaching us just enough that we were in awe of their beauty but not so much that our curiosity was diminished."" Campus division coordinator Paul Kane (South Bend) says he has seen several former missionaries make smooth transitions back to college following missionary work. ""They become more confident and mature during their time as missionaries—more sure of the educational path they want to follow. It's no surprise that they hit the ground running when they come back to their studies."" Annie says that all of her past experiences—in math and on the mission field—contribute to her work as a web site developer. The logic skills she learned as a math major are a good background for computer programming work and the communications skills she learned as a missionary are an asset in relating to customers. ""I'm grateful to the Lord for such a good job to start off with"" she says.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2496
2491,May 22 2012 3:21 p.m.,Three Elected to Board of Governors,"Three men were elected to the community's board of governors on May 17 in South Bend: Mike Coney (New Orleans) Bob McDonough (South Bend) and Pat Murphy (Servant Branch). Each will serve a six-year term that begins in August. They will join eight other men who already serve on the board: Charlie Fraga (Vancouver/Portland) Joel Kibler (Servant Branch) Kerry Koller (South Bend) Craig Lent (chairman South Bend) Phil Monaco (Corvallis) Jim Mysliwiec (northern Virginia) Kevin Ranaghan (South Bend) and Mike Zusi (South Bend). In August Rich Preuss (South Bend) will complete his second consecutive term of service on the board. Members who serve two terms consecutively are not immediately eligible for reelection but can be reelected after a two-year break. Mike Coney is currently a member of the board and will begin his second term in August. Pat Murphy has been the Action division coordinator since its beginnings in Servant Branch in 2002. He is the academic dean of Trinity School at River Ridge where he also teaches biology and chemistry and coaches wrestling. Pat and his wife Lee Ann moved to the Twin Cities from Florida in 1978 to join Servants of the Lord community. They joined the People of Praise in 1982 and were among the first group of Servant Branch members to make the covenant of the People of Praise in 1985. The Murphys have five children. Bob McDonough pursued a career in banking for 32 years and became a vice-president of First National Bank in Elkhart Indiana. From 1987 to 2009 he was president of the People of Praise’s LaSalle Company in South Bend and continues to serve as an advisor to the company. Bob and his wife Maureen are the parents of five children. The McDonoughs joined the community in 1977. ""I am looking forward to the challenge of serving the community in this new way"" he says. Board members are elected by an assembly comprised of ""the overall coordinator head coordinators principal branch coordinators and program coordinators each having one vote. Previous overall coordinators and head coordinators who have served as such within six years and who are in good standing may attend and vote but they are not counted as part of the quorum"" (Principles of Structure and Government of the People of Praise).",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2491
2469,April 25 2012 8:26 a.m.,In Allendale A Busy Season Begins,"by Chris Meehan  Patti Deakin with one of her neighbors. In Allendale members of the Christians in Mission team are taking on new jobs new responsibilities and preparing for new members. ""Every member of the team is doing more than ever. It's a busy time"" says David Zimmel the mission coordinator responsible for Allendale. Nathan Barrett who leads the Christians in Mission team recently accepted a full-time job working with MBI a Shreveport-based manufacturer of blast-resistant buildings. Nathan and Genevieve are expecting their third child in May. Genevieve a part-time physical therapist recently volunteered to cook dinner each week for the single women's household so that they are free to run an after-school group for neighborhood children. Ben Reinhardt a 2011 graduate of the University of Minnesota has taken over responsibility for day-to-day administration of the Allendale work. He coordinates the work of visiting Action teams. He also makes himself available to respond to calls and visits from neighbors: a young man who needs a ride to a job interview or a neighbor who needs a ride to the hospital. Kathleen Mehaffey recently became the leader of the single women's household. The change freed up some time for former leader Joan Pingel a special education teacher so she can study more effective ways to work with the children of the neighborhood. Joan and Kathleen also make time for regular visits to a young single mother Susanna Howard who lives a few blocks away. ""We are reading through the Gospels together"" Kathleen says. ""She invited us to her baby shower and recently told us that we should start inviting more people to join us when we get together."" Laura Brummer a phone operator for a group medical practice runs one of three weekly after-school groups for neighborhood girls. She also enjoys driving neighborhood children to church each week. When the number of regulars grew to four she asked for help from Colleen Murray and Ben. Three of the children have asked to be baptized so Laura Colleen and Ben are teaching them about the 10 Commandments and other Christian basics so that they can be baptized in their respective church congregations. Gerry Deakin a sales rep for LaSalle Company in South Bend also acts as neighborhood bike repairman and landscaper for the CIM team. Lately he has also helped with administrative tasks related to the community's purchase of some nearby properties. His wife Patti meanwhile talks with neighborhood women who drop by and runs a weekly exercise group for some of the women. Ruthanne Seitz (Shreveport) continues leading a weekly Bible study for a group of older neighborhood women. Ron Seitz her husband a retired Lutheran pastor walks over to the women's houses and escorts them to the Bible study. Claudia Stephens one of the regulars recently ran into some family problems on her birthday. At one point in the day she thought O Lord if only I had some help with this situation. Just then there was a knock at the door. It was Ruthanne and Patti bringing a birthday dessert. The three of them were able to pray about the situation together a great comfort to Claudia. Thomas Duddy has finished his first year as a nurse at Shreveport’s VA hospital. He keeps up a friendship with Ed Allison a retired neighbor who has come to prayer meetings and has helped with Action projects in the summer.  1442 Yale Avenue will become home for Pat and Edna Malone (South Bend) beginning in June. What’s next for the CIM team?  A volunteer crew comprised of about 30 women from campus and mission divisions will arrive for a work trip in early May. In late May Edna Malone will move in ahead of her husband Pat who is coming in mid-June after wrapping up his 25-year teaching career at Trinity School at Greenlawn. The Malones are excited to be joining the CIM team in Allendale. John Bowar (Servant Branch) will also be joining the team this summer following his graduation from the University of Minnesota. Action teams will begin arriving in June and will get right to work repairing neighbors' homes and organizing the summer camp. After record attendance at last year's camp (57 campers at its peak) this year's camp will be divided into seven different groups along age and gender lines. At the end of the summer long-time team member Josh Caneff a remote employee of the Healy Group in South Bend and Mary Claire Busk (Indianapolis) will be getting married. (The wedding will take place in South Bend.) Mary Claire recently moved from Indianapolis to Allendale and is living in household with the Barretts. ""The Lord is doing so much with us that it is sometimes hard to keep track of it all"" David says. ""We are especially grateful that he is giving us new CIM team members so that we can continue to grow and expand his work in Allendale.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2469
2473,April 25 2012 8:20 a.m.,Vancouver-Portland Takes New Steps on Ecumenical and Outreach Fronts,"by Chris Meehan Vancouver-Portland branch members are playing a big role in helping to organize a day-long free health clinic for their north Portland neighbors. It is an ecumenical collaboration bringing together community members and members of a wide range of north Portland churches. Baptists Pentecostals Methodists Presbyterians and Roman Catholics are among those represented. On August 4 north Portland residents can come to Roosevelt High School to receive free medical dental and eye exams chiropractic care and other services. Event planners are following a template created by Compassion Connect a Christian nonprofit organization that has been a resource for similar clinics around Portland for more than five years. ""This is a unique opportunity for us to connect with and love our neighbors in north Portland as Christ in a very practical way"" says principal branch coordinator Charlie Fraga. Seven or eight hundred neighbors and volunteers are expected to participate. Branch members are hard at work as leaders of seven of the 15 task forces that are planning and implementing the clinic. Ann Martinez is recruiting translators who speak Spanish Russian and a host of other languages. Jerome Devlaeminck and Charlie are serving on the finance team. Steve Hansen and Erin Davis are leading a team that will transport and set up medical and dental equipment. Luke Glover and Andrew Ridenour are responsible for security. Liz Cole is lining up childcare and Linda Jo Devlaeminck is organizing a social services fair that will take place during the clinic. Many other branch members are working on these and other task forces. Fred Dang is organizing transportation for patients to satellite sites--offices of dentists who want to participate but can't set up shop at the high school. ""I hope to accomplish this with much prayer fasting and being open to the Holy Spirit"" he says noting that the time guests spend riding between sites will be a prime time for establishing Christian relationships with them. The branch has been doing city-building work in north Portland since 2006. The area is now home to 35 adult branch members. Trinity Academy a school the branch started last fall and Direct Development a business that Charlie leads and which employs several community members are also located in north Portland. The genesis of the health clinic project dates to the fall of 2010 when branch members living in north Portland were seeking new ways that they could connect with their neighbors in Christ. In that process Eric Shreves heard about Compassion Connect's efforts in other Portland neighborhoods. He discussed the idea of organizing a north Portland clinic with Charlie and the other branch coordinators. They presented it to the branch for consideration at a January 2011 community meeting. After researching the idea some more the branch decided to pursue being a catalyst for launching a north Portland neighborhood clinic. Fred Dang and several others worked to find pastors to cosponsor the clinic but they had little success at first. A breakthrough came late in the summer of 2011 when branch members were looking around for space for Trinity Academy and came across Northminster Presbyterian Church. “Not only was the pastor open to having our school at his facility” says Charlie “but he liked the idea of the clinic. He introduced us to a group of 30 or so ministers he met with regularly who had real interest in working to bring tangible benefits of the kingdom of God to the area. Several of them had heard about Compassion Connect but none had been able to devote as much time to investigate it as we had.” Charlie Fred and six of the pastors and other Christian leaders agreed to form an executive committee to launch and oversee the clinic. They recently sponsored an official kick-off gathering to attract the 300 to 400 volunteers it will take to care for the expected crowd of 400 on the big day. Nearly all of the 175 attendees signed up as volunteers. The executive director of the Compassion Connect resource center in Portland said that this was by far the most highly attended kickoff event he had ever seen. ""Being a big player in the organization of a clinic like this is new territory for our branch"" says Charlie. ""We expect some glitches and time crunches along the way but we are excited to reach out to our neighbors in love and to have the chance to build relationships with them. We ask the whole community to join us in prayer for this effort.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2473
2443,March 30 2012 2:48 p.m.,Healing Update: An Adult Tooth for Veronica Linczer,By Chris Meehan  Veronica Linczer Two years ago we reported the story of Veronica Linczer daughter of Ron and Anne Linczer (South Bend) who was born with a cleft palate. When Veronica was three doctors recommended a surgery to graft bone from her hip into her jaw so that a permanent tooth would be able to grow at the site of the cleft. After many prayers however the cleft closed on its own and a baby tooth emerged surprising specialists at an Indianapolis children’s hospital and making the surgery unnecessary. Veronica is now seven and last February Anne took her to see an orthodontist her first visit to see him in three years since before the healing. Anne was excited about the appointment anticipating that new X-rays would be compared to older X-rays giving her an opportunity to talk about the healing. Anne says she was “giddy with anticipation.” She began by telling the doctor all about Veronica’s healing. She says the orthodontist responded reservedly suspending judgment until after an exam and fresh X-rays. First he examined Veronica’s mouth. He said that he could see a space where a baby tooth had fallen out and he wondered if an adult tooth would be coming in. Then he took X-rays. When he brought the new X-rays in the doctor was excited. “He kept saying that it was a miracle” Anne recalls. “He said that there was a 100% certainty that no tooth would come through a cleft but he could see an adult tooth coming in where the baby tooth had been.” The adult tooth had turned sideways meaning some orthodontic work will be needed in the future. “It was great to share about a miracle like that in a doctor’s office and to see documentation with X-rays” Anne says. “I want to give God the glory!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2443

Her victory secured her a spot in the highly competitive Scripps National Spelling Bee to be held in Washington DC in late May. Jessica will have to pass a written spelling test and two oral exams to qualify for the final event the famous spelling bee televised nationally on ESPN. “I really didn't think I could win” Jessica said “especially when I heard that last year's winner was allowed to try again.” In addition to overcoming the defending champ Jessica beat out competitors from 40 schools in a large region comprised of seven parishes and including the city of New Orleans. One competitor was her own 11-year-old brother Peter a sixth-grader who also made it to the top five before getting knocked out in round 12 after misspelling the word “homburg” (a stiff German-style felt hat). Those final four spellers hung on doggedly for 22 more rounds so long that the judges ran out of words on the list of 500 they had given the participants as a study guide. At some point Jessica realized she was in uncharted waters needing to spell words she had not practiced. In round 34 all four correctly navigated through words like “hoomalimali” (a Hawaiian word for something whose purpose is to attract positive attention) “sarsaparilla” “perestroika” “apparatchik” and “beetewk” (a Russian breed of work horses).  Finally the other three stumbled on “cinephile” “phosphorus” and  “symmetrical” respectively. To secure the win Jessica spelled two words in a row correctly: “morose” and then “forage.” A seventh-grader at St. Benilde School in Metairie Jessica follows in the footsteps of her older sister Melinda who won the same contest two years ago and went to DC. She and Shyla had brought Jessica along for the week of activities including tours of the national monuments. “I think that experience made a big impression on her” says Shyla. “This past fall my mother told me to give spelling bees a try” Jessica says. “I did and discovered how fun it is.” Jessica attributes some of her success to her love of reading. “It’s easier to remember a word if you’ve read it.” She reads all sorts of books; The Lord of the Rings is her favorite series. Another factor in the win: “I studied the guide list and my brother and I quizzed each other.” Basil will be the only family member available to accompany Jessica to Washington for the national bee. “We didn’t put much thought into the possibility she might win so we went ahead and purchased tickets to go back home to India for a family gathering” Basil said. “Shyla will go to India as planned with Melinda and Peter. Jessica and I will join them later.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2439
2400,March 22 2012 12:30 p.m.,Trinity Girls Win State Basketball Tournament,By Chris Meehan  From left: Laura Nagle Coach Heather Hahn Marilyn Preuss Olivia Griggs Rachel Cramer Sierra Barbour Journee Elie; Christen Havard Molly Hoover Katie Was Marian DeLee The girls’ varsity basketball team from Trinity School at Greenlawn edged out Lighthouse Christian Academy of Bloomington Indiana to win the state tournament of the Indiana Association of Christian Schools (IACS) on March 3. “The outcome was in question the entire game but our girls prevailed and won by one point: 37-36” said first-year coach Heather Hahn. “I’m tremendously proud of how theyplayed.” “We felt a lot of momentum remaining from last year when we came in second in the same tournament with basically the same players” says junior co-captain Christen Havard who plays post. “We had heard that Lighthouse Christian was pretty good” adds junior guard and co-captain Marian Delee “but we were still confident.”  Katie Was and Marilyn Preuss. Trinity started out slow with Lighthouse making the first few baskets. “Eventually Molly Hoover made a three-point shot that rallied us” says Marilyn Preuss a sophomore playing post. At the end of the first quarter the score was 11-14 Lighthouse. The lead seesawed from team to team in the second quarter. “I was frustrated” says Christen. “I wasn’t getting rebounds and shots. But I was more concerned with how the team was doing. We started accumulating fouls.” At the half Trinity was still down 18-22. Christen remembers half-time: “We looked at one another and said to ourselves ‘We’re not losing! We’re going to win. We’ve been looking forward to this since last year.” “Second half we had a more solid defense and started thinking about our shots” says Marian. “We scored less but we got our heads together. The fans were cheering more which gave us energy.” At the end of the third quarter Trinity was behind by the largest margin of the night 26-32 but the tide quickly turned. Molly Hoover made another three-point basket and Trinity managed not only to catch up but to fashion a six-point lead from which Lighthouse never fully recovered.  Molly Hoover Katie Was and Christen Havard in the championship game. Except they almost did. During the last few minutes “Lighthouse slowly caught up to us with free throws” says Marian. “We knew they wanted to foul us to get the ball back and win through free throws. But we passed back and forth so well they weren’t fast enough to foul us. It was like a giant game of Keepaway until the clock wound down.” “Coach had taught us how to close up games” says junior guard Katie Was. The girls ended the season with a 19-5 record. “The best thing about coaching at Trinity is that there’s no attitude problem” says Coach Hahn. “The girls care about one another and help one another. Plus there are no seniors on the team this year so I expect an experienced crew and bright future next season!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2400
2378,March 22 2012 12:11 p.m.,CIM Members Survive Dangerous Car Accident,by Chris Meehan  The totaled car. On a stormy afternoon in early March a pickup truck traveling at highway speeds slammed into the back of a Ford Explorer carrying Justin and Cathy Walters (CIM Indianapolis). The pickup shoved the Explorer forward lodging it beneath the back of a semi. The Explorer’s windshield shattered; its hood crumpled like paper. But Justin and Cathy their car smashed between two vehicles escaped unharmed except for minor whiplash. (Watch video.) Justin and Cathy were driving to North Carolina to visit Justin’s two sisters and their families on Friday March 2. They passed through storms in Kentucky that reduced visibility and caused slick spots on the road. An accident ahead of them halted traffic on I-75 creating a long line of stopped vehicles. A semi sat at the end of the line and Justin stopped behind it. A couple seconds later they heard a loud bang and felt a massive jolt as the pick up truck slammed into their Explorer. A semi’s huge back bumper loomed just a few feet in front of their faces. “The suddenness was disorienting” says Justin. “The rear-end and front-end crashes felt like one big collision.”The Explorer came to a halt. Its airbags deployed. “Are you OK?” Justin asked Cathy. “I think so” she ventured. “‘Thank you Lord! Thank you Lord! Thaaaank you Lord!’ was all I could say” says Justin. “We prayed briefly then got out. Cathy had to crawl out my side.” People got out of their cars and offered help encouragement and prayer. Several witnesses described the events to the police. The driver of the pickup apologized for failing to stop in time and Justin and Cathy offered their forgiveness. An ambulance brought Justin and Cathy to a hospital for X-Rays and CAT scans but the tests showed no serious injuries. After several hours–spent mostly contacting family and friends–they were released. The Walterses’ insurance company declared the Explorer totaled offering them a generous settlement that has helped them buy a new car. “God’s angels must have been busy looking after us” says Cathy. “We are so aware of how much worse things could have been” adds Justin. “From what we could tell the other two drivers also experienced little more than whiplash.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2378

2309,Feb. 4 2012 11:44 a.m.,South Bend Campers Heading North to Servant Camp,By Chris Meehan Campers and counselors from the South Bend branch will head north to Canon Falls Minnesota in August to join Servant Branch brothers and sisters for a week at Servant Camp. John Zwerneman made the announcement at a meeting of the South Bend branch on January 8 following a series of discussions in the branch about the future of its summer camp. “This year we're going to be joining forces with another very successful camp that began the same year our camp did in 1978” John said. Servant Camp director Pat Ficker is enthusiastic about a unified camp. “I am extremely happy at the prospect of combining camps” he says “and my fellow camp directors are delighted as well. I think it’s the Lord at work–making us all one.” John explained that the South Bend branch will not hold their camp locally in the next few years due to rising costs scheduling conflicts and a forecasted decline in the number of branch youth. “We decided to take action now before a decline in numbers became a big problem” he said. Servant Camp has also seen a decline in the number of campers in recent years making the move advantageous for both branches Pat says. John and Mary Behrens (South Bend) directors of the South Bend branch's camp will join Pat’s administrative staff and take special concern for the campers from South Bend. Pat says he hopes to place a counselor or two from South Bend with each group of campers. “We’re looking forward to the relationships that will blossom for our children when they experience the joys of summer camp with the children from Servant Branch” John Behrens says. South Bend parent Ann Marie Pingel admits to feeling a touch of sadness that South Bend branch members won’t be returning to Michigan’s Camp Tanadoonah in 2012 but she also sees a sunny side: “I'm excited about the opportunities our children will have to build relationships between branches–something that usually has to wait until they join Action.” South Bend camper Leo Kane (10) is excited that the new camp will give him the opportunity to fire a gun at their rifle range. His friend Xavier Olsen 11 agreed but added that using the camp’s climbing wall is a primary goal for him. Calla Couch (20) is a veteran of both camps and has been encouraging her South Bend friends to join her at Servant Camp for years. “I really like it that the camp property is so large offering plenty of beautiful hiking space.” This year’s camp will be a family affair for Calla: not only are her two sisters Katherine (17) and Colleen (15) serving as counselors and her youngest siblings Daniel (13) Aidan (10) and Bonnie (7) going as campers but her mother Beth has also volunteered to be a counselor. Long-time camp director Larry Grauvogel (South Bend) says the move fits in well with the history of camp in South Bend. “We’ve always been kind of flexible switching locations from time to time. Though the commute time will obviously take longer this way there’s a plus: Servant Camp is open to 8th-10th graders for whom South Bend camp hasn’t been.” Servant Camp has has been the week-long home for thousands of campers since its start in 1978. Carmen Lee (Servant Branch) led the camp for 26 of those years until his retirement in 2010. “Every year we hear stories of how God blessed camp with healings surprises interventions in the weather and great relationships” says John Zwerneman. “We know that camp is a wonderful part of our life and we are thrilled to be doing it in this new way. “This will be an exciting new adventure for us in South Bend. Please pray for both branches as we prepare to join together for camp in 2012.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2309
2300,Feb. 4 2012 11:39 a.m.,In South Bend Back Pain Disappears,"By Chris Meehan  Pete and Megan Sgroi Early in the afternoon on December 4 Megan Sgroi (South Bend) was pushing her grocery cart up and down the aisles when she felt the pain level in her back rising. She didn't think she had the strength to finish her shopping so she left her cart in front of the service desk and hurried home for a rest. She thought about skipping the community meeting at 3:00 but decided she would go and brave her way through it. She spent most of the meeting lying down at the back of the room. When the meeting ended Jodi Engles and Claire Kurdelak chatted with Megan and then prayed with her. Megan also asked for healing prayers from Mark Timler who was serving on the prayer team. Megan says she didn’t experience any drop in her pain level during the prayer “but within two or three days I noticed all the pain was gone."" Now almost two months later Megan’s back is still feeling fine. A part-time nurse and mother of five she no longer has trouble loading the dishwasher shopping for groceries sitting at a desk at work or sleeping through the night. “I’m able to do everything I need to do at work and at home” she says. Her struggle with back pain began in August 2010 and seemed to be triggered by a strenuous exercise routine. “Megan was in pain all the time” her husband Pete remembers. ""She had to lie down several times a day.” “Pete and the kids would help when they could” Megan says “but with him working and five children ages 2 to 11 our hands are pretty full. Life still goes on . . . so I did too.” An MRI revealed a bulging disc in her lower spine which was pressing on a nerve. After a few months of physical therapy last winter Megan began receiving spinal injections from an anesthesiologist. One of the injections worked but six months later the pain returned as bad as it had ever been. She experienced the pain for about three weeks before it disappeared again three days after the December 4 community meeting where she received prayer. A few weeks after the pain left at Christmastime Pete and Megan hosted two dinners for 23 members of Pete's family. “Megan went well above and beyond the call of duty for us” says Pete’s mother Gerry Sgroi (South Bend). “She was carrying on like a house afire for days. ""She couldn’t have done that before.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2300
2278,Feb. 2 2012 11:07 a.m.,Abbie Teeter (South Bend),By Barbara Sahut  Abbie Teeter I first met my very good friend Abbie Teeter in San Francisco in the early 1970s when she drove several of us to a weekend retreat of John the Baptist Charismatic Renewal Community. We shared many memorable experiences in those days. The JBCRC Saturday evening prayer meetings were so crowded that some of the people would usually be sitting on the floor and after the meeting we’d go to someone’s home for Mass and then stay up talking till the early morning hours. In 1977 we both moved to South Bend to join the People of Praise. With over 100 others we headed cross-country leaving the people and places that we loved discovering God’s new plan for us. Abbie made the covenant September 24 1977 and in 1981 I purchased a home later known as Shalom House and invited Abbie and Luiza Freitas to move in with me. We really enjoyed living together in our household. Abbie was an inspiration because she had her personal prayer time around 5 a.m. before our 6 a.m. household prayer. She was always very practical and down to earth. She did my mending and I balanced her checking account a win/win situation. I can only remember being upset with her once. She mentioned at a household meeting that our outside plants needed “dusting.” I thought that was taking cleanliness too far! Who cared if the plants outside were dusty? Then Abbie patiently explained to Luiza and me (city girls) that you put dust on plants to keep bugs away. Abbie frequently spoke about her family so in the early 1980s the two of us took Abbie’s car with plenty of tapes on the Bible and visited her family in California. That was a great trip and we took several other vacations together. One Christmas we visited her son Jim and his family in California. One year we went to Branson Missouri. One year we went to Phoenix to visit friends and then to Snowflake AZ where Abbie’s son Bill lived. She also traveled to Germany Spain the Holy Land Rome and Guam. Abbie was born June 19 1917 on a homestead in Terry Montana and the Welliver family moved to Bismarck North Dakota when she was a child. She started work as a telephone operator after high school. Abbie and her husband Francis Teeter were married October 5 1936. During World War II Francis served in the Army so Abbie moved to the San Francisco Bay area where her parents had relocated. Abbie and Francis raised six children in the Bay area before divorcing in 1971. She is survived by five children 14 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. When Abbie moved to South Bend in 1977 she arrived with no prospect of a job but her long experience working for Pacific Bell led to a position with Indiana Bell and she worked there until her retirement. She was a union steward and held several management positions. The people she trained discovered that she wouldn’t settle for anything less than excellence and they responded accordingly. Abbie started the branch’s intercessory prayer vigil for widows and older single women. This was a monthly overnight vigil at the LaSalle Building to pray for the needs of the community and other needs we knew about. She always volunteered Shalom House to cook so everybody would have a great main meal. At a memorial luncheon at the branch center in South Bend on April 2 several of Abbie’s friends paid glowing tribute to her. Gwen DeLee remembered “For 11 months I accompanied Abbie on her visits for the St. Vincent De Paul Society. She was a great mentor. We visited the homes of the very very poor and I couldn’t get over how well she related to them. She amazed me. She was very direct very realistic and intent on helping them out in very practical ways. She had an immediate rapport with them. At that time Action division was developing programs to help people in society at large beyond the People of Praise. Through Abbie I saw that it was possible. We really could relate genuinely to people in dire need.” In 1985 when Action division started Home Management Services (now Home Management Resources) to teach women the practical skills of running a home Abbie was in the first group of counselors. In her HMS classes she taught sewing cooking and crafts and she was an excellent counselor one-on-one. “Intercessory prayer was a passion for Abbie” said Jackie Curran at the memorial service in the branch center. “She was a magnet for prayer intentions. She collected them from divisions areas and all the branches and kept them in a large box in alphabetical order. Sometimes our prayer vigil would take place on a football Saturday. Of course everybody knew Abbie absolutely loved Notre Dame football but the prayer vigil was more important. So the game would be showing on the TV right up until the minute we began the vigil then Abbie would click it off and we’d start singing “Spirit of the Living God.” When she shared this Jackie was wearing a jacket that Abbie had made for her. “When my son John said his first Mass in South Bend after ordination Abbie made the chasuble he wore. For years her scarves table covers and Christmas decorations were the hottest items in the branch’s Christmas bazaar benefiting Trinity School. “I was Abbie’s head when she was housebound because of health problems so I asked her how I could serve her. She didn’t want things for herself. She wanted me to visit Ethel Chalk at Providence House because Abbie herself couldn’t go. And she was very concerned that no one in Jo Geissler’s women’s group was able to visit her so she asked me to go instead. (No matter that we were having a severe snowstorm!) I felt privileged to be an extension of this marvelous woman in Christ.” Marylen Robinson recalled that Abbie taught the Girl Scouts in the branch to decorate Christmas cookies as well as making their uniform vests for them. Terry Paukert said “When I got married I didn’t have a lot of money so Abbie made my wedding dress.” Abbie’s generosity to the Trinity School scholarship fund enabled many students to attend who couldn’t have done so otherwise. In June 2006 she reluctantly left branch life in South Bend and moved back to California to live with her son Jim and his wife Mary Ellen who cared for her lovingly until she died January 11 2011 at the age of 93. Jim described his mother in a typical scene sitting by the fireplace with grandkids everywhere playing with their Star Wars toys. “Mom was grinning constantly the whole time the grandkids played there around her.” Betsy Cotter reminded us all of one of the key characteristics of this woman of God: “Abbie gave. She always looked around for needs she could fill. Despite the difficulties she faced in her life that familiar smile always returned quickly to her face. Today when we walk into the branch center in South Bend facing us on the opposite wall from the front door is a large picture of Jesus with a big smile on his face. That picture also is a gift from Abbie.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2278
2274,Feb. 2 2012 10:59 a.m.,Beryl Plodowski (South Bend),By Tom Noe Editor’s Note: Andrew and Beryl Plodowski’s amazing story is told in Tom Noe’s book Into the Lion’s Den available here.  Beryl Plodowski Beryl Plodowski (South Bend) an energetic and outgoing wife mother and covenanted sister has gone ahead of us to meet God face to face. She had lived in Florida since 1985 but the details of her life spanned nations and continents. Beryl Dowd was born September 8 1922 in Liverpool England. She grew up in a devout Anglican family graduated from Holly Lodge High School and then enrolled in a commercial school while working for the Royal Insurance Company. During the wartime blitz the staff was evacuated across the river to Oxton Wirral where they sometimes spent all day in air-raid shelters. Early in 1942 she met a young Polish serviceman Andrew Plodowski. In 1939 Andrew had narrowly escaped death at the infamous Soviet massacre of 21000 Polish soldiers at Katyn. He had gradually made his way underground to England where he joined one of the Polish squadrons of the RAF. They were married on April 28 1943 and after a short honeymoon Andrew returned to his RAF station in Lincolnshire. He flew the maximum number of missions allowed achieved the rank of major and was transferred to Polish Air Force headquarters in London where he edited its bilingual publication Skrzydla (Wings). It was a painful separation. London was under constant bombardment by the Nazis so Andrew didn’t want to expose Beryl—and the child they were then expecting—to any danger. They rented two rooms in Wallasey near Beryl’s parents and Andrew commuted from London whenever he could. When Beryl was expecting their second child she insisted that the family find some way to live together so Andrew located a place in London. Friends were helping them clean it up when a German flying bomb exploded 100 feet away. Miraculously no one was hurt but the house was in shambles. Then Andrew located a three-room apartment which Beryl transformed into a livable home despite such added wartime features as a crack in the wall through which they could watch the stars at night! After the war Andrew and Beryl and their two young daughters Krys and Barb lived in London for three years. Few Polish veterans were returning to Poland which was under Soviet control and they decided that starting over in the United States was their best option. Andrew graduated from Notre Dame Law School in 1952 their son Andrew John was born in 1953 and after they became U.S. citizens in 1954 Andrew started his law practice out of their home in Mishawaka Indiana. Over the years Andrew devoted himself to a wide range of parish and renewal activities from leadership in the Cursillo and deacon-training to charismatic renewal and even seeking a seat as a prolife candidate for county judge. He traveled to Rome during each session of the Second Vatican Council in order to meet all the Polish bishops personally and to arrange for sending them books and Bibles. He was a founding member of the People of Praise. When Beryl made the covenant November 1 1974 she didn’t know that her life would soon begin to blossom in an unexpected direction. Two Polish priests visited their household in South Bend in 1976 and invited them to come to Poland to do God’s work. The next summer the community sent Andrew and Beryl behind the Iron Curtain for three months where God used them to spearhead the growth and development of the charismatic renewal throughout Poland. This traveling ministry lasted until 1989 and Beryl accompanied Andrew on his annual trips whenever feasible. Gradually as she became more comfortable with the Polish language she began sharing insights at retreats and conferences and giving talks through a translator. They prayed over many hundreds of people at retreats prayer meetings and planning sessions. But Beryl was concerned with more than speaking. “Life was so difficult for them” she recalled. “Here you stood with your sweater and your extra shoes and the people you were visiting didn’t even have a nice shirt to wear. We gave them our clothes we gave them our belts shoes everything. We packed our suitcases with their needs in mind buying sturdy well-made clothing to take along because we knew we’d be giving it all away when we got to Poland.” In Poland Andrew and Beryl shared People of Praise teachings and fostered Christian community while constantly under observation by Communist authorities in daily need of necessities like food and sleep and despite Andrew’s heart condition and several other ailments. (Both were in their 60s.) They always returned to the U.S. utterly exhausted. Andrew once wrote home to South Bend “If I hadn’t had my oil two cans of salmon some nuts and raisins we probably would have starved.” It was also mentally exhausting since they never knew when the Bibles and texts they were taking into Poland might be confiscated. One misstep and the Communist government could order them to leave the country immediately and ban them from future trips. One time at Magdalenka near Warsaw Beryl gave a talk on sisterhood based on People of Praise teachings. Andrew wrote home about the good reception her talk received. Later in Poznan spending time with the numerous prayer groups in that region Beryl gave several more talks. Andrew was delighted at the good reactions of the listeners especially the women. They moved to Venice Florida in 1985 for retirement and health reasons. Actually it wasn’t quite a retirement because both continued serving the Lord and the church in addition to making more trips to Poland. Andrew was a deacon at Epiphany Cathedral and they attended the parish charismatic prayer meeting. They were always delighted to welcome friends who were able to visit from Poland and some foreign visitors experienced freedom of religion and freedom of speech for the first time. Andrew’s death in 1995 hit Beryl very hard but she bravely continued to stay active. She followed a bit of wise advice: “Don’t say no” meaning respond to every invitation to get out and be with people. So Beryl expanded her volunteer work. She continued working at Epiphany Cathedral’s gift shop for many years and volunteered almost daily at the second-hand clothing center run by St. Mark’s Episcopal Church. She loved the interaction and enjoyed talking to the staff and clients. Her life also continued to revolve around family and she traveled north every summer to stay with her children’s families for several weeks at a time. She was thrilled to be right in the thick of all the grandkids’ activities. Beryl always loved telling stories. As Julie Walters (South Bend) recalls “She was a wonderful conversationalist always eager and alert and sometimes very funny in her understated way.” They were having tea one day when Julie bragged “Beryl I can get three cups of tea out of one tea bag.” Beryl replied in her wonderful British accent “Oh Julie it must not be very good tea.” Julie says “Beryl never told me how many cups she could get out of one bag but every time I have a cup of tea I think of her and that incident and I have to laugh.” Beryl was 88 when she fell at her Florida home in January 2011 and complications from that injury led to her death on April 20. In addition to her children Krystyna Barbara and Andrew John she also leaves behind six grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren and many thousands of renewed Christian brothers and sisters in Poland who can trace their experience of being baptized in the Spirit to the ministry of our brother and sister Andrew and Beryl Plodowski.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2274
2271,Feb. 2 2012 10:53 a.m.,Betty Cerrentano (Rockford),By Jennifer Ambrose  Len and Betty Cerrentano Elizabeth Cerrentano better known to her family and friends as Betty left us in the Rockford branch on October 16 2010 at the age of 59. Her death seemed to come far too early especially for those of us who had known and appreciated Betty's melodious laughter and had seen her unconditional love. If you were the happy recipient of Betty's kind of love you would have known the wonderful experience of sitting down with her and recounting one of life’s trials familiar to all and then you and Betty would have both had a good laugh that lightened your load every time. Betty was born in Chicago on September 3 1951. She and Len (Pudge) were married October 26 1974 and together raised six children Danny Lonellen Kris Ann Kimberley Jenny and Cindy. There are 16 grandchildren. She belonged to St. Peter Catholic Church in South Beloit where for many years she served as the coordinator for the Adoration Chapel. Pudge and Betty were among a group of about 100 people who attended a Life in the Spirit Seminar at the parish about 17 years ago. My husband Stu and I were asked to help pray with people to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and we found ourselves praying with Pudge and Betty. It seemed like everything was happening to them in a rush. After not being involved in church for many years they had just recently had their marriage blessed. Then within a very short time they were also baptized in the Holy Spirit then started going to prayer meetings and then to community meetings. Their lives really changed a lot and they just gulped it all down because they were really hungry for God after those years away from the church. They came underway in the People of Praise and made the covenant on March 30 1996. Pudge worked for many years in waste management and the two of them also opened and operated a spiral-sliced ham store for several years. Soon to follow was Betty's avid and meticulous collection of costume jewelry especially pieces in retro style. Betty went into all of her hobbies and business interests with an eye for the fine points. In fact she was always making lists so she could keep information organized and available. It seemed to be part of her character getting interested in things down to the most specific details. But nothing was ever so detailed as her research into how to live a provident and resourceful life as described in the People of Praise teachings. She did an enormous amount of research and gathered information on many topics related to that: how long food can be preserved how to store things in the basement how many canned goods are needed to feed people for a week or a month etc. Betty's research and her lists of high-quality information benefited all of us in the branch in preparing for any potential hard times ahead. It was difficult for us in Betty's women's group when she began to miss our gatherings in the late fall of 2009 because of what seemed to be an infection. When it was determined in April 2010 that she actually had bladder cancer it seemed as if she would be seeing the Lord face to face sooner than we had expected. There wasn't a person who visited Betty who didn't get swept up into her excitement to see what God had in store for her in the next stage of her life in him. Pudge said that the last two days before she died it was as if the Lord had arranged her visitors to arrive according to a very peaceful and orderly schedule. For those necessarily short visits people spontaneously arrived in twos about 10 minutes apart with such harmony that you would have thought Betty herself had orchestrated her goodbyes to us. I went to visit her at home just before she died and Betty was eager to take her next step toward the fullness of God’s love. She said “This mortal body can’t handle all the love that’s coming at me. I just want to forgive everybody and have everybody forgive me if I’ve hurt them.” Betty died knowing that she was truly loved by her family and friends many of whom surrounded her in her final days. She wanted to thank everyone for every letter prayer thought and meal. We'll all miss Betty and will forever remember the joy with which she looked forward to the embrace of the Lord.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2271
2266,Feb. 2 2012 10:49 a.m.,Dick Dudek (Buffalo),By Arlene Meyerhofer  Dick Dudek Dick Dudek’s weathered appearance and callused hands made him look gruff but the twinkle in his eye and the generosity of his spirit would quickly reveal the soft-heartedness of the man. He was a humble and quiet man who never sought power or attention but he was generous and meticulous in his service to God and to his brothers and sisters in the Buffalo branch of the People of Praise. Dick was born in Buffalo on April 20 1936 and lived in western New York his whole life except for his time in the Army. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was only nine months old. He himself remained in a TB isolation facility until he was two when a loving couple with no children of their own took him into their home. When Dick was 11 his natural father remarried and he brought Dick back to live with his new stepmother and her two older children. This was not a good situation for Dick but during this time he worked many hours in his father’s garage and developed a knack for fixing just about anything. When he was old enough Dick enlisted in the Army and served as a medic. After his first tour of duty he returned home but was soon thinking about reenlisting . . . that is until he went on a blind date with Mary Ann Tarnowski on November 8 1958. Immediately they were almost inseparable. Dick had no religious upbringing but he could see the significance of faith to Mary Ann and so he gave her a cross as a first Christmas gift. On her birthday February 1 1959 he gave her an engagement ring. That September Dick and Mary Ann were married. He adored her and appreciated everything she did. Mary Ann says that since the day they were married there was never a time when Dick didn’t thank her for whatever food she served and tell her how good it was. In 1962 their twin daughters Dawn and Donna were born. An interesting note is that even the doctor had no idea that Mary Ann was carrying twins. Dick was sure that the nurse who brought him the surprising news was joking and Mary Ann thought the chloroform they used for anesthesia must have affected her vision! But there really were two beautiful little girls. Dick always worked as a mechanic and he could fix anything. Just after the twins were born he was working for the New York State Thruway Authority and suffered multiple injuries when a tractor slipped into gear ran over him and mangled his foot. Miraculously no bones were broken. With the help of family and friends the Dudeks made it through the long recovery period on half pay. Dick retired from his position there in 1994 after a heart attack. He always attended Mass with the family but most of the time religion didn’t play a major role in Dick’s life. As a couple they attended a Marriage Encounter in 1975 but it was Mary Ann who became involved in the charismatic prayer meetings at the local church. Dick was always glad to let Mary Ann do whatever made her happy but he didn’t join her at the meetings. Donna would often go along with her mother but Dawn loved to be outside fishing hunting gardening or working with her Dad. Around 2000 Mary Ann began attending intercessory prayer meetings with the People of Praise branch in Buffalo. Her most fervent prayer was that someday her husband would be sitting there beside her. It was years before he finally attended a Buffalo branch picnic but once he came he never stopped attending branch events. He repeatedly commented on how evident the love of Christ was among the people in the community. Dick made the covenant of the People of Praise on May 31 2009. Quiet and unobtrusive he never sought to be the center of attention. But without fail if anyone ever expressed a need Dick was always there. One time I mentioned that I was looking for a good used car for my daughter. At the next branch meeting Dick said he had been driving around looking and noticed one or two that might be worth my consideration. Without fail whenever there was an engine problem with people’s cars lawn mowers etc. but especially with a boat engine Dick would always know exactly what the issue was and how to fix it. And he’d always remember to check back later and make sure everything was working. He quickly became the branch “go to” man for any mechanical problem no matter how big or small. He also loved to fish and hunt. After he retired he would take Mary Anne out in the boat all day then Dawn would meet them for dinner and she would fish with Dick through the night. At the branch celebration of Lessons and Carols in December Dick complained that he wasn’t feeling well. A few days later he went to the doctor who discovered a mass on his pancreas. Dick died January 6 2011. There are several important things that everyone will remember about Dick: He absolutely adored his wife Mary Ann; Family including his five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren was very important to him; He could fix anything; His love of the People of Praise and its members was sincere. All of us here in Buffalo will sorely miss the twinkle in his eye and the warmth of his embrace.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2266
2262,Feb. 2 2012 10:45 a.m.,Harold R. Roland (Servant Branch),By Jack Weiland  Harold Roland When we remember the long life of our covenanted brother Harold Roland (Servant Branch) who died December 28 2010 at the age of 94 it’s crystal-clear that serving the Lord with joy was one of his mightiest gifts. Many of us have been long-term beneficiaries of his servant’s heart. Harold was born in 1916 and raised in Minneapolis. With the exception of a short stint in the Aleutian Islands with the Army during World War II he never ventured far from home. He graduated from North High School in 1935 but was unable to continue his education. During the bank failures in the ‘30s his parents had lost the money they were saving for his college tuition. Undeterred Harold got himself a job at a freight warehouse and ran a crew unloading boxcars. He said “For my age the pay was good but I didn’t see any future in it for me.” Through a friend he found out that the interior decorator at Boutell Brothers furniture store was working many hours of overtime. Harold contacted him and offered to help. His boldness got him a job along with expert tutoring in the new field of interior design. Via night classes and his boss’s mentoring Harold quickly caught the vision of how to become a very successful interior designer. Eventually Dayton’s department store hired him and he retired from there in June 1982. Just before beginning his service in the Army Harold was in the hospital because of complications from an appendectomy. A student nurse came to the door of his room and said hello. Her name was Dolores. They shared married life together beginning June 20 1949 and raised four daughters: Kathy Mary Patricia and Joanne. Harold and Dolores started attending Thursday night prayer meetings at Regina High School and in 1975 joined Servants of the Light Community (which later became Servant Branch). They made the covenant of the People of Praise on January 27 1985. Other family members in the community are their daughter Patricia Ficker and her husband Pat and grandchildren Dan Ficker Laura Ficker Lisa Ficker and Catherine Ficker. Harold and Dolores usually served their brothers and sisters together (with the possible exception of the many wedding cakes Dolores made). They worked in the bookstores at numerous charismatic prayer meetings and conferences including the Notre Dame conferences and the Kansas City conference in 1977.  In 1982 (remember this was the year Harold retired) they began managing the dinner theater presentations that the branch put on to entertain community members and guests which had a total attendance of more than 5000 over three and a half years. In 1989 they volunteered to manage one of the branch’s fundraising concession booths at the Metrodome. Until 1992 they worked all the home games for the Twins and the Vikings. Both were long-time members of the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit team and when the public meetings started they often invited guests. From 1993 to 1998 they were the volunteers in their area for the scrip program that benefits Trinity School at River Ridge. As a member of Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church Harold asked to be healed of his fear of speaking in public so he could do Scripture readings at Mass. At his high-rise building he set up a Sunday Communion service for the residents where he would give a short sharing. He said that thinking praying and writing reflections kept him sharp. Harold and Dolores’s daughter Mary compiled the pooled memories of her sisters and the rest of the family for a sharing at the funeral Mass. Here are some excerpts. “From an early age Dad lived according to his guiding principle of seeking God’s will in his life. When we would ask him about doing something (after his response in our childhood years of ‘Go ask your mother’) his usual reply was ‘I’ll pray about it and let you know what I believe God wants us to do.’ “Although dad was kind and loving throughout our lives he developed a new relationship with God in his late 50s [when he was baptized in the Spirit] that changed his life. He felt God’s love and peace in his heart. . . . He chose to commit the rest of his life to learning about how to love himself and others with God’s love. He went from being a shy and reserved man to one who wanted to hug everyone. “He saw that mom had been supporting him and our family while he worked day and night at his career. So his motto became ‘Whatever Dolores wants Dolores gets.’ He began a whole new habit of serving mom’s needs and desires. Fortunately after he retired at 65 he had lots more time to support mom all of us kids and grandkids. He began this focus when mom was still healthy so he helped her go places and experience things she had always wanted to do. Later this changed into his entire time being spent in loving care for her as she experiences the stages of Alzheimer’s disease. “Fortunately for him throughout all the years of his married life he existed as a team with mom. In their enjoyment of each other and their mutual attention to detail they functioned like a well-oiled machine. After his retirement—for most of these last 30 years—he and mom together continuously served the church the community and those around them. It got to the point that I would have to get on their schedule to come over for dinner! “Dad served because he felt this was the way he could express the love he felt in his heart. His heart’s desire was to help others know the love of God as he had come to know it.” Harold turned 94 last December 1 and he spent a wonderful Christmas with his family. He drove himself to church on December 26 and went into the emergency room on the 27th because he wasn’t feeling well. In the peace of Christ he died with family members by his side on December 28.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2262
2252,Feb. 2 2012 10:38 a.m.,Leonard Beskar (Servant Branch),By Ed Mertz  Leonard Beskar (center). After a long battle with ill health and chronic pain our brother Leonard Beskar (Servant Branch) died of congestive heart failure on October 4 2010 a few weeks shy of his 76th birthday. Extended illness late in life had sapped the strength from a once rugged frame but was unable to rob this good man of his faith generosity and good humor. Leonard was born on October 25 1934 the third child of Leo and Mildred Beskar who farmed in the Big River area of western Wisconsin. Leonard lost his mother to tuberculosis just 14 months into his life and he and his two older siblings were sent to live with relatives since his dad was unable to run the farm and care for small children at the same time. The family reunited four years later when his father remarried. St. Mary's of Big River a Catholic parish that serves the rural community of the area played a significant role throughout Leonard's life. There he was baptized confirmed and educated; there he served as an altar boy and later a member of the parish council and there he was laid to rest in the little cemetery that sits beside the church. Farming too played a key role. By the time he was seven or eight Leonard was milking cows each day and working the fields each summer. He took up farming full-time after high school working alongside his father from whom he would later purchase the operation. For several years Leonard lived the life of a bachelor farmer. But one night in 1959 he escaped his chores long enough to attend a mixer for Catholic singles in St. Paul. There he laid eyes on Judy Kemp a transplanted Iowa farm girl. What he didn't realize immediately was that his gaze had fallen on what was perhaps the only non-Catholic girl in attendance. Consequently their courtship involved a serious exploration of their denominational differences. These discussions led to Judy's embrace of Catholicism and a trip to the altar. Their marriage was blessed with seven children three of whom are members of Servant Branch: Dave Beskar Cathy Miller and Theresa Krueger. In 1974 life took a decisive turn for Leonard and Judy when they learned about charismatic renewal. Leonard was immediately drawn in and was soon baptized in the Holy Spirit and attending prayer meetings in Hastings Minnesota. A year or two later the Beskars were in the first group from Wisconsin to join what was then known as Servants of the Light and is now Servant Branch. Life in a household followed in the late 1970s. Throughout the 1980s Leonard played a key pastoral role in area life serving for a time as an area coordinator. The kindness of the man was evident to those he pastored. Jim Jacoby for example remembers his former head as a very good listener and one with whom he could discuss anything. Leonard was well suited for family life and fatherhood. His daughter Mary Beth Brang recalls her father's tenderness and their capacity to communicate with few words. She recalls times riding into town with him silently hoping for some special purchase. Leonard was too attentive to miss the unspoken request and too much of a softy to let it go unmet. About the time they were ready to leave the store he'd say “Beth go get it” whatever “it” was. All who knew Leonard were attracted to his good humor–how fond he was of a good joke how easily moved to mirth. Often the latter got in the way of the former the result of an inability to keep from breaking up long enough to finish the joke. The infectiousness of his laughter made up for the imperfect presentation evoking a similar response from listeners who had never heard the punch line. Leonard was also a terrific farmer. He was always eager to tackle new ideas and employ better methods. He was a very early adopter of practices to preserve the soil such as contour farming to prevent runoff and crop rotation to mitigate soil depletion. He was also a wizard with a wrench able to fix the most complex pieces of farm machinery. The last quarter of Leonard's life was difficult due to chronic pain triggered by prostate surgery. Since he was unable to attend community functions branch visitors brought community life to him. On his better days they encountered the old Leonard a man eager to share a good joke and always they found a kind and gentle man one faithful in prayer for their needs and faithful to his Lord as well. Prayer and study filled his day. Chronic pain could not silence his praise of a Lord he knew to be good and steadfast a fact noted in Mary Beth's eulogy when she honored him for his fidelity to the lyrics of one of his favorite Christian songs: El Shaddai El ShaddaiErkamka na AdonaiI will praise you till I dieEl Shaddai.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2252
2239,Jan. 19 2012 12:44 p.m.,A Milestone for Yodit Derese,"By Chris Meehan  Yodit Derese In June 2010 Yodit Derese traveled to the US from her native Ethiopia for a surgery to correct a club foot. Her sister Naomi had already been adopted by Eric and Hilary Shreves (Vancouver-Portland) and Yodit too became part of the Shreves family though at 26 she is too old to be legally adopted. A lifelong Christian with deep faith she also joined the People of Praise. (Her story appeared in the winter 2011 issue of Vine & Branches). Recently Yodit reached a significant milestone in her quest to remain in the US permanently. The US government has recommended that Yodit's application for asylum be approved. Once this approval becomes final she can apply for a green card (permanent residency). Receiving a green card would mean that Yodit could become a US citizen. ""I have seen God work in power many times"" Eric says ""but this whole story is one of the greatest miracles I have ever witnessed."" The recommendation of approval came about through dogged work by Hilary and the help of a Portland immigration lawyer Theresa Statler. A staff member for US Senator Ron Wyden recommended the lawyer to Hilary and suggested seeking asylum for Yodit under a special provision for members of persecuted social groups. “I remember the day Yodit and I sat talking to the lawyer for the first time” Hilary says. “I noticed works of art from all over the world on the walls of her office especially Asia and Africa gifts from grateful clients. When she explained all the work involved--weekly meetings for three or four months--I began mentally calculating the enormous expense the effort would require. I had no idea how we could afford it.” To Yodit and Hilary’s surprise Ms. Statler paused and said that she sometimes took cases pro bono. She volunteered to work on Yodit’s case for free. Ms. Statler and her legal team found two professors who had documented the miserable and even dangerous conditions women with disabilities can face in Ethiopia which buttressed her case for asylum. Yodit is presently attending school and learning English and has made friends with other Ethiopian immigrants. “Life in the United States--I love it!” she says. “I love living with my sister Naomi and with the Shreves family. My foot hurts sometimes but it’s in very good shape now. Praise God!”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2239
2237,Jan. 19 2012 12:39 p.m.,A Soldier's Life Is Saved,"By Chris Meehan US Army specialist Joe Ridenour (Oahu) has been recommended for a commendation for helping save the life of a friend and fellow soldier. Joe’s urgent phone call led to the rescue of a soldier who had attempted suicide near an army base 2500 miles away from Joe’s station at Scofield Barracks Hawaii. The 26-year-old soldier says “I’m terribly grateful to God for such good friends like Joe.” Joe vividly remembers the events of Saturday November 19. That morning he called his friend Mark Morris (not his real name) who lives near Fort Lewis in Washington State. (The two had met and become friends during communications signal training in Georgia.) Mark told Joe he’d done some heavy drinking by himself on previous weekends but he brushed it off and said that he was just trying to stay out of trouble. Joe was concerned but not overly worried. ""Things didn't seem out of control"" he recalls. Later in the day Joe received several text messages from Mark indicating that he had begun drinking again. Joe decided to call and ask what was wrong. Already drunk Mark responded angrily ""Nothing's wrong!"" The conversation didn't go well and Joe didn't expect to hear from him again. But then he received more text messages. One said ""I'm sorry.” Another said""Tell [name] all is forgiven.” Joe wrote back ""What's going on?"" ""I'm fine"" Mark replied ""Don't worry about it. Everything is taken care of."" The tone of resignation in the messages rang alarm bells with Joe who had taken suicide prevention classes as part of his Army training. He called Mark again but Mark didn’t answer and the text messages had also stopped. Joe couldn't be sure that Mark was going to commit suicide but he says “the Lord gave me the grace to overcome my pride and take the risk of looking foolish if I had misread the situation."" He called Josh Pruitt a soldier at Fort Lewis and a mutual friend and convinced him to take immediate action. After calling Mark and receiving no answer Josh dialed 911 and the operator dispatched paramedics. They found Mark unconscious on the floor of his home. He had swallowed all the medicine in his medicine cabinet. Mark was in intensive care for three days. He remembers waking up in the hospital in a bit of a panic because an oxygen tube was running down his throat but he doesn’t remember any of the events of November 19. “I’ve always believed in Christ” says Mark but his faith had grown shaky and he says he had become more interested in parties than God. “Now my priorities have changed. I’ve opened up to see the blessing of friends and to see what’s going on in the world and in myself. Overall I still have difficult times but I also see the blessings. “I’m attending substance abuse classes and Alcoholics Anonymous several times a week. My prayer life is daily instead of weekly or monthly. I’m very open about the experience always the first to talk about it if it ever comes up. I shamelessly tell the story. It’s in my past--not my future!” Joe says he and Mark talk on the phone weekly. “We are much much closer friends.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2237

(Photo courtesy of Greg Walters.) By Chris Meehan Troop 77 a Boy Scout troop sponsored by the Muncie branch celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. With 42 boys the troop is larger than it has ever been. Members just learned that their scoutmaster Pete Walters (Muncie) will receive the highest honor a volunteer can earn from the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America--the Silver Beaver. Awarded for “outstanding service to young people over an extended period of time both in Scouting and within the community at large” the Silver Beaver will be presented at a luncheon on January 21 at Warren Central High School in Indianapolis. Pete was one of 16 to receive the award from a pool of 10000 eligible volunteers according to the Crossroads of America council of the Boy Scouts. Pete and fellow branch leaders Alan Habansky and Tom Schmitt founded the troop in 1986 as a way for the Muncie branch of the People of Praise to serve its sons. “An Eagle Scout for the past 44 years Pete knows what Boy Scouting can do for our young boys to help them become the young men of God that we want them to become” says principal branch coordinator Jim Schenkel. Six years ago the troop nearly dissolved after membership dwindled to five boys. Pete says the boys deserve much of the credit for its resurgence. “I came up to the boys” Pete remembers “and said ‘Look guys I’m busy with a lot of things at home at work and in the People of Praise. Scouts are boy-led. What are you going to do about growing?’” One of the scouts Taylor Davis suggested that they pray for more members. The boys committed t hemselves to regular individual and joint prayer and they took advantage of every opportunity the Lord provided. Scout Peter Coleman (Mission Division Evansville) remembers discussing the matter that summer with scouts from another troop who were helping him on his Eagle project. It turned out that troop was also down to six members and losing its scoutmaster. After some discussion those boys and their two assistant leaders joined Troop 77 doubling its size. Since then more boys keep coming each year. “I might not be receiving this award now if those guys hadn’t prayed and taken the initiative” says Pete. Troop 77 is known for its big backpacking trips to places like Colorado and the Upper Peninsula says Terry Bomkamp a former Muncie scout leader who has moved to the Rockford branch. He joins Troop 77 each year for the event handling logistics for the group. “When I think of Pete I think of his genuine desire to have a strong personal relationship with each of the scouts” says troop alumnus Taylor Davis. “I have experienced some of the most difficult times of my life on my high adventure trips with Pete. He is a role model for me and exemplifies a strong character every day.” Son and fellow Eagle Scout Justin Walters (Mission Division Indianapolis) notes that his father is the kind of leader who instituted a penalty of pushups for each time a scout showed up at a meeting without his uniform--and then joined the offender in performing the penalty. “Our group is a well-mannered gang of all kinds of boys from different churches different  backgrounds and families” Pete says. “Troop 77 has not only brought them together as brothers it’s attracting their fathers as well. Five of them are meeting with five of us men in the branch for an ad hoc sort of men’s group that meets twice a month. They love sharing their lives with one another and they’re telling their friends who are asking us about it. Who knows where it will end?”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2216
2178,Nov. 14 2011 12:26 p.m.,Six Make the Covenant in Appleton,"by Chris Meehan  From left: Ken Haen Egide Nimubona Revocate Niyizonkiza Fred and Dorothy Gedemer Emily Siebers and David Sklorenko. Photo credit: Ruth Schmelzer Six members of the Appleton branch made the covenant of the People of Praise on October 22. They include a married couple from Africa a married couple in their 80s a retired heavy equipment operator and a single woman who met the community through a church choir. ""The fact that this diverse group of people all found what they were looking for in the People of Praise speaks to the strength of our community life"" says Steve Pable head of the branch leaders team. Egide Nimubona and Revocate Niyizonkiza both grew up in Burundi. They met and married in Canada before a job change for Egide brought the couple to Appleton in 2002. Two months after their arrival they went to the Appleton airport to celebrate with their friends and fellow African immigrants Peter and Ana Vakunta who were welcoming their children to the US from Cameroon. The Vakuntas are members of the Appleton branch and so many branch members were also on hand. Their enthusiasm made an impression. ""When I saw tears in the eyes of some of you waiting for those children I thought this is not a normal group!"" Egide says. ""I knew right away that this was the group for me."" Revocate says she was not looking forward to starting over again in Appleton after leaving friends and family behind in Canada. But the fact that community members call one another ""brother"" and ""sister"" made an immediate impression on her. ""My brothers and sisters in the community have embraced me and accepted me the same way my biological brothers and sisters do."" Fred and Dorothy Gedemer were neighbors for more than 30 years who married after their spouses died. Between them they have 10 children 34 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren ""and we've only been married for 10 years!"" Fred quips. The Gedemers heard about the People of Praise from several branch members who were with them on a group trip to Israel. ""We found the way the community thinks about the importance of serving others was a good fit with our perspective on serving. We're like-minded in that way"" Fred says. The only Appleton native in the group Emily Siebers works for the book printer R.R. Donnelley. She heard about the community from branch members in her church choir. ""My favorite part of community life is simply going to the weekly meeting and talking to my friends"" she says. ""Actually everyone in the group is a friend of mine!"" Ken Haen is retired from a career in heavy equipment that had him digging lakes in Florida mining in Kentucky and building coal ships that travel the Great Lakes. He moved to Appleton for work in 2005 leaving behind close friends from a prayer group in Milwaukee. Like the Gedemers he met David Lee and other branch members on a trip to Israel. ""When we got back from the trip we had a party at the community center"" Ken remembers. ""I saw that this was what I had been looking for a group where everybody looked out for everybody and you all had Jesus in your hearts."" ""We all experienced so much joy when these six brothers and sisters made the covenant at our anniversary banquet"" Steve adds. ""We felt joy for each person making the covenant and joy for ourselves as these brothers and sisters committed their lives to us.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2178
2164,Oct. 31 2011 4:13 p.m.,“Tell Everyone What God Did for Me”,By Chris MeehanAn Allendale woman was healed of back and neck pain after community members prayed with her.In September Miss Betty arrived at Ruthanne Seitz's house for their weekly Bible study wincing and rubbing her neck and shoulder. She was one of the first to arrive so Ruthanne and Patti Deakin (Allendale) began to pray with her—until their prayer was interrupted by a ringing doorbell and then a phone call.  On her way out of the house after the Bible Study Miss Betty ran into Ruthanne's husband Ron who also prayed for her.The next morning Ron went was on his regular morning walk through the neighborhood which took him by Miss Betty’s house. She was out in her yard by the fence.“How are you feeling today?” Ron asked.“Not very good!” said Miss Betty. “All your prayers yesterday helped but I still feel pretty bad. It was so hard to get out of bed this morning and it really hurts to turn my head from side to side.”Ron walked over. “May I pray for you again?”Miss Betty nodded so Ron laid his arm around her shoulders and asked God to take away the pain. Then he continued on his walk.The next week when Betty arrived for the Bible study Ruthanne asked her how her neck and shoulder were. Betty described what had happened when Ron prayed with her: “Ron put his arm on my shoulder and when his hand touched my shoulder blade heat came from his hand and went into me. His hand was really really hot! Suddenly I could raise my shoulders without bringing tears to my eyes! And I could turn my head from side to side once again.”Several weeks later she told Patti that the pain had not returned. “Tell everyone what God did for me!” she said.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2164
2151,Oct. 31 2011 4:09 p.m.,"""Now I’m Not Limping""",By Chris MeehanAn Evansville man who had been seriously hurt in a motorcycle accident had his ankle pain and limp disappear when three People of Praise missionaries prayed with him.Five minutes before the end of a recent missionary outing David Frank Mary Timler and David Zimmel spotted Michael a man with a limp walking to his car.David Zimmel approached him with a question: “Have you ever seen a miracle?”“It’s a miracle I’m even alive!” Michael replied.He said that he had been badly injured in a motorcycle accident. Several successful surgeries had rebuilt his neck but a smashed ankle was still causing him extreme pain.“God can finish the healing” offered David.“Doctors say it’s not fixable” Michael replied.“God can heal you” David repeated before telling three stories of people he knew who were healed of problems with their knees or feet–including himself.“You mean you’re going to lay your hands on me and my feet will stop hurting?”“Yes!” David said.“Well it can’t hurt to try.”The three missionaries prayed over Michael. Afterward he got up and took two steps that he said were pain-free. David asked if he could walk without a limp. He took about 20 balanced even steps. Michael appeared amazed but skeptical.  “He left with a quizzical expression on his face” David said.A week or so later Mary went back to the same place and met a woman who said she was Michael’s girlfriend. She said Michael hadn’t complained about pain since the day he had been prayed with but he remained perplexed by the healing. “Have you ever seen the Lord do anything?” Michael had asked her.Another neighbor told David that he had seen the missionaries pray with Michael and seen him walking afterward. Michael had approached him and asked him whether he believed in God. “It’s the weirdest thing” Michael told the neighbor. “They prayed over me and now I’m not limping.”“It’s fairly common for people not to know how to respond to a healing” says David “but I enjoy seeing the Lord surprise people. I’ve told this story around 10 times since then when praying with people and they’ve been getting healed.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2151
2125,Oct. 6 2011 4:22 p.m.,Ecumenism: What I Learned from My Father,"By John Xenakis (South Bend) My understanding of ecumenism comes from my father Christopher. He grew up in Little Greece in Downtown Chicago and was raised Greek Orthodox. (While growing up my family had Orthodox icons of Jesus on top of our television. My grandma would walk up to them and kiss the pictures as we tried to watch TV.) When my dad went to college in the late 60s he met people in Campus Crusade for Christ a Christian Organization. He joined a Protestant Church and continued going to Orthodox church with the family. After finishing his undergraduate degree my father went to a Baptist seminary in Portland Oregon where he met my mom who was raised Lutheran. After preaching in Arizona in 1983 he became a Navy chaplain-- a pivotal time in my father's life. He saw chaplains working together on the base and on the ships in order to draw more strength from their unity and it effectively drew more people into worship services. Those 15 years as a chaplain certainly brought about his ecumenism. I never heard the word ecumenical until I met the People of Praise but my dad would always say ""If I meet a Catholic I want to help him become a better Catholic. Same goes with Orthodox or Protestant denominations. My message is Jesus."" Rev. Christopher Xenakis still works in ministry as a Pastor for two smaller churches in Cortland NY and I still enjoy his sermons and the church community.  My mom and dad have been to several People of Praise meetings and functions and they fully appreciate our worship and our work together in ecumenism.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2125
2129,Oct. 6 2011 4:18 p.m.,Images of Ecumenism,By Harold Coulter (Servant Branch) I have been in the People of Praise here in the Twin Cities for the last 37 years first as a Presbyterian and now a Lutheran and have had many ecumenical moments. Here I will share one that relates directly to the most recent issue of Vine and Branches.  The 1910 World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh Scotland is credited with launching the ecumenical movement. Photo credit: WCC/Peter Williams I was at an ecumenical conference at the University of St. Thomas during the summer of 2010 and the image of the 1910 World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh Scotland was shown on the screen at one of the presentations.The conference was sponsored by St. Paul Seminary and presenters were Protestant and Catholic theologians who have been involved in various ecumenical dialogues over many years. It was also a celebration of 100 years of ecumenical dialogue that began at that conference in Edinburgh. Those conference attendees were almost all from various Protestant denominations though there were some Roman Catholic observers. I remember being struck by the significance of that meeting as I looked at and thought about the image of the conference.  Around 100 Protestant and Orthodox observers attended meetings of the Second Vatican Council held at St. Peter’s Basilica from 1962 to 1965. They had some of the best seats in the house near the altar on the right side. Photo courtesy of Catholic News Service. A few months later we in Servant Branch saw a multi-media presentation that Joel Kibler and others put together. The image of the Edinburgh conference was in it as well as an image from Vatican II. Later I saw the presentation again at the Pastoral Training Institute in South Bend only this time someone pointed out something about the Vatican II image that moved me. Way down in the front on the right side as you view it there were about 100 Protestant and Orthodox observers seated in places of honor. Just as those observers were honored in Rome I feel honored to be a part of what God is doing ecumenically here in People of Praise.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2129
2111,Sept. 23 2011 6:54 p.m.,In Portland Trinity Academy Opens Its Doors,By Chris Meehan  Trinity Academy opened its doors on September 6 with five students. Jo Clark (third from right) is the head of school. Trinity Academy a school founded by the Vancouver-Portland branch opened its doors for the first time on September 6.  That morning five ninth-graders and their parents walked into hurriedly painted classrooms in the basement of Northminster Presbyterian Church in Portland. Charlie Fraga principal branch coordinator for Vancouver-Portland was there to greet the students and parents along with branch member Jo Clark the head of school. Two weeks before the school opened the students and parents had a surprise when the location they had been planning to use for the school suddenly fell through. After a rapid review of potential sites some school board members discovered that a church they had previously tried to contact Northminster Presbyterian had space available. “We toured it the same day we heard about it and immediately saw the possibilities” says Jo “a 1500-square-foot area with three classrooms.”They signed a two-year lease but that left only seven days before school opened to paint and prepare the classrooms. “Over half the branch volunteered to help out with the painting” Charlie says. Several students also pitched in to prepare the classrooms.They moved the furniture in on the sixth day and on the seventh day students arrived for their first day of class. The students and teachers are following an adaptation of the Trinity School curriculum though Trinity Academy is not a campus of Trinity School. Branch leaders hope the academy will grow toward that goal. “The students have good attitudes and they’re willing to learn and work hard” Jo says. “We’ve really gotten off to a very good start.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2111
2095,Sept. 23 2011 5:11 p.m.,New People of Praise Logo,Chris Meehan (South Bend) has won the community’s logo design competition. His winning entry incorporates tongues of fire hands raised in praise and the words “People of Praise Christian Community.” He developed two versions: a standard design and a 40th anniversary version. His designs are a modification and updating of a logo created by Chuck Strantz for the community’s 25th anniversary. “I want to thank all the brothers and sisters who submitted logo designs” said Craig Lent who had announced the competition in April on behalf of the community’s board of governors. “I’m grateful for all the hard work and creativity that went into every design that was submitted. I look forward to seeing all the creative ways our new logo will be put to use across the community as we continue celebrating our 40th anniversary.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2095
2082,Sept. 19 2011 11:47 a.m.,Back Healed in Allendale,Marty Mertz (Photo credit: Abby Olson) When 17-year-old Marty Mertz (Colorado Springs) volunteered to spend last summer as a counselor at the Allendale summer camp she knew that back pain might make for some challenging days. She didn’t expect God to take her pain away. Marty who grew up in Servant Branch was diagnosed with a mild case of scoliosis (curvature of the spine) at age 7 but pain became a regular part of her life after a back strain she suffered at Servant Camp in 2010. After that she had difficulty sitting down and doing some physical activities: “I couldn’t help my friends in Action with the cleaning jobs we do to raise money” she says. Marty’s doctor told her that her spine was getting worse slowly twisting into a C shape. The pain might be with her for the rest of her life. For her first two weeks in Allendale Marty played it safe--supervising camp activities rather than participating in them. But when the team gathered in small groups to pray for one another’s needs she asked them to pray for her back. “I just wish I could touch my toes” she told them. Nathan Barrett (Allendale) asked her to bend over and show the others how far she could reach. “Her fingertips came six or eight inches short of her toes” he says. After they laid hands on her and prayed Marty tried again and stretched her hands a few inches farther than before. The group prayed a second time then Marty bent over again. “When she reached down her fingers reached to her toes and she pressed them flat against the floor” says Nathan. “It was exciting. We were laughing and cheering and praising God” adds Sheila Timler (South Bend). “The Lord did more than I asked” Marty says. “Not long after I found myself able to sit in an office chair three hours at a time. I’ve had temporary muscle soreness due to my body adjusting to standing and walking properly but that’s all.” Marty shared the story at a Shreveport branch meeting and afterward Bill Parker a pediatrician offered to examine her back. After a quick exam he told her “Your back is straight. I can’t find any evidence of scoliosis—and that’s not the kind of thing that just disappears on its own.” Marty lives with Eric and Mary Faith Hall (Colorado Springs) and works taking care of their children. “Between the Halls Hrbaceks and the Brophys there are 14 community kids on the block—so it’s a very physical job but now I’m able to enjoy activities like that” she says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2082

2065,Sept. 15 2011 11:31 a.m.,United in Prayer,By Anne Brewer (South Bend) A moment that comes to mind is when I went to the hospital to visit my sister Pam Peterson (South Bend) who had been very sick for a week. I walked into her room and her husband Ken was kneeling next to her bed praying. I joined in praying with all my heart for her healing. I could feel the presence of the Lord very powerfully. It was a moment of union with the Lord and with Ken in our common desire for Pam's healing. I was well aware that Ken had done this many times at other bedsides as he is a Lutheran minister. I felt like the Lord sent me along to shore him up. I am a Roman Catholic and this chance to be so united in prayer was very memorable. Being ecumenical is something I take for granted. It is so great to become more aware of the gift of having life in common with others of different denominations.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2065
2061,Sept. 13 2011 10:30 a.m.,Praying Together in Household,By Jill Boughton In 1977 our family (at that time John and Jill Boughton Eric and eventually baby Lydia) and the Timler family (Mark and Ginny John and Peter) shared a house for five months while the Timlers were between houses. At the time we were Catholic and they were Episcopalian but that didn't hinder our ability to pray together and joyfully share life. One evening their pastor joined us for dinner. In the course of the conversation we learned that in New Jersey he had both learned his catechism from John's grandfather and attended an Episcopal seminary with my uncle!

2055,Sept. 8 2011 10:06 a.m.,An Encounter with Pentecostals That Changed My Life,"By Tom Duddy Sr. (Oahu) I grew up in a traditional Catholic home in New Jersey. My parents were good church members and involved in the local parish. But by the time I was in eighth grade I found myself asking Is this all there is--going to church one day a week?  I hoped for more but I didn’t know what the more was. One day I saw something on TV about Jesus freaks--hippies for Jesus who read the Bible and had bell-bottom trousers and long hair. (This was in 1969.) I thought Gosh they look like they’re excited about their faith. I'd like to be excited about my faith. The summer after eighth grade I ran into some people my age who were passing out leaflets for an Assemblies of God revival meeting. “We want you to come to this meeting tonight” they said. I wondered if they were like the Jesus freaks I saw on TV. I decided to go. The meeting was scheduled to start at 7:00 and I had to ride my bike five miles to get there. About 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon it started pouring rain. I made an agreement with the Lord. I said Lord if you want me to go it has got to stop raining by 5:00. About two minutes before 5:00 the rain stopped so I got on my bike and started the ride. Then about 10 minutes later--just a downpour! I arrived at the church soaking wet. I sat at the very back. I was just going to observe. The music was very enthusiastic. People were clapping their hands shouting things. I liked what I saw. I wanted what they had. The service went on for quite a while and then the minister the revival guy gets up. I figure Oh no they’re getting ready to end the service but nothing’s happened to me yet! I was a very quiet and shy person but I felt myself get up on my feet in front of about 300 people and call out to minister “Excuse me sir! I see what you guys have and I want it but I don’t feel any different than when I walked in the door.” “Bring that young man up here!” (Later I found out that the service wasn’t ending he was getting ready to take the collection . . . but they never got around to it that night.) They brought me up to the altar had a couple of people kneel around me and they said “Tell the Lord you are sorry for your sins.” I repeated whatever they said. “Lord I am sorry for my sins.” “Start thanking the Lord.” As soon as I started thanking the Lord some funny syllables and sounds started coming out of my mouth. Someone yelled “Baptized in the Spirit and saved in the same night!” I didn’t understand either of those terms. In that moment I had an experience of how much God loved me. It was overwhelming. I went home and I told my poor parents who didn’t know what to think except they thought that the people at church had drugged me! I wanted to get more and more of this and so I started going back to the church every night.  (It was a week-long revival.) I went up to the revival leader a man named Jesse Owens. I said “I want to go with you guys. I want to do what you’re doing. I want to go on the road with you.” (I hadn’t talked to my parents about this yet.) He said “Let me pray about it.” The next day I went back and talked to Jesse. He said “I’ve been praying about this and this is what I think the Lord is telling you to do."" He read me a passage from Mark 6. “As Jesus was getting into the boat the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him. Jesus did not let him but said ‘Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.’” Then he said “I think you should go back to your family to your church and tell them what the Lord has done for you.” That really impressed me. Here they had a really interested convert to their own church but they said to go back and tell your family your people what the Lord has done for you. The next day my parents made me go to the Catholic priest and tell him what happened so that he could ""fix it"" or whatever.  I knocked on the rectory door and I told him my story and he said “I’ve heard of things like this and most of the people that I know who had the same experience as you ended up leaving the church and joining other churches. And I want you to think about this: If everyone who had the same experience that you had left the church how would our church learn about this?” He directed me to a home prayer meeting attended by Catholics from my parish. I got locked in with them. That led to me coming to a conference in South Bend where Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan preached. That led to learning about the People of Praise and eventually joining the community. *** Do you have a story to tell about ecumenism?

2045,Sept. 7 2011 8:45 p.m.,Six High Schoolers Spend Summer in Indy,"By Chris Meehan  The Action Summer Internship. Back from left: Chris Kadera Matt Rubio John Burke Paul Hommes Jonathan Willard. Front: George Kane David Gruber. Not pictured: Thomas Brophy Josiah Johnson John Loughran. Photo Credit: Trish Brewer Six high school boys from across the community spent their summers in Indianapolis for the first ever Action Summer Internship (ASI). The young men lived in a Christian household gained experience in carpentry and plumbing and served as a consistent and reliable backbone for visiting Action work crews. The chance to learn building skills drew Jonathan Willard 16 from Servant Branch. ""I came because I wanted time to learn how to actually accomplish stuff and not have to keep stopping and asking for directions” he said. His cousin 16-year-old Josiah Johnson also from Minnesota said his goal was to participate in as many Action trips as possible--in this case three. Most of the young men stayed in Indianapolis for six or eight weeks allowing them to work alongside multiple Action crews. George Kane (Indianapolis) a junior pre-med student at IUPUI  led the ASI with help from fellow college students David Gruber (Indianapolis) and Matt Rubio (northern Virginia). “We wanted to provide a concentrated experience of community life so we worked ate prayed and relaxed together. We also listened to several challenging talks a week by Walt Seale (Indianapolis)"" George said. “Sometimes we talked into the night after Walt’s presentations"" said John Loughran 17 from South Bend.  From left: Thomas Brophy David Gruber Jonathan Willard and Chris Taylor (Corvallis). Jonathan Willard who received the baptism in the Holy Spirit during the summer said he appreciated the opportunities for group and personal prayer that the internship afforded. ""I was surprised at what a spiritual experience the ASI was."" For John Burke an 18-year-old from the Rockford Illinois area the internship was an inspiration to move to Indianapolis permanently. John did not grow up in the community but first became interested in Action after hearing about it from C.J. Newburn (Rockford). He has since joined the college men's household in the Triangle and is working to establish Indiana residency so he can attend college in Indianapolis. He says a highlight of the summer was gutting two houses in preparation for renovation. “Destruction is my speciality!” he says proudly before recounting the day when he and David Gruber were given the task of removing a tree that had grown around and through a fence. “You’ll never get it out"" one of the more experienced team members remarked. “But we did—and in only two hours!"" John reports. Thomas Brophy 16 from Colorado Springs remembers helping John Burke clear debris from a recently purchased duplex. “We had given up cleaning on our first attempt because the stench inside from rotting animals was too strong” he says. Once they removed the decay and the place became tolerable the young men threw themselves into the work tearing up old carpets and filling up a dumpster with dirty smelly trash. Once in a while Thomas would let out a yell just for fun as he tore into something big heavy or especially grimy. “We accomplished all of our most important renovation objectives for the summer” says Paul Hommes (Indianapolis) who managed the Action work projects in Indianapolis. ""It wouldn’t have happened without these young men on the ASI. When we were short on adult men the last two weeks they took what they learned and rose to the occasion.” “I was impressed and encouraged by what all of us in Action were able to do” adds Chris Kadera 17 from Servant Branch. “The Lord can really use us!”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2045
2032,Sept. 7 2011 8:29 p.m.,Allendale Camp Hits Milestones,By Chris Meehan  Counselor Amy Rice (center) with Allendale girls. Photo credits: Marty Mertz The day camp for Allendale children held this summer set attendance milestones and kept the Action staff and volunteers hopping. Fifty-seven children came to the camp on its busiest day while attendence ranged from 30-40 on most days. “I just loved coming out onto the porch of our house on Yale during camp and seeing tons of kids interacting and having fun with laughter in the air” said Joan Pingel (Allendale) who led the effort. A staff of five worked all summer on the camp alongside Action volunteers. The girl campers made crafts cooked and learned praise dancing while boys had a Pinewood Derby-type competition and built a water rocket-launcher.  All the campers learned about Acts of the Apostles. The camp made use of a small brick house renovated by last summer’s Action teams. Staff member Sam Mertz (South Bend) says one of his highlights was leading eight boys on a fishing trip to Cross Lake an 8500-acre lake about three miles away. Some of the boys had never seen it and one boy was so intimidated by the water that he didn’t want to leave the van much less get close enough to the lake to fish. “If I fall in I’ll die” the boy said. Sam prayed with him for courage and he finally left the van. By the end of the trip he was happily fishing and saying that he wanted to come back again.  Allendale boys play with a parachute. Colleen Murray (Allendale) remembers a breakthrough with a girl camper who refused to participate in a knitting project. “I don’t want to do it! You can’t make me do it!” she told Colleen. “How about we set the timer for five minutes and I’ll help you for that time” Colleen proposed. The girl got the knack of it quickly. Colleen eventually turned the timer off and the girl kept on knitting while Colleen read aloud to the other girls. For the rest of the summer the girl asked to knit whenever she had the option and even asked her mother for a knitting kit. Patti Deakin (Allendale) met one of the girls walking home from camp one afternoon. “I asked her how her day was going and she said fine. I had seen her earlier and she was acting grumpy and sad. She said she had been really down when she got to camp but now she was happy. I asked her what had made the difference. She said “I remembered how Jeanette Zimmel had told me that I could choose to be happy or not. So I’m deciding to be happy. I really like it.” Camp staffers  have been teaching this for years and this girl was attending her fourth camp but that day she suddenly got it. Joan says this year’s camp succeeded because of groundwork laid during previous summers and throughout the school year. “The main thing is that a number of kids have been attending camp for several years so they know how we expect them to behave. Also in recent years we’ve been able to work with the girls all year which helps build stronger relationships.” Neighbor Claudia Stephens said she appreciated all the care Action team members showed by walking the neighborhood children to and from camp each day. “I want my son to come to camp because of the difference I’ve seen it make for my neighbor’s son when he hangs around y’all” another neighborhood man said.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2032

1986,July 22 2011 9:03 p.m.,Young Man Rebounds After Immune System Attack,By Chris Meehan  Joe Walker (Photo credit: Marty Mertz) Joe Walker a 15-year-old in the northern Virginia branch has rebounded from a dangerous attack on his immune system that struck him in early June. By July he was hard at work repairing homes in Allendale. “This was a mighty work of God” his mother Carrie says. On a Friday afternoon in early June Joe and Carrie had sat in the hematologist’s (blood specialist) office where they learned that Joe’s white cell count had dropped down to .78. Normal is around 4. Joe effectively had no immune system which made him vulnerable to infection. The doctor recommended he stay away from crowds for the weekend which meant missing graduation parties and the branch’s Pentecost meeting. Upon hearing the news Joe’s father Steve left a meeting at the Pentagon to be with his family. The first signs of trouble had come earlier in the week. For two nights in a row Joe had slept only fitfully and woke up aching all over particularly his head and jaw. “I felt miserable” Joe says “so it was a blessing that I had a doctor’s appointment already scheduled.” The doctor thought his symptoms could indicate Lyme disease West Nile virus or even meningitis. Then a blood test revealed that Joe’s white blood cell count registered at half of normal. Perplexed the doctor sent him home with instructions for Carrie to keep watch for signs of meningitis. Around midnight Joe’s headache and the pain in his jaw both worsened and he started having a fever and tremors so Carrie took him into the emergency room. Tests ruled out meningitis but Joe’s white cell count had dropped even lower. Though he thought it might be a virus the E.R. doctor also prescribed antibiotics. They returned home in the early hours of Friday morning. Later that day was their encounter with the hematologist who recommended that Joe get tested for leukemia the next Monday. Over the weekend Carrie Steve their four other children still at home plus three household members prayed over Joe for healing. Principal branch coordinator Lek Kadeli and his son Gjon came to pray as well. Monday several other branch members met Joe at the hospital to pray with him. “By then I was feeling pretty good” he says. A blood sample taken before doctors began the bone marrow biopsy procedure revealed that Joe’s blood cell count had risen to over 3. “The doctor seemed surprised” said Carrie “and my mouth hung open.”  The bone marrow biopsy showed no sign of leukemia or anything else wrong. At one point later Carrie asked the hematologist “So can I classify this as a miracle? Many people were praying for Joe.” “People have very different ways of looking at things” the doctor replied. She explained that a virus could attack one’s immune system and lower one’s white blood count but then it usually doesn’t drop as low as it did in Joe’s case nor would it bump up so high so quickly. Both changes surprised her. After a few days Joe said he felt pretty much normal. “I think it must have been a virus that caused the problem” he says “and I feel like God had something to do with me getting well.” Carrie agrees saying “God’s hand was all over the situation using all kinds of people to protect us every step of the way.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1986
1984,July 22 2011 9:02 p.m.,Chris Dietz Survives Dangerous Infection,By Chris Meehan  Chris Dietz Chris Dietz (northern Virginia) a 45-year-old husband and father of two has survived a bout with a rare flesh-eating bacteria that typically kills one in four of its victims. The bacterial infection known as necrotizing fasciitis destroys skin fat and the tissue covering muscles and can lead to amputation of infected limbs. It’s unclear how Chris first came in contact with the bacteria. The infection began suddenly on February 16. Chris woke up with his left hand swollen to twice its normal size. “My pain and misery increased throughout the day and you could see red streaks radiating from my hand up my arm.” The doctor he saw that evening had him admitted to the hospital immediately. The trouble only increased during his first 24 hours in the hospital. The doctors determined that the infected area needed to be surgically cleaned out immediately before the infection reached his heart. His lungs were also affected says his wife Gina and his breathing became so labored doctors had to intubate him and put him in the ICU. “The whole thing was happening so quickly it was a shock to those of us who see him every day” Gina says. “The doctor told me ‘This doesn’t look very good; it’s serious and we’ll need to watch him closely.’” Rick Ridenour the coordinator for Chris’s area spread the word quickly and soon many people in the branch were praying. A number of people came to the hospital that evening to pray and sing with Chris. He started to breathe better as Thursday evening wore on and in the middle of the night woke up feeling much better. During the next two weeks Chris had two more surgeries: one to clean out infected and deteriorating tissue and another to sew his arm back up. He recovered so well that his doctors canceled plans for further reconstructive plastic surgery. “I’m amazed at the confidence I had in the Lord” says Chris. “I had no fear at all even though there were risks of amputation or death. That was a grace from God. In my mind there was no chance it wouldn’t work out.” Chris says the prayers of his brothers and sisters in the People of Praise played a big part in his recovery. “I was talking to the Lord about it all and I heard him say ‘Chris let me tell you what happened.’ Then I saw a vision of a kind of shield at the top of my left arm which protected my heart from the infection. The Lord said ‘That shield was the prayers of the people of your branch.’ ” “The situation seemed so precarious” adds Bill Brophy “that all of us in the branch prayed with extra fervor. We felt like Aaron and Hur who had responsibility for holding up Moses’ arms to win the battle.” (Ex. 17:12). “Of course the whole time the branch gave us tons of other support as well” says Chris “taking care of our kids and providing for meals laundry and housecleaning. I loved all the visitors. We’re back to normal. I’ve returned to my job as a senior budget analyst for the EPA. I was in physical therapy for my hand and it’s fully functional despite having fewer tendons. My wounds are healed and the array of scars on my left arm is actually quite impressive! My doctors say I have nothing to worry about.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1984
1953,July 3 2011 10:37 p.m.,Tenth Summer of Action Work Underway,By Chris Meehan In June Action volunteers from around the community took to the road for their tenth summer of work projects. The teams began major renovations to two Indianapolis homes started a series of repair projects for Allendale neighbors and restarted the annual summer camp for Allendale children. This year’s camp has already broken previous attendance records. “Forty-three kids showed up for opening day” says Catherine Bulger of the Allendale summer staff “about 10 more than last year’s opening day. Our second day was larger than the biggest day last summer and our third day we surpassed even that: 57 kids.” Attendance is expected to increase again after summer school sessions let out. “The higher number of kids forced us to stretch and regroup a bit” adds Ben Reinhardt leader of the Action efforts in Allendale this year. “But the summer is off to a great start.” Ben and other staff members lined up 12 home-repair projects for Allendale neighbors and they are also planning improvements to some of the properties owned by Christians in Mission team members on Yale Avenue. The crew really appreciated the experience of Ed Konczesky (Tampa) who is a licensed contractor. With his help and some donated building materials they were able to rebuild a porch for a neighbor instead of just patching it. The team has also started sealing gaps in some CIM houses which birds had decided to build nests in. They have also begun to insulate pipes underneath the houses. “It feels funny to be insulating pipes when it’s 97 degrees out” says Ben “but last winter the pipes froze beneath several of our houses so it needs to get done.” In Indianapolis the first of three Action teams has concluded its work. “We made major progress on our main goal of renovating two duplexes” says Paul Hommes who is managing the work projects. “The first 1436 Montcalm in the Triangle needed repairs to prepare it for a new student household. We’re putting the two units back together to form a single-family house.”  (L-R): Mary (Colorado Springs) Barbara (northern Virginia) Gabi (Indianapolis) Kathleen (northern Virginia) and Lizzy (Shreveport hidden) scraped flaking paint from the siding of a house on Union Street which the People of Praise owns. In reuniting the two halves of the duplex they needed to knock a hole in a load-bearing divider wall to install a door. “You don’t want to make more holes than necessary or run into plumbing or electrical wiring so you have to be careful” Paul explains. “We finally chose a spot only to discover--once we cut through a layer of plaster--a complete useable door frame already in place hidden in the wall.” Paul made ample use of the building skills of Jack Busekrus (Oahu) who came to Indianapolis with his wife Haidy for their second Action trip. “Jack is 77 yet after a full day of demolition even working during breaks he was still smiling and energetic” says Paul. “He was an amazing example.” Haidy didn’t have much construction experience but she says “Paul did a good job of finding things that I could handle such as going on errands cleaning tools and organizing them. I appreciate that as well as the loving care of Walt and Pam Seale who made sure all our needs were met.”  In the backyard of the duplex in which the CIM men live on the South Side were two large clumps of cement in the ground that had once secured fence posts. It took seven young men to get the first one out but the second had to be broken up before it could be removed. (L-R): Peter Kress (northern Virginia) Jonathan Willard (Servant Branch) Matt Rubio (northern Virginia) David Gruber (Indianapolis) John Burke (Rockford) Paul Hommes and Kevin Schmidt a South Side volunteer. The second duplex targeted for renovation is on the South Side where it will eventually house CIM team members. “It’ll be a while before it’s fit for human habitation” says Paul “but we had to take the first stab at it.” The place reeked of urine and dog feces. “We scrubbed just about everything we could see with bleach” said team member Caityln Conlon a 15-year-old sophomore from Muncie. “The whole trip involved a lot of cleaning. I helped shovel enough dirt from inside and outside of one house to fill 50 trash bags. This trip was one of the best things I’ve ever done!” On Saturday June 11 the first team joined local CIM members Triangle residents members of the Indianapolis branch and South Siders for the now traditional neighborhood block party on Karcher Street. This year a prayer meeting followed immediately afterward to celebrate Pentecost which was the following day. Mike Coney head of the local CIM team says at least seven children and teenagers were prayed with to be baptized in the Spirit that evening. Mike Zusi Action program office coordinator notes that there is still room for a few more adults on the later trips this summer.

From left Carlos Castro Stephen Kabele Naomi Shreves and Peter Kabele. (Photo credit: Glenn Rymsza). This fall the Vancouver-Portland branch will open a school in the Kenton area of Portland. The venture named Trinity Academy will begin by offering ninth-grade classes to four children of branch members. ""We are starting out small but we have high hopes for the future” says Vancouver-Portland branch’s principal branch coordinator Charlie Fraga. “We’ve been researching the possibility of a school for years. Finally now seems the time to start."" He adds that the school will fit in well with the branch's other city-building efforts in Kenton. The new school will use a version of the Trinity School curriculum adapted by The Academy Project a company owned and directed by Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) head of school for Trinity School at Meadow View.  Although Trinity Academy in the Vancouver-Portland branch will not be a Trinity School campus at the start branch leaders hope the school will grow toward that goal.  Jo Clark will lead the new Trinity Academy in the fall. Jo Clark a member of the branch with a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Georgetown University will be leaving her position as adjunct professor of chemistry at the University of Portland to become the head of school. The faculty will include various members of the branch each working part-time. Classes will be held in a variety of locations around Kenton explains Eric Shreves whose daughter Naomi will attend the school. “Our hope is that our students will be able to use the basement of the former rectory we own as home base where Jo would teach Humane Letters and walk to Charlie Fraga’s nearby Direct Development office to study Latin with Pat Clark who works there then perhaps meet up with Glenn Rymsza at a portable classroom on the grounds of De La Salle High School located a block away for Scripture or doctrine.” “This decision came after a considerable process of prayer and discernment” says Charlie. ""We received input from branch members from a feasibility study group comprised of some of the branch coordinators and prospective parents and from many people with experience working for Trinity Schools."" “The strength of character of these particular children was a key factor in the decision to move now” adds Jo. “We felt they could handle any difficulties caused by being the inaugural class and would go on to become leaders for newer students.” The inaugural student body consists of four ninth-graders: Carlos Castro Naomi Shreves and twins Peter and Stephen Kabele. After participating in the planning they are all on board with the project. Naomi (15) is excited to get started. “I’m hoping people will see us walking to and from class and recognize our uniforms and know who we are. I’m looking forward to a great education. It also looks like we’ll be able to take part in sports programs at nearby public schools.” Peter Kabele (14) was happy he had a say in how the school was formed and says all his friends “are okay” with the prospect of him attending another school. His brother Stephen is happy he’ll still be eligible to participate in activities such as band or choir at public schools if he chooses to. He even hopes to recruit a few more students before school starts. Carlos Castro (14) says he’ll enjoy walking between classes. Like the others he looks forward to the personal attention he’ll receive because of the school’s small size and appreciates everyone’s efforts to overcome the challenges that come from being so small. “I heard some things about Trinity from friends who live in northern Virginia and they really enjoy it.” “If this experiment works and we do grow larger and strong enough to become a Trinity School campus” Charlie says “it might be a model for how people in other small branches can give their children a Trinity School education. For now please pray that we can discover other students who might be candidates for joining us in this initiative before the school’s opening in September.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1938
1929,June 16 2011 9:02 p.m.,Lloyd Mehaffey to Lead New Orleans Branch,"By Chris Meehan  Mike Coney (left) and Lloyd Mehaffey. (Credit: Linda Coney) Lloyd Mehaffey began serving as the principal branch coordinator for the New Orleans branch on June 15. He follows Mike Coney who has served for two consecutive six-year terms as PBC. Mike continues to serve on the community's board of governors and as the coordinator responsible for the Biloxi Mobile and Shreveport branches. He says he is looking forward to serving the New Orleans branch however he can in the future. “Lloyd is an experienced branch coordinator” says Kevin Ranaghan chair of the branch relations council. “I have always been impressed by his deep understanding of our community life which will be a big help to him and the other brothers and sisters.” Born and raised in New Orleans Lloyd has been a member of the branch since it became part of the People of Praise in 1986. Lloyd and his wife Kathy were also members of the group that preceded it the Community of Jesus the King. During his years at Hendrix College in Conway AR Lloyd started interdenominational prayer meetings on campus and did street witnessing in nearby Little Rock. “I always thought the Lord was ecumenical so why shouldn’t I be the same way?” he asks with a laugh. In the last few months Lloyd Kathy and other branch members have occasionally visited a local park to evangelize and pray with strangers. As vice-president and part owner of Mehaffey & Daigle Inc. he sells industrial raw materials to plastics pharmaceuticals and chemicals companies in five states which requires a day trip every week or two. Lloyd and Kathy have six children ages 15-30 (Dan Kathleen Stacy Emily Shannon and Megan) two still at home. He has a strong baritone voice and for many years Lloyd sang in the branch’s music ministry. “I am extremely happy Lloyd will lead us” says Bill Wiltz (New Orleans). “He’s a one-of-a-kind guy and one of the main reasons I’m in the People of Praise. He’s never too busy to help and was on the phone with me almost every day of the nine months we were out of our home due to Hurricane Katrina.” During Mike Coney’s twelve years as head of the branch Hurricane Katrina was a defining moment says Tom Evans (New Orleans).  “I clearly remember our first branch meeting after Katrina. We had all been dispersed over several states for about six weeks. It was Mike who contacted us all to ‘Come on home’ for a Lord’s Day celebration and community meeting at his home which had escaped flooding. All of us who could make it did and we had a joyous reunion everybody catching up on everybody else’s stories. It was a wonderful moment for us all and Mike presided.” Branch member Phil Slattery notes that Mike has always been a strong leader in the branch. ""And after serving as a coordinator for around 20 years Mike isn’t looking forward to a rest but for one more way to serve.” Kevin says that Mike wears many hats very well: husband father grandfather deacon lawyer and coordinator. “He combines wisdom with a pastoral gift that is life-giving. He has a passion for branch unity that was very evident in the aftermath of Katrina. We’re fortunate that he will continue to serve on the board of governors and with his wife Linda on the branch relations team.” Branch member Elaine Chetta comments that Mike is very generous man using his time and talents for God’s glory. Her husband Nick agrees pointing out the time Mike opened his house up to their family during Hurricane Georges in 1998. “Mike did a great job and I trust Lloyd to do the same” adds Tucky Argus. ""I’m very peaceful grateful and happy in this time of change.""",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1929
1902,June 2 2011 5:24 p.m.,Bikes for Allendale and Beyond,Just over a year ago Jim Ingram (Servant Branch) decided to find a couple of old bikes restore them and send them to Allendale. Now he and other south central area members are turning castoff bikes into reliable rides for children in Louisiana and Minnesota alike. They've restored 19 bikes so far including 10 for Allendale children. About 20 more bikes are in the pipeline.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1902
1891,May 13 2011 2:48 p.m.,Arson Fires on the Indy South Side,By Chris MeehanA fire in Indianapolis has severely damaged an abandoned house next door to a home owned by members of the South Side Christians in Mission team. The fire was part of a wave of 10 fires that struck the city the night of May 9 killing one person in Fountain Square (a neighborhood several miles away from the CIM houses). Authorities confirmed that arsonists set at least seven of the fires.David Zimmel head of the CIM team says that the CIM house was not damaged. “The Lord protected us” David says. “No one was inside the burning house and no one was living in the house we own next door to it. Our nearby properties weren’t harmed.” The 120-year old house had been abandoned years ago. The yard was overgrown and the windows and doors boarded up.  Around 1:00 a.m. Monday morning a neighbor had awakened CIM team members Ray and Robin Gonzalez who live nearby warning them to move their cars. Ray then called Paul Hommes to warn the men’s household.  “If the fire had gone on 10 more minutes or the wind had changed direction we would have had flames licking at our house” Paul says.CIM team members appeared in several TV news reports about the fires. “Fires like this only highlight the need for Christian community on the South Side” David says. “They give us a sense of urgency and a renewed commitment to what we’re doing. With help from our Action volunteers we’ve already renovated seven older homes that would have been good candidates for a fire like this before. We’re eager to continue working hard to build a stronger safer neighborhood.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1891
1852,April 8 2011 3:47 p.m.,A New Director for Servant Camp,By Chris Meehan Pat Ficker a 30-year veteran of Servant Camp will direct the camp for the first time this summer. Pat follows Carmen Lee who served for 26 years as director with his late wife Gail at his side for all but the last of those years. In his role as camp director “Mr. Lee” helped a generation of People of Praise children weather tornadoes homesickness broken bones and capsized canoes. He attended the camp for 32 years running.  Carmen and Gail Lee “Servant Camp is an experience of the kingdom of God among us—friendship with one another and with the Lord” says principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler. “The camp’s impact on so many individuals’ lives is practically immeasurable. It’s one of the best things we do as a branch. Carmen’s 32 years of generous wonderful and heartfelt service have been integral to that experience and for that we thank him.” By Carmen’s estimation he shared responsibility for 7500 campers many of whom returned multiple times as campers or counselors. Children came from 12 other branches. The record for attendance was set in 1997 at 425. “Camp has been such a work of God it is difficult to explain it” says Carmen. “So many have seen God and I think many may have touched him smelled him heard him and much more there. It has been a blessing and a rich experience for me and many.” Sam Mertz (Servant Branch) is one of many current community members with a story to tell about an experience of the Holy Spirit at Servant Camp. Sam was prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit just before tenth grade around a Servant Camp campfire. “It was a powerful experience and I knew life wouldn’t ever be the same.” Andrea DeLee a campus division member living in the Indianapolis Triangle asked to be prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit at Servant Camp just before eighth grade. Raised in the South Bend branch she was amazed to meet so many other girls raised the same way she was. “It was the final prayer meeting and the counselors were spread out in the field behind the campfire and Mr. Lee encouraged us to go out and ask to be prayed with. I was hoping the opportunity would come so I did and I felt the embrace of the Lord and his words ‘Come to me my daughter.’ After that I slowly began to pray daily and eventually experienced spiritual gifts as I participated in Action and moved to the Triangle.”  Pat and Patricia Ficker Pat is already in the middle of planning this summer’s camp and deciding on the theme. “Servant Camp has been part of my life for a long time so it wasn’t hard to imagine what the job would be like” he says. “I believe the Lord told me not to count the cost and that he would take care of me in the process. So I agreed to do it.” Seasoned camp leaders Mike and Jeanne Oberg and Ginny DeSanto will continue to help Pat keep things running smoothly. Pat and his wife Patricia have five children including community members Dan (Servant Branch) Laura (South Bend) Lisa (South Bend) and Catherine (living as a missionary in Evansville) all grown and all—like their father—camp veterans. Servant Camp TriviaCarmen’s miscellaneous memories and milestones for diehard Servant Campers: • The first camp took place in the summer of 1978. It was in the back yard of Al and Deb Saunders and about 15 campers attended. • I starting working with camp in 1978. (I did not attend the first camp but I did participate in the planning). I took over as the director in the spring of 1985. • In 1992 the Holy Spirit came to camp in a new and powerful way with a group of boys that included Mike Wacker Hugh Springer Jr. and Andy Grams (all Servant Branch). • Our hardest year was 1994 when counselor George Simons died due to heart problems during camp. • The camps from 2002 to 2009 were extraordinary. We all expected God to be there in power and he was each year. • We put all of our forms on a website in 2007. Before that I was sending out as many as 20+ pages to some families. • In 2000 a tornado changed direction and moved away from our closing ceremony—it happened right after we prayed. That year we also started a program for first- and second-grade campers. • In 2008 for the first time ever the other camp leaders and I had a building to work out of: a cabin and that was a real blessing. Up to that time we used makeshift tents camping trailers etc. for our meetings. • At our staff party in 2006 I realized that more than half of our staff that year had been campers at one time.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1852
1866,April 8 2011 3:46 p.m.,In Indianapolis A Gathering for Young Men,By Chris MeehanTwenty-three high school-aged young men from seven branches spent March 25-27 on retreat at the People of Praise Center in Indianapolis. The event began as a brainstormed idea in a men’s group meeting in Indianapolis and grew quickly to a multi-branch gathering that attracted young men from as far away as Colorado Springs and northern Virginia.“In January we had our first meeting as a newly set up men’s group composed mostly of students from IUPUI and Purdue” explains George Kane a campus division member living in the Indianapolis Triangle. “We said ‘We’ve got eight guys in our group and around three months in the semester—what do we want to do?’ ‘Get to know our younger brothers in Christ’ turned out to be the answer so we set about figuring out a way to do that.” “We were responding to Craig Lent’s charge to men’s groups to take initiative in evangelism” adds Walt Seale the group’s leader. Craig called on men’s groups to play an active role in community growth at the Leaders' Conference for Men in 2005. Still Walt says “We only expected that a few young men would actually be able to come that distance without more advance notice than we had time to provide. As more signed up and we counted the drivers and staff the total attendance reached 40. Upon hearing about it Dave Porter (Indianapolis) graciously gave us permission to use the branch’s community center.” Walt gave six talks including practical ones such as “Six Steps to Making a Good Decision” and “Eight Elements of True Friendship in Christ.” Other men’s group members told personal stories to illustrate the talks. Adults and college students from the men’s group  joined the young men in small-group discussions. Between sessions the young men played basketball or went on walks. On Saturday night they played a two-hour 20-on-20 game of dodgeball. The conversations continued into the early morning hours. “We talked about life and going to college” says 15-year-old ninth-grader Sam Swanson from Servant Branch. “It was fun to meet so many guys from all over and the talks were pretty helpful. I would recommend this retreat to others if they hold one next year.” “I really liked the talks and got a lot out of them” added Brad Elliott a 14-year-old ninth-grader from northern Virginia. “The physical exercises on Saturday morning were a challenge for us and I enjoyed the upbeat household I got to stay with.” One of the attendees John Burke a 17-year-old senior from Rockford first heard about Action from his next-door neighbor Chris Newburn. John was grateful that Walt spoke about selecting a college in his talk about making decisions. “It will help me think about what I want to do.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1866
1839,March 31 2011 7:35 p.m.,March through the Valley #10: Dinkytown,Download audio version. Nick Holovaty: Praise God! Our last sharing comes from Jen Torma. Jen was one of the first members of the Dinkytown campus division and now she’s the women’s leader there. Jen Torma: I’m going to try to summarize my life in three minutes or less! I spent my childhood in the Muncie branch and have a lot of memories there. Every Monday night my family would have three single brothers and sisters over. That was just a part of the culture of our family. We would celebrate Lord’s Days together with other families and we’d vacation in northern Michigan with Pete and Beth Walters and their family and so I had a really rich childhood. I’m the oldest of five and when I was in eighth grade my family moved to South Bend. I went to Trinity and then went on to study chemistry at Saint Mary's College. It was during college that I decided to join the People of Praise. I tried out college life for about a semester and just realized that I could be a good Christian girl by myself but there had to be more. I saw the more in our life together in the People of Praise so I wanted to join that. So when I was in college the big question for me was “What do I do after college?” I was thinking basically of being a doctor or a nurse. At that time Medicare had put a pretty significant cap on spending for physical therapy so jobs were scarce. My line of thinking was Well I know there will always be doctors and there will always be nurses so I’m going to choose one of those. I’m interested in both. So the summer before my senior year of college I did some research for a foot and ankle surgeon in the Indianapolis branch Dave Porter. One day during that summer I got to shadow Genevieve DeCelles now Genevieve Barrett. She’s a physical therapist and she was working for his clinic. I really loved what I saw her doing so I thought maybe I should put that onto the options list. So I headed into my senior year and I decided to apply to one physical therapy school and one medical school. What I was really hoping for was that I would get into one and not the other so that the decision would be really easy. That’s kind of a reflection of what my relationship with the Lord was like at the time. His good faithful daughter would do anything that he wanted but I wanted him to tell me send neon signs. That’s not what happened. I ended up getting into both schools the same month. As I experienced that I was realizing that the Lord wanted to know how I wanted to build his kingdom. So I went ahead and pursued physical therapy school and I did that in Indianapolis. I lived in the Indianapolis branch during most of that time lived in household with a family there and as I was nearing the end of physical therapy school I was again faced with decision-making time. What did I want to do? At the time Allendale was about two years old and Dinkytown was just getting off the ground. I visited both places and by April of my last semester I had gotten to a point where I really thought I could be happy and useful for the Lord in either spot so both locations had particular draws. So three weeks before I finished physical therapy school I came back from a clinical I was doing in South Bend. I was in Indianapolis and I had gotten to town a little before the rest of my physical therapy class so I was kind of looking at free Friday and Saturday evenings and I really liked to do things with people on those evenings. I particularly loved the Lord’s Day so I thought What am I going to do this evening? So I invited two high-school-age women over and we made pizza together and celebrated the Lord’s Day together. Then as I kept thinking and praying in the days that followed I realized that my heart had been moved to living and working with college-age women. So I called Genevieve up and asked her where to buy a parka! Since moving here to Minnesota my desire to live with college-age women has been blessed a hundredfold. I’ve lived with at least 35 women and weekly I get to celebrate the Lord’s Day with them and hear about what the Lord has been doing during the week. So currently I’m learning about French diction public health pediatric nursing the Google Art Project pottery the WolframAlpha search engine—all these things because of how we share life and what we’re studying in our household in the campus division. I’ve also experienced really being able to be a part of our brothers’ and sisters’ lives who have moved on from Dinkytown. One example of this is recently I was in Allendale for Marie Elise Barrett’s baptism and at one point we were standing around celebrating the day and thanking the Lord for that and as I looked around the room I saw Laura Brummer Colleen Murray and Genevieve Barrett--all sisters I’ve lived with in Dinkytown--and Chris Vieck was there who was a huge help in getting Dinkytown off the ground and Ellen Reed who is a missionary in Evansville now (she taught me calculus at Trinity) so I am just so grateful to the Lord for these relationships and for what he is doing with all of us.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1839
1809,March 29 2011 10:26 p.m.,March through the Valley #9: Video Communications,Download audio version. Elizabeth Grams: I grew up here in Servant Branch and went to Trinity School. I came underway in the Colorado Springs branch and have belonged to the South Bend branch for almost 10 years now. I'm also a member of the Sisterhood. You may have noticed my name on the videos the community has been putting out and I’d like to tell you a little bit about that: how I came to do that and what my work with the People of Praise looks like. In college I studied music and theater. After college I decided to set them aside so that I could live in a campus division household and make myself available to serve the community in any way I could. I spent my evenings writing for Vine & Branches and learning some basic computer programming—this was an effort to help the budding One:Ten Communications division of the LaSalle Company. (I'd say it was more of “an effort” than “help.”) When Sean Connolly asked me to start working for the People of Praise Communications Office not only in writing but primarily in video production I had zero experience with video. I started out in 2007 making filming trips to the South Side of Indianapolis where our missionaries were then beginning to hold prayer meetings and lay the foundations for Christian community. Kevin Daly who spent several summers of his college career serving in our communications efforts taught me how to use our video cameras and edit video footage. We used a computer built and donated to us by Ken Larsen and got a lot of equipment advice from Tom Bowar. I work on the Greenlawn property where Trinity School at Greenlawn the People of Praise executive offices and the People of Praise growth center are all located. My studio is in Raclin Hall the growth center building. The building also houses offices of the other communications team members the property development team and the Center for Christian Studies. I often get to hear updates at our office morning prayer on the latest Action trip or new properties the community has purchased or renovated. I get to participate in meetings of the growth team led by Paul DeCelles who is responsible for all the program offices. I’m always hearing about new things the Lord is doing among our missionaries and in all our branches from Chris Meehan who does reporting for the communications team. I continue to rely on other brothers and sisters as I do the work I do. Any time we make changes to the People of Praise web site or post videos in a new location the folks in One:Ten Communications help us make it happen. In addition Tom Noe Dan DeCelles and others associated with the Center for Christian Studies save us from many slips of the tongue. Recently we were able to borrow some lighting equipment from the drama department at Trinity for a large video shoot. The property management team over at Greenlawn helped us make a living room into a studio. In fact Paul Hommes and Nick Raway both in Christians in Mission in Indianapolis came to South Bend recently to donate a few days of their time to renovate a larger filming space for us. Susan Holovaty and Gloria Murphy have done hours of service for the communications team over the last year in transcribing video interviews. Joe Gleason who volunteered a lot of his time as a college student to our video production is now working in our department. I could go on and on about brothers and sisters whose names may not be in the credits of our videos but who are truly making it possible for us to communicate as we do. One day a few months ago I found myself in a very tight spot when our video camera’s behavior made an apparent change. We were scheduled to film a talk that day and it was going to be our only chance to get it on camera but our test footage was looking really funny. Nothing we tried could fix the problem. I started making phone calls to anyone in South Bend I could think of. One man Jack called me back immediately and gave me a few suggestions offering more assistance if I should need it. I did what he said and it worked! He saved the day. I was so grateful to him that I later went to his business to thank him personally. He furrowed his brow paused and said “It’s like that Gospel story--the one who came back.” “You mean the ten lepers?” He smiled. “Yes you’re the one who came back to say thank you.” Thank you brothers and sisters and thank you Lord for making it possible for us to labor with you in the Mississippi Valley!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1809
1820,March 29 2011 10:24 p.m.,March through the Valley #8: South Bend,Download audio version. Gretchen Connolly:I grew up here in Servant Branch and went to Trinity School back when it was at Gethsemane Episcopal Church in Minneapolis. I came underway when I was in college and moved to South Bend in 1999 where I taught at Trinity School at Greenlawn for five years. Then I moved down to Shreveport and helped with mission work in Allendale for three years. Sean had already been in Shreveport for a year so we overlapped for a couple of years. After those three years I moved back to South Bend to work for the People of Praise in communications and that’s when Sean and I started dating. We were married in 2009. Sean Connolly:And we have a little girl named Gloria and one on the way a boy. You might have noticed at Justin and Cathy Walters’s wedding yesterday that he and I have something in common. We’re both corn-fed Indiana boys who married Minnesota girls! I want to tell you a story about how the Lord has taken care of Gretchen and me. While we were living in Allendale we were both in households that were financially in common. We were putting a lot of our extra money toward the mission work we were doing so when we got married we didn’t have a lot of extra change. Our plan was to live on the campus of Trinity School at Greenlawn in an apartment that’s known as the “launching pad” because a lot of young married couples have lived there for year or two just after getting married. We were all set to do that too but a month before our wedding a house came up for sale on Greenlawn Avenue right across the street from the community’s property. Gretchen and I were very interested in it because quite a few young singles and some married couples--many of whom work for the community--live either on the property or in houses nearby so we knew it would be awesome if we could land there. We looked at the house and loved it and we made an offer which I admit was pretty low. The couple who were selling the house looked us in the eye and said “No thanks.” So we let it go. We got married and went on our honeymoon. A couple of weeks after that the gentleman who was selling the house called me out of the blue and said “Another person wants to make an offer on the house but we like you and if you want to pay us some more money we would be glad to sell the house to you.” We knew that if we were going to do it we had to work fast so I talked to Gretchen and I talked to my head Paul DeCelles who works in the same building as I do--which is convenient. Remember I said we didn’t have much money before we got married but when we got married brothers and sisters gave us money. In fact we had a lot more money than I thought we were ever going to have. So basically in the course of a week we decided that yes we could really do this. Long story short we got the house and it has been a blessing to us. Cathy got to live with us in household for the three months before her wedding and Justin and Cathy are moving into a house whose back yard is literally right behind us. That house is owned by the Sisterhood and they’re renting it to them and we’re just tickled about that. We’re just so grateful to all our brothers and sisters in the Lord for taking care of us.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1820
1792,March 24 2011 4:30 p.m.,March through the Valley #7: Indianapolis Triangle,Download audio version. Nick Holovaty:The missionaries have come a long way since the days when it was just Rus Jon and I living in Indianapolis. Among others who joined us in Indianapolis Trish Brewer moved down from South Bend and she’s now the women’s leader in what we call the Triangle. Trish Brewer:My parents Dan and Anne Brewer are in the South Bend branch and many people here in Servant Branch know my sister Carolyn who is married to Bill Reinhardt (New Orleans). I went to Trinity School at Greenlawn and then joined the South Bend campus division while attending Saint Mary’s College. After graduating I worked for Vine & Branches and then helped with administration for the campus division in South Bend. In the fall of 2008 I moved to the Triangle in Indianapolis to help continue building the People of Praise campus outreach at IUPUI. Last summer I headed the women on the Action trips in Indy. This year I’m leading the campus women’s household. In our household of 10 we have four women from Servant branch: Cathy Schwab Annie Putzier Amy Rice and Rachel Osterhouse. Walt Seale is leading the men’s household which has six men on one side of a duplex and Walt and Pam are living on the other side. He heads up our two households combined which we call the Triangle Campus Team. Our women’s household has been blessed this semester to be living for the first time at 1450 Rembrandt the house formerly known as 1435 Montcalm. The house was picked up and moved down the street and around the block this past summer. We have many of you to thank for renovating the house during Action trips the past three summers.  Our back yard would still be a trash heap if it wasn’t for Don Ferber and all the dump trips he made. As a campus team we are learning what God is calling each of us to learn maturing in our life in the People of Praise growing in brotherhood and sisterhood and putting our studies in common. One story that I want to share with you is about Annie Putzier. She decided to walk home after one of her classes. It was a sunny day and it was about a 25-minute walk. On her way back she heard the Holy Spirit tell her to turn around and talk to the girl walking behind her. So she did and that’s how we met Lynn. Annie told her about what we were doing in the Triangle and Lynn was thrilled to hear about Christian community life nearby. They exchanged contact information and the next Lord’s Day Lynn came. As she walked in we were singing and worshipping together and she right away started singing and her face was beaming and it was like she was home. When we went around thanking the Lord for things she shared that she was thankful to the Lord for getting to meet Annie and being able to join us in praising God. She has continued to come over for dinner and to grow in friendship with our women’s household. We’re looking forward to seeing how the Lord will continue to grow and deepen the roots of the People of Praise life in the Triangle.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1792
1781,March 22 2011 2:52 p.m.,March through the Valley #6: IUPUI,Download audio version. Nick Holovaty: Now we’re going to share about the area of Indianapolis where the campus of Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) is located. Four years ago Ryan Hardin had never heard of the People of Praise. He was a senior at IUPUI looking forward to graduating and probably going to dental school. Now he’s a veteran member of the Missionary Company. Ryan Hardin: I grew up in Indianapolis and as Nick said went to IUPUI. One time when I was sitting on campus minding my own business and eating my lunch with a friend this kind of tall skinny guy with messed-up hair walks up to me and my friend and starts telling us about what the Lord’s doing with him and Rus Lyons and Nick. It was Jon Gapp. The problem was I wasn’t very anxious to hear anything from Jon. I was a Christian at this point and actually I had been praying for a group of guys to get in with who were really following the Lord but I didn’t make the connection with Jon. I told him that what he really needed to do was to go out and get a job! Well 10 months later in October of 2007 I was sitting on campus minding my own business and Abe Olson walked up. I reacted to him in the same way. I wasn’t interested in hearing about what the Lord was doing with these poor missionaries who were depending on him for what they got for everything they needed. But a friend of mine walked up and began saying things like “Well what’s wrong with that? What’s wrong with what they’re doing and with being poor with the Lord?” That kind of got to me and so a month later I got back in touch with Abe—which was a miracle. We got together had some lunch did some things together. I came over and did some meditations ate dinner and eventually came underway in the People of Praise after my graduation. I moved into the Triangle with JT Kelly Ray and Robin Gonzalez Trish Brewer and Naomi Caneff. That was great. I had a job for a while and then I started praying about it more and more. I made the Spiritual Exercises and coming out of that I decided that the Lord wanted me to be a poor missionary. So now I’m a missionary with the People of Praise in Evansville and praising the Lord for it every day.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1781

Nick Holovaty: Now we’re going to the south side of Indianapolis where Naomi Caneff is the women’s leader. Naomi Caneff: Hi Everybody. I grew up here in Servant Branch then went to Portland to go to college. After I graduated from nursing school I moved to Indianapolis to be part of the Missionary Company. I’ve lived there now for the last three years doing mission work of different kinds and I made the covenant last October. I am now part of the Christians in Mission team living on the South Side. I want to tell you about a woman who has become a part of my life there Rebecca. I’ll start by telling you a story that I heard about her before meeting her. The missionaries were cleaning a house we recently purchased and had invited some neighbors to come and help. Rebecca wanted to join in but we didn’t have anybody to pick her up so she walked over four miles in about an hour and a half. I heard this story and was just amazed. Later we were cleaning another house and she again wanted to help but we weren’t able to give her a ride so she rode her eleven-year-old daughter’s bike to the house. She really wanted to join in our work with us. She was standing in front of a wall to clean and her hands were pruny with vinegar water. She started washing the wall with a rag and saying “I can’t believe I get to do God’s work with you guys.” There are more stories about Rebecca that I have heard and now I’m able to witness them myself. She is in a women’s group with us now and goes to prayer meetings every Sunday. She gives words from the Lord and enters joyfully into praise with us. She is just full of love for him even though her life has not been an easy road. She often tells us “You guys are my family.” A few years ago Rebecca made some significant changes in her life and said that now all she wants is to “keep following God and doing what he’s doing in the world.” She is also a faithful friend to God in prayer. We often get texts from her on our phone or voice mails sharing what she read that day in prayer. “Good morning! Read Isaiah 60.” Rebecca is consistently looking for ways to share more life with us. She once told me that she had been praying and God told her to “come under the People of Praise.” “I want to live my life with you guys” she says. In recent news we have been in conversation with Rebecca about her and her daughter possibly living on Karcher Street which is essentially next door. As Rebecca often tells me “God is wonderful.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1772
1764,March 15 2011 4:34 p.m.,March through the Valley #4: On the Road,Download audio version. Peter Putzier: I grew up here in Servant Branch and went to the University of Minnesota for a couple of years. Now I’m taking some time off and doing mission work--for the past year and a half plus. This story is about a hitchhiking trip. Around September Peter Coleman Rus Lyons and I were in Dale Indiana. It has been a pretty long day of mission work and we get to the end of the day about 6 o’clock and we’re still looking for a place to stay. So we sit down on a curb underneath the water tower. It’s getting dark so we decide that we need to start knocking on doors and finding a place to stay. So we’re walking across the street and there’s this guy at the second house we walk by. It’s a small house with kind of a carport connected to the house. We see this guy in the back yard and he’s working on a deck or something and so we figure let’s go talk to this guy. We walk up and say “We’re Christian missionaries and we’d like to beg some food and shelter from you.” He’s in his 30s a pretty burly guy and he looks surprised but he doesn’t miss a beat. He goes inside and talks to his wife and they come out and say “I don’t know if we can put you up. We got some kids here and we’re kind of full but if you want to stay we’ll cook you some dinner.” And we say “That would be great. We’d love that.” So while his wife—Julie we’ll call her—is making dinner we go out in the back and it turns out this guy Matt is working on his deck in his back yard that’s he’s putting a hot tub on. So we feel like this is exactly what we want to do after a day walking around talking to folks. Give us a hammer you know that’s great! It takes a little convincing before he actually believes that this is what we want to do. So we spend awhile working on the deck and then we go inside for pancakes and cookies and bananas. While we’re eating Julie and Matt are conferencing and when we’re done eating they say “We were thinking about it and we’d like to offer you a place to stay.” And Julie says “I just . . . we got kids and I want to make sure that you’re not psycho-killers. Do you have someone we can call so we know that you are who you say you are?” So we give them Nick Holovaty’s number and Matt calls Nick and they decide we’re okay. So after dinner we went out in the back and helped Matt. When we got there he had holes in the ground. That’s all he had for this deck he was building and we showed up and we got the whole thing framed out by about midnight that night. Then we went inside because we had wanted to talk to them both about the Holy Spirit and also we wanted to pray for Julie because she told us she has heart arrhythmia. So we ended up meeting about midnight in the front room of their house and we prayed for Julie for this heart arrhythmia. And as we’re praying she says “I am getting lightheaded. I need to sit down.” So she sits down. We kind of leave it at that. We don’t know if anything actually happened and we explain to them about the Holy Spirit and tell them some stories and Matt hasn’t been prayed with for the baptism of the Holy Spirit and Julie has. And Matt totally wants the Holy Spirit so we all pray for him and after that Julie says “You know my heart . . . it’s beating steady right now.” We say “Well praise God. That’s a healing you know. The Lord healed your heart of the arrhythmia.”  And her heart is still better. We went back several months later and she doesn’t have problems with it. Glory to God. Thank you Lord. The next morning we get up and talk to Matt and at Julie’s prompting he says “You know I got to tell you guys the other day I asked the Lord three times for a blessing and it was the first time I had ever asked God to send me a blessing. Things had been going really rough and I prayed to the Lord three times ‘Lord send me a blessing send me a blessing send me a blessing.’ And at the end of the day you guys showed up. I had been trying to get my friends to help me with this deck but it was like pulling teeth . . . and now we’re halfway done. . . so thank you Lord.” Nick Holovaty: Thanks Peter. By the way the deck is now done . . . and I got to meet Matt. He said “You know I was the guy who called you Nick. I just wasn’t the type of guy to have strangers over and stay in my house.” Then he told us a story about how he was driving late on Christmas Eve and he saw a car spin out in front of him on the snow. He said “You know I’m not proud of it but before I would have just passed by but I stopped and helped her and she was okay.” So he stayed and two other men stopped and pulled the car out of the ditch and he helped this girl and he said “I’ve been changing since you guys showed up. Things are changing around here.” Praise God.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1764
1760,March 11 2011 3:31 p.m.,Oahu Branch Members Are Safe After Tsunami,"Tom Duddy says that branch members are safe after a tsunami began hitting the Hawaiian islands around 3:00 a.m. local time on Friday morning. An 8.9 magnitude earthquake near the Japanese coast triggered the waves with hundreds of deaths already reported in northern Japan. In Oahu the damage appears to be minimal and confined to harbor areas with no reported deaths or injuries as of early Friday morning. Bob and Bev Linczer (Oahu) evacuated their home near Oahu's south shore but found no damage when they returned to the house on Friday morning. Many businesses and schools across the islands are closed on Friday including the Waikiki-area store where Bob Badham (Oahu) has been working. ""The storm is affecting everyone"" Bob says. ""Nearly everything is shut down including bus service and all unessential services at the Honolulu airport."" Honolulu's mayor issued an all-clear signal shortly after daybreak on Friday morning. Tom says the branch women's retreat scheduled to begin on Friday evening will go on as planned. Nano Farabaugh (South Bend) is giving this year's retreat to be held on high ground at St. Anthony Retreat Center. During last year's retreat tsunami sirens sounded early on Saturday morning and some nearby residents came to the retreat center seeking cover. That storm was less damaging. ""But it was a distraction to the retreat"" Mary Duddy says. ""Last night at dinner we were telling Nano and Chris Vieck (South Bend) stories about the retreat last year"" adds Tom. ""We didn't know then that this tsunami was going to happen. “We appreciate your prayers for the retreat and we’re praying for the people in Japan” he says.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1760
1746,March 10 2011 2:59 p.m.,March through the Valley #3: Hitchhiking,Download audio version. Nick Holovaty:This past summer Rus Lyons started taking missionary brothers out on evangelistic hitchhiking trips three-day trips. They would walk out of Evansville on a Thursday morning with a sign that said “Terre Haute” or some other town and they would come back in time to open the Lord’s Day on Saturday evening. That meant there were certain restraints on the distance they could travel in that amount of time. They’ve made seven trips since July. Rus will give the first sharing about them. Rus Lyons: The People of Praise moved in next door to my fraternity house when I was going to the University of Minnesota and that’s how I got connected with the community. I’ve been doing mission work in Indianapolis and Evansville since 2007. It was overcast when we got dropped off in Rockport Indiana. Peter Coleman Joe Bulger and I decided to share words we’d received. We had just finished a prayer time which is what we do before we go out to do some mission work. We don’t really have a script because we rely on the Lord to give us what to say. Joe had a word to talk about the Holy Spirit and a word to “speak simply. The people you are going to go to today are already prepared.” So with that we hit the streets and were led to one house and to another house farther away and then to another house farther in. But no one was answering the door until we get to a house where a young woman comes out--Eve--and we say “The Lord sent us here to Rockport to talk about the Holy Spirit.” She says “Well we’re Pentecostal.” So we said “You all probably know about the Holy Spirit” and her husband Adam comes up and says “Yeah we got baptized in the Spirit last weekend. Do you want to come in?” He invites us in and we sit down. He’s in his early 30s thin and a pretty mellow guy. Eve is a little shorter than he is with long brown hair. They were both looking for work right then. So we often have these ten-minute personal prayer times where we each ask the Lord “What do you want to do Lord?” Then we wait. So we did that and then after that Adam says “You know while I was praying there’s this speech that I have to give and it keeps coming to mind and the Lord said ‘Give glory to me.’ I have to give a speech tonight before some prosecutors and judges about the faith-based rehab program which my wife and I were saved in. We gave our lives to God and got free of drugs and these prosecutors and judges are wondering: Do these things work? Are these programs doing any good?” We talked a little bit about that and he invited us to stay for the night so we went out to do some more mission work and we left him to work on his talk. And while we were walking around Rockport nobody else wanted to hear about God. Nobody else. We arrived back a little bit before dinner. We were actually going to have a free dinner! It was awesome. That night Adam gets up there in front of all these judges and prosecutors and organizers and says “There is one reason I am standing here before you clean. The Lord Jesus Christ.” And he just took that meeting for God. He glorified the Lord. The next day he dropped us off on our way to Tell City and said “My wife and I were talking and we have never had a prayer time like that before. We want to do that every day and you have always got a place to stay in Rockport. Please come back.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1746
1734,March 8 2011 5:05 p.m.,March through the Valley #2 Evansville,Download audio version. By Catherine Ficker I grew up here in Servant Branch and went to Trinity School. After I joined the campus division I lived in Dinkytown for two years and then took two years off of school to do missionary work. I’m finishing up those two years in May. This past year I joined the Sisterhood of the People of Praise so I’ll be moving to South Bend in May and be finishing up school there. Last March Claire Mysliwiec Joe Bulger and I were out walking in a middle-class neighborhood in Evansville. We were almost past this one house when Claire said she was moved to knock there. So we went back and on the patio was a pair of little girl's jeans that were covered in mud and were drying out there. I felt like I really wanted to meet that little girl. So we knocked and we were greeted by a really fast-moving little girl. She saw us then dashed off to go find her mom Cindy. When Cindy came to the door she looked really disheveled. Joe led off with a word we had received which was “God wants you to change your ways!” Cindy looked intently at us and said “Do you want to come in?” So we followed Cindy into her living room. Throughout the house there were many piles of clothes on the floor. The walls seemed recently painted but there were a lot of holes in the walls and a lot of crayon marks on the walls. She led us into the living room and turned off the TV turned off the laptop and she asked the kids to hold the dog so that there were no distractions in the conversation. She sat down and she said “I want to listen to you whatever you have to say.” So we shared some words that we had received from that day’s prayer before we went out. After listening to us she said “So do you all know anything about lawsuits?” Cindy is married and has three small kids and the family had suffered some really hard things and she had recently pulled the kids out of school. She shared a few more details and it became clear that the family was in a time of crisis and Cindy was at the end of her rope. The very next day she was headed for Indianapolis for a hearing. At this point Claire had a word for Cindy from Isaiah 41 and she shared it with her. She said “Fear not for I am with you. Be not dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen you. I will help you and I will uphold you by my righteous right hand.” Cindy responded to this by saying that she had been battling with a lot of fear. She said that she was afraid to call herself a Christian because she didn’t want to mess up and damage God’s reputation. So we told her that she didn’t need to fear that and we offered to pray with her against fear. We told her that God doesn’t wait for us to be perfect to follow him and she was really relieved to hear that. Then we began to talk about the Holy Spirit and we explained about the boldness the Apostles received after being filled with the Spirit. She was excited when we offered to pray with her and she said yes. So we prayed with her for the Holy Spirit and we prayed against fear and after we were done her face lit up and she said “This is really exciting.” We were moved to sing a song with her so we sang “Our God Is an Awesome God.” Then she said “I just want to give all the glory to God.” She shared that on the top of her to-do list for that day was to pray and she said “I hadn’t gotten around to it” so she was amazed that God sent us to her door. She asked “Do you go to every house?” We said “No we wanted to come to yours.” So after about an hour and a half of conversation with Cindy we needed to head home and meet up with the Mission team before dinner so Claire Joe and I walked home singing through the streets of Evansville “I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh.” A few months later after visiting Cindy and her family very often it was really difficult to walk by without some kids running out at us and saying “People of Praise is here!” Maybe there would be only two of us but it was like “It’s the People of Praise.” So that’s fun . . . thinking of you all being there. Her two girls learned really quickly to sing “Love the Lord Your God” and “This Little Light of Mine.” We were singing it a lot. This past month we visited Cindy again. Her house was really in order and the kids are in school now and they’re doing really well. Praise the Lord!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1734
1713,March 3 2011 7:30 p.m.,March through the Valley #1: Allendale,Download audio version. By Patti Deakin Gerry and I have lived in Allendale for three years. One of the first neighbors we met was Miss Eula.  She is 82 years old lives alone and doesn’t get a lot of visitors. At first she was reclusive and full of fear and a lot of times she wouldn’t even open the door to us. We would knock and say “We’re the People of Praise” and there would be no response. After a while we would go away. She believed people were breaking into her house. She didn’t want to leave because if she left they would break in. She had three deadbolts on her front door. She called the police so many times about the break-ins that they recognized her and stopped responding. She walks with a cane and has a very bad knee. If there ever was a fire in her house she wouldn’t be able to get out in time. After we met Miss Eula I began calling her to ask if she needed anything from the grocery store since I was going to go anyway. She kept saying “No. Thank you very much.” After four or five months of asking her she began to let me get her a few items. Then I began asking if she wanted to ride along with me and pick out her own items at the store. She turned me down repeatedly. Change was very gradual and I kept visiting. One day she talked about her fears of break-ins and about the lack of help from the police. I can’t imagine being a person who lives in fear all day long every day—how that would wear on you. On my next visit after praying about what she had shared with me I talked to her about what we might be able to do to fix the problem. If the police weren’t going to help her maybe there was something we could do to make a difference in her life. I told her your house looks abandoned from the outside so people probably think that no one lives there. How about if we put in a dusk-to-dawn sensor light on your carport so that if anyone is coming in from that side you would be able to see them? Maybe we could put a light bulb in the front porch light. Maybe we could remove the debris and the brick pile from in front of the front door so the door could be seen from the street. Maybe we could paint the porch furniture so it would look like people were caring for the house. I told her that there were brothers and sisters living on Yale who would like to help her. After thinking about it for a couple of weeks she agreed to the plan. It was a team effort. I went to Lowe’s and got prices on spray paint for the porch furniture along with a list of the colors that were available in satin and gloss. I showed her the list. She chose the color and I bought the paint. Laura Brummer installed the sensor light in her carport—it was a leftover light from an Action project. Some Action team members sanded the metal chairs on her porch and Gerry spray-painted them. They’re bright red. I really think they shine in the dark and the house looks lived in. She still speaks of her fear occasionally but it is no longer debilitating for her. I continue to take her shopping. I take her to the bank and we run errands together. Sometimes we even see her sitting on the porch with her neighbors in her newly painted chairs. God is giving her a new life.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1713
1679,March 1 2011 10:31 p.m.,March through the Valley: Series Intro,Download audio version. By Nick Holovaty Brothers and sisters Greetings from Evansville! When the apostles Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch after their first missionary trip the Bible says they gathered the community together and told them all that God had done through them. Can you imagine what that meeting must have been like? Paul and Barnabas came in and there was a lot of excitement in the room to hear what God had done. That same excitement was in the room at the Servant Branch community meeting on February 6. Several hundred people had come from many different branches to celebrate Justin Walters’s and Cathy Grill’s wedding the day before. The Servant Branch coordinators asked the missionaries to tell some stories from the front lines and that’s what we did at the meeting. We told stories about what the Lord is doing through us through the whole community in the Mississippi Valley. That meeting was like coming back to Antioch. It was a great meeting and we wish everyone in the community could have been there. So working with the People of Praise communications office we want to send you those stories one at a time over the month of March. The stories will come to you every Tuesday and Thursday beginning this Thursday March 3. We’re calling it “March through the Valley.” There are three things I want to ask you to listen for in these stories. First listen for what’s new. The Lord has been doing something new in the Mississippi Valley over the past 10 years. He’s sending us out in new ways: door-knocking evangelism missionary hitchhiking trips empty-nesters moving to the ghetto. There’s something new going on. Can you see it? Second listen for what’s old because it’s still us—it’s still the People of Praise. In the People of Praise we’ve been helping our neighbors for 40 years. We’ve been going to college together for just as long. We’ve been moving across the country to join the Lord’s work since the very beginning. Those things aren’t new. It’s good that the Lord is doing both new and old things with us. It reminds me of the parable where Jesus says that every scribe in the kingdom will be like the householder who brings forth from his treasure both new and old (Mt. 13:52). That’s us. The third thing I’m asking you to listen for is the connections. More and more the Lord is linking us together across the distances and branches within the People of Praise. He’s uniting us in some surprisingly concrete and nitty-gritty ways. I want to tell you a story to illustrate what I’m talking about. We have a friend on the South Side of Indianapolis that I’ll call Jane. She’s been around us there for several years and she knows us. She’s been in our houses. She’s come to our prayer meetings. We’ve prayed for her to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. About a year ago Jane came up to David Zimmel the mission coordinator on the South Side. “I’ve figured it out” she said. “What’d you figure out?” asked David. “I figured out how you missionaries can live together and get everything done that you get done.” “How?” Jane said her eyebrows raised “Trinity. You guys all went to the same high school.” I don’t know how she figured that out but she may have the gift of prophecy because she’s right. Trinity is a huge factor in all our growth work. It’s a really important connection for us. So listen to what’s new listen for what’s old and listen for the connections. On behalf of the missionaries and all of us in growth work thanks for your prayers and support. We already take y’all with us in our hearts as we go out and we’re really excited to take y’all with us as we march through the Mississippi Valley. God bless.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1679
1515,Feb. 16 2011 1:10 p.m.,In Buffalo A Moment for Ecumenism,The Buffalo branch music ministry by Chris Meehan The Buffalo branch hosted a gathering in which Catholics Mennonites and nondenominational charismatics joined together for prayer and a Lord’s Day meal on February 5th. Eighty-one people braved the snow to share in the potluck supper and prayer meeting held at Harris Hill Mennonite Church the place where the Buffalo branch has held its meetings for more than 20 years. The event emerged out of a scheduling conflict says Tom Shriver Buffalo’s principal branch coordinator. “Mennonite leaders from across New York wanted to use the church for the Saturday evening session of their annual conference but we had already scheduled a Lord’s Day meal there. When they heard that they asked if they could join us. We were happy to agree.” The event expanded again when one of the Mennonite leaders Pastor Gene Miller asked if he could invite leaders from Northgate a local charismatic congregation. “It was a movement of the Spirit that the three groups could get together” Pastor Miller said. “The worship was wonderful and the fellowship excellent. I believe that God was honored and pleased that his children could come together in this way.” Tom added “What would have been a typical event became a historic event for our branch. The three groups gave witness to our common desire to give glory and praise to our Father and to work to build his kingdom.” As host and emcee Tom began the evening by explaining the Lord’s Day opening ceremony which he and his wife Theresa led. Later he also led the prayer meeting with the support of the branch’s music ministry. The Mennonite conference which had been going on since the previous day then resumed with a talk by Pastor Jeff Wright an urban mission strategist from California. His talk “What do we do when the Holy Spirit shows up?” was open to members of all three groups. “Obviously there’s a presence of the Holy Spirit in this building because the People of Praise has been meeting here for more than 20 years” Pastor Wright said. Branch members spoke about their enthusiasm for the event. Jim Hippert said he experienced “an incredible outpouring of the Spirit during the worship time. The energy level was high—up to the level you’d find in the crowd at a professional football game!” “Certainly all the conversations throughout the Lord’s Day meal were so positive” said Arlene Meyerhofer. “We had lots of opportunities to explain who we are and what we do as a community.” She said members of all three groups worked side by side to clean up after the event. Bud Northway can’t remember such a close interaction between Mennonites and members of the community since some community members in South Bend prayed over Nelson Litwiller a retired Mennonite bishop to be baptized in the Holy Spirit in the early 1970s. Bishop Litwiller went on to spread the baptism in the Holy Spirit and charismatic gifts to many Mennonites in South America and elsewhere around the world. “This celebration in Buffalo reminds us of the good relationships the community has had with Mennonites” says Kevin Ranaghan chair of the community's branch relations council and a veteran of many ecumenical gatherings. “The Mennonite renewal was the first Protestant group to sign up for the Kansas City Conference (1977) and we have continued to relate from time to time over the years. This was a great opportunity to deepen our fellowship.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1515
1530,Feb. 16 2011 11:20 a.m.,Katy McShane,Katy McShane Katy McShane (South Bend) died October 9 2010 at age 51 from pancreatic cancer just a few months after the cancer was diagnosed. No one could possibly list all the projects and activities she was involved in or the hundreds of people she knew or the hundreds of lives she touched. In tribute to her we are publishing excerpts from her husband Kevin’s sharing from the evening wake service held in the branch center along with excerpts from a sharing delivered by Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools at her funeral mass the next morning on October 15. Katy Moo was born in South Bend May 20 1959 and joined the People of Praise March 1 1976 when she was 16. In those days high-school students weren’t invited to come underway but Katy was so determined to join the community that we made an exception. She made the covenant September 30 1979. She and Kevin were married June 21 1986 and their union was blessed with four children: James Kevin Sarah and Mary Kate. James and Kevin are members of the South Bend branch and Mary Kate is in Action. Katy taught math and science at Trinity School for many years. Kevin:This evening I am blessed to have this chance to honor my wonderful wife who was my helpmate and the love of my life. Katy was self-sacrificing in everything that she did. This was true in so many areas of life that it resulted in our perennial conversation about her being over-committed. Many times Katy would convince me that with all the needs out there it really made sense for her to continue doing almost everything that she was doing. It was hard to argue with her on this point since it was true that she had all the gifts that she needed to do the task—or rather the tasks. We did as much as we could together. When our kids were young raising them was our common work. But as they got older it became clear that our lives could become simply a parallel existence if we didn’t make specific decisions that would allow us to work together as husband and wife. That thought became the foundation for how we approached Katy’s involvements. Katy had a keen sense of priority with building the kingdom of God being the highest priority. Katy was very hospitable. She loved our family meals Lord’s Day celebrations and holiday traditions. We tried to have people over for dinner often. She wasn’t daunted by the hole in the kitchen ceiling which was open for over a year. I referred to it as our “future skylight” which she thought was moderately humorous. She loved the outdoors. We took our family to nearby state parks and went on hikes together followed by a picnic. We also went camping as a family. Katy has left us a legacy in our children whom she helped to form into the strong loving young men and women that they are. When I think of how much I miss Katy I turn to these four young people who meant so much to her. All have grown in maturity and they love the Lord in their own way. They each have close friends that they care for and enjoy much the same way Katy did through her life. Each has Katy’s love of learning as well. This last year has been quite unusual. The February before last Katy broke her ankle slipping on the ice. This became quite a trial for her. To get up the stairs in the house she would have to sit down and push herself up each step. Katy found a gym that had workouts early in the morning and she signed up for the introductory boot camp. A month later I joined her there. We quickly became much more in shape and healthy. We felt in some ways like we had cheated death and thought that we might even live longer as a result. This summer when Katy received the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer we shifted to thinking of the immediate term. We talked about how instead of training for old age she was training for the fight of her life because the treatments available for this type of cancer are not as effective as for others. We made plans to have life be as normal as possible through the course of the treatments. This seemed to be a comfort to Katy since her life revolved around family school and the community. In the hospital she showed her love of her work at Trinity and her family and friends. (When the medicine and weakness would make her confused she would often start teaching chemistry or calculus to those in the room!) She would rally her strength for those times she had with her children and her close friends and would listen intently to their words. This required great effort in her weakened condition. She was also concerned about the comfort of those who were in the room even when her own suffering was apparent. She would look some in the eye and declare her love for them. Many times she would flash her patented smile which gave us all much joy. God blessed each moment that we had with her and for that we are grateful and we praise God. I loved Katy though imperfectly but now she can enjoy the perfect love of her Father God Jesus her Savior and the Holy Spirit who guided her along the way. Kerry Koller:Many of us here today know Katy from the life we shared with her day in and day out as students parents faculty and staff at Trinity School and that’s the perspective from which I want to honor her. Katy began teaching at Trinity in 1984 fresh out of graduate school at Arizona State University where she had just earned an M.A. in mathematics. In her Trinity School job application of 1984 she wrote: “It has been my goal to become a mathematics teacher for the last twelve years. . . . it is helping others to learn being a facilitator of the learning process that has drawn me towards teaching.” We were really happy that she joined us at Greenlawn but even happier as we saw what a devoted and skilled teacher she was. When she left full-time work at Trinity in 1989 on the occasion of Kevin’s birth I wrote her: “We will miss having you at Trinity. . . . You have done a remarkable job teaching. . . . as far as I can recall everything you have put your hand to has been a success.” From that point on we just kept our eye on the day when she would be able to rejoin us. In fact we never let an occasion go by when we didn’t remind her of this throughout her 14-year maternity leave. We were thrilled when she returned to Trinity in 2003. I’ve been involved with Trinity since the beginning and have taught at each of our campuses. In my entire experience over all these years there is no more dynamic and iconic instance of the notion of the community of learners than what I saw every day in the faculty room at Greenlawn happening among Tom Finke Pat Malone and Katy McShane. Katy and Pat’s desks were next to each other and Tom’s office was right behind them. Every day the three of them worked together on their laptops on mathematics MatLab or science. They would ask one another questions show one another a problem one of them had just solved or ask for help in teaching this or that concept. This conversation went on virtually every day and they were engaged in it most of the time they weren’t in class. It was quite remarkable. When I began this sharing I read some of what Katy had written on her job application but there’s more I’d like you to hear:“We must be taught to pursue truth in all areas no matter how painful that can be at times. For in pursuing truth we also experience great pleasure. And it is the true educator’s hope that in pursuing truth her students will come to know truth in its fullness God himself.”I think that’s exactly what Katy McShane did: She helped us to “come to know truth in its fullness God himself.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1530
1532,Feb. 16 2011 11:10 a.m.,Terry Schneider,By Jack Weiland  Terry Schneider Terry was born September 27 1938 in Cincinnati Ohio and grew up there the oldest of five children. He died suddenly at the age of 71 on February 11 2010 while wintering in Florida. He had a wonderful life. Terry met Sue in 1957 and they were married in 1960. They became one in marriage and one in Christ and it’s next to impossible to speak about one without the other. After a stint in Fort Sill Oklahoma the Schneiders moved to Cincinnati where Terry served for seven years in the Army Reserves. During that time they started their family of two daughters Lisa and Lynn and then two sons Terry and Todd—all in five years. Every year Terry would insist they take a camping vacation. They would load up the family station wagon attach the pop-up camper and head out to explore America. They went everywhere—two adults four kids no iPods video games or TVs—on the road for weeks at a time. The kids learned a lot of skills from Terry like how to build a blazing campfire how to roast a perfect marshmallow how to determine the melting point of aluminum cans and how to share oneself around the campfire. In 1973 Terry and Sue went to a Scripture course led by Fr. Richard Rohr and through this they were introduced to the charismatic renewal and gave their lives to God in a new way. They soon started the Open Door Prayer Group in their parish. In 1975 they became foster parents and continued this ministry until 1980 when Champion International Terry’s employer transferred him to Stamford Connecticut. They were there four years when once again Terry got a transfer order this time to Minneapolis and found what the Lord had been leading them to—community life in Servants of the Lord. It was a wonderful marriage between them and the community who reached out to embrace them and their growing family. They made the covenant of the People of Praise on September 15 1987. Terry and Sue became foster parents again after arriving in Minnesota. They welcomed two Vietnamese refugees into their home in December of 1980. Phoung Hoa and Cho Do were 12 and 16 years old when they arrived and are still part of their family. Terry taught them math Sue taught them English. Terry and Sue went on to foster many newborn babies. In one year alone they welcomed 10 newborns. Terry was ordained as a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church in 1997 on his birthday September 27. He truly enjoyed this ministry serving at Holy Name of Jesus Church in Medina their home parish and also at the Church of Saint Anne in Hamel as well as being both deacon and business administrator at the Church of St. John in St. Paul. Terry was a men's group head for a good number of years and he and Sue were part of the prayer team for healing that ministers before each community meeting. Both Terry and Sue were known for their willingness to pray with people especially those with physical ailments. Terry would say “Our job is to pray; the Lord’s job is to heal.” In January of 2007 while he and Sue were in Florida sitting around the pool a young man came by and Terry noticed he seemed to be in pain. The man told the Schneiders he had a severe back injury and hadn’t been able to work for over a year. Terry and Sue took him into their condo and prayed over him. After 30 minutes he said the pain was gone and it was the first time he felt the Lord near him in a long time. He must have told the whole condo complex because the next day Terry and Sue had 11 people knocking on their door to be prayed over and many reported feeling at peace and receiving healing in some way as well! Terry made every attempt to be a part of the important events in the lives of his children and more recently his grandchildren. He was there for graduations First Communions and award ceremonies and had the thrill of baptizing several of his grandchildren. He was a great fishing instructor at the dock: willing to teach proper technique and do all the night crawler dirty work. He was the ultimate fan at any sporting events where his grandchildren were participating going to every game possible and sometimes letting the refs know he didn’t like their calls. Those who knew Terry well will tell you he was a great listener and he was always very generous. In fact his kindness was wonderful. He was always willing to give a helping hand. He never bragged about anything—with the possible exception of his wife kids grandkids and most of the other people he met. He had a spirit of healing about him. He was a strong family man and a man of action quickly responding to others’ needs. He was nonjudgmental always positive. He loved the Lord. Terry was the boater guy the camp director guy the wallpaper guy the guy with the camera (he loved his pictures) the dessert guy the coach and grill master the gardener who loved a meticulous lawn the grandfather who had game night with his grandchildren and the guy who was always on time especially for church. In fact he used to say “If you weren’t 10 minutes early you were late.” Terry was a loving husband father grandfather brother uncle deacon friend and mentor. A man who truly loved Christ.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1532
1531,Feb. 16 2011 11:07 a.m.,Areta Thomas,By Renee Long Areta Thomas made the covenant of the People of Praise in September of 2008 at the age of 82! She wanted to belong to the People of Praise because it was Christ-centered and she wanted to live in Christ. She passed away to continue eternal life with Christ on January 16 2010.  Areta Thomas Near the end of her life she lived with her daughter and son-in-law Fran and Marty Willard (Servant Branch) and their six children where she had many opportunities to use her gift of hospitality. Her beautiful smile and the delight in her voice made each visitor feel welcome and loved. The Willard house was a gathering place for many of the children in the neighborhood and Areta was “Yiayia”—the Greek name for Grandma—to all of them. For several years Areta’s women’s group met every Monday at four p.m. around Areta’s dining room table. Of course four p.m. was always prime time for children to be knocking at the Willard door. So the women’s group sat together sharing praying laughing crying and drinking tea while the doorbell rang and young children walked and at times ran through the kitchen. It wasn't unusual for Areta’s women’s group to join hands and bow heads in prayer at one end of the table while a couple of seven-year-old girls sat at the other end of the table quietly eating a snack. Areta Liacakes was born in Dearborn Michigan July 27 1926. She was the oldest of five children and was of Greek heritage. She was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church and this enriched her life and love of the Lord in many ways throughout her life. She deeply loved and respected her Orthodox tradition. A favorite thing for her to say was “Christos Anesti!”—which is Greek for “Christ is risen!” Dearborn had a large active Greek community and the neighborhoods and businesses reflected their life together. As a young woman Areta worked in the family restaurant in Dearborn called the Dearborn Family Restaurant. Henry Ford often came in to eat the apple pie. She grew up working hard and she assumed that work was simply something that had to be done without asking a lot of questions. Money was hard to come by so that meant that people just rolled up their sleeves and “worked.” (She smiled when she said that!) Her daughter Fran said that her mom made all her own clothes and hats. She would go to the fine department stores with paper and pencil and sketch the clothes she liked and then make them herself at home without a pattern. After she was married Areta was also a working mom. She worked as a pharmacy technician and also had a weekend business with her husband making and selling pizzas for customers to take home and bake. She went back to school in her 50s to become a legal secretary and then operated and owned her own secretarial service for the next 20 years. She often spoke of the value of a higher education and encouraged others to be fearless in their pursuit of that. Areta was married for 52 years to Louis Thomas also of Greek heritage. They met on an arranged date in September 1949. Areta’s Uncle Bill knew Lou’s father and they came up with a plan to have them meet. The plan was for Uncle Bill and his wife to take Areta to dinner at a supper club. Lou’s dad then called him at college and said “Come home on the bus and bring your best pants—today!” Lou complied and came home. Lou and his parents went to the supper club where Uncle Bill and his wife and Areta were waiting. Lou was introduced to Areta. After dinner the two married couples stood up abruptly and said “We’re leaving!” Lou’s dad threw a set of car keys on the table and the four matchmakers left—only to hide behind some pillars to watch what would happen. Areta told that story with a laugh every time! Lou and Areta were married 10 months later. They raised five children together. Lou’s mother would live with them for 20 years; they would add 16 grandchildren to the family share the joy of living in beautiful Lake City Minnesota and travel together to France Budapest London Alaska and Hawaii. They would also experience the loss of their son Bill to cancer in April 2002. Areta’s beloved Lou died in November 2002. She experienced deep grief when she lost son husband brother grandson and daughter-in-law within a few short years but she held on to the Lord asking him to give her strength. She moved to a nursing home in 2009 and saw that as an opportunity to be able to spend more time with her son and his family who lived nearby. She reached out to others at the nursing home and brought comfort to the woman she shared a room with. Areta had always loved having her grandchildren around her and her death brought them all together one more time. Areta was a woman of prayer. She prayed for many brothers and sisters in the People of Praise and she prayed for those who did not know the Lord because she had a great concern for humanity for all the people of the world. She often talked and prayed about current events taking place in the world. Her service was intercession and as her health declined she interceded even more. Areta is remembered for her great love for her faithfulness to the Lord in difficult times and for her concern for others. She was loved by many. Just ask the children! They know.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1531
1533,Feb. 16 2011 9:04 a.m.,Jean Chambers,By Tom Noe  Jean Chambers “We experienced Christ in Jean and that changed us and we are very glad for that.” With these words Patrick Pingel opened the wake for our covenanted sister Jean Chambers who died on August 22. All who spoke that evening echoed Patrick’s words as well as echoing his joy. Jean Kline was born in Mishawaka IN November 17 1945 and lived there her whole life. She and Stan were next-door neighbors as teens and they married on June 25 1965. She worked as a long-distance operator for Indiana Bell until their sons Matt and Andy were born then she stayed home to care for them. She attended evening classes for seven years at IUSB to earn her master’s degree in education and special education. After the boys started school she began a teaching career that continued for 34 years: first in special education and then in elementary school the third and fourth grades. She said she loved teaching those grades because the kids were still young enough that you could hug them and they were old enough that they could really start learning. Stan says Jean always wanted to be a teacher: “In high school that’s all she ever talked about doing. She felt she was doing something important for the kids by teaching.” Her students loved her in return. One day a few years back after chemotherapy had caused her to lose all her hair and she had started wearing a turban her entire class wore turbans or scarves just to be in sync with her. Stan and Jean were watching local television news one night in 1973 and saw coverage of the Catholic charismatic conference at Notre Dame. Cardinal Suenens was talking about being baptized in the Spirit and having a personal relationship with Jesus. Stan had been raised Baptist and knew what a personal relationship with Jesus was. Jean didn’t quite know what to make of it. But both were intrigued to hear this Roman Catholic cardinal talking about it. Well in fact they were more than just intrigued says Stan. They had an argument about who had a better relationship with God! They decided the only way to settle the question was to go to a charismatic prayer meeting and find out. So they showed up at the Wednesday night meeting in the basement of Christ the King church in South Bend. After the meeting Stan asked her “What did you think?” Jean said “I don’t know about you but I’ll be back next week.” They didn’t miss a meeting after that and soon formed strong bonds with many of the regulars. On the way to the prayer meeting on Wednesdays Stan would pick up riders such as Tom and Helen Rudd then swing by to pick up Jean at IUSB as her class was ending. “I don’t think we were able to make the first Life in the Spirit Seminar at Christ the King” he recalls “but it was one of the first.” When it came to joining the People of Praise Stan and Jean were just as decisive: “We were called to it we never had any second thoughts.” They made the covenant on September 24 1977. Over the years they had three periods of household life: with Tom and Karen Yoder for two or three years with Jay Conway and her son Luke for four or five years and with Geoff and Sue Kelleher for several months while they were in the process of moving to South Bend from Hawaii. Jean led a women’s group for a time and worked at the community’s LaSalle Restaurant. She also served regularly on deliverance teams at the weekly prayer meetings and at the annual Notre Dame conferences. Jean excelled at being realistic and practical. She frequented garage sales and the branch’s used goods room in the LaSalle Building to find second-hand clothes for herself but bought new things for her sons. Helen Rudd recalls “She always made sure everyone was taken care of. At restaurants she’d always order some unusual appetizer and then pass it around so we all had a chance to taste it whatever it was. She was always getting books and recommending them or loaning them out. She also loaned out Stan—when she heard about a need she’d say ‘Stan’ll help you!’” Mary Lou Cressy described Jean as “really down to earth a person of good will. She loved her family and her co-workers and her students and when you were around her you always felt great. She always thought the best of everybody.” Melanie Decker told a story about Jean’s practical care for others: “One time when Stan and Jean were driving home from Florida they were miles down the road when they found out one of their grandkids was sad from missing a grandmotherly hug before they left. So they turned right around and drove back to give that grandchild a hug.” Jean went through a bout with cancer 23 years ago and the disease returned two and a half years ago. Melanie recalls “She talked very matter-of-factly about it where and how it was spreading but never complained. She believed in her heavenly Father and knew that he would care for her.” “The last few months she really missed going to the branch meetings” says Stan “but her women’s group came over all the time brought her Communion prayed with her shared with her. She was blessed when about 25 area members came over to the house and played guitar and sang. She loved it.” “She loved the community” he adds. “Being in the community gave her friendships with so many godly women. They influenced her and she influenced them. They prayed together they partied together. You don’t see those kinds of relationships a lot in the world.” As we gathered together at the wake to honor Jean many people quoted 1 Corinthians and Proverbs 31 and rightly so but a simple phrase in Maureen McDonough’s sharing seemed to summarize the breadth and the height and the extent of Jean’s life: “Love spread its wings.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1533
1527,Feb. 16 2011 9 a.m.,Leonard Kadera,By John Ostby  Leonard Kadera Leonard Kadera a dear brother in Servant Branch who was full of curiosity and a profound sense of the bright fullness of life died on January 5 2010. He was born in Iowa in 1913 one of six children. His early years growing up on a farm prepared him well for life and also seemed to prepare him for a natural transition into Christian community life in Servant Branch years later. After being introduced by friends he and Edith were married on June 4 1940 and they enjoyed 68 years of life together with 13 children 60 grandchildren and 46 great-grandchildren. (Edith died from complications of pneumonia in August 2008.) Leonard and Edith started their family about the same time he started a TV repair business. As their family grew in size they moved to Minnesota and Leonard started working with computers in St. Paul. They were baptized in the Holy Spirit in the early 1970s and became active in a charismatic prayer group through which they helped to bring many people to the Lord. Leonard’s daughter-in-law Gina Kadera says “My husband Jim and I noticed the joy and peace that had entered their lives and so we followed Leonard and Edith being baptized in the Spirit ourselves in 1973. In 1976 we joined Servants of the Lord community in the Twin Cities area and this time Leonard and Edith followed us joining the community several years later.” Leonard and Edith made the covenant of the People of Praise on April 14 1985. Also members of the community besides Jim and Gina are Leonard and Edith’s granddaughter Julie and her husband Mark Olson. Christopher Kadera Julie’s son (Leonard and Edith’s great-grandson) is in Action in Servant Branch. Life in Christian community was a perfect fit for Leonard and Edith. After retiring in the early 1980s they moved from St. Paul to a rural area near Prescott Wisconsin. This placed them in the East Area of Servant Branch. With that move this friendly couple became a dear brother and sister to many in the East Area. Their retirement farm was the site of numerous area activities. Ed Kaiser as a young single man away from home remembers the Kaderas opening up their home and inviting him to join their family for Thanksgiving dinner. Claudia Schmitz recalls Leonard and Edith’s loving and wise advice to her as she and her husband Tony were just starting out as new parents. Jerry and Patricia Rynda tell about the time when Leonard was helping them to wire their new house and Leonard actually did a pull-up to get into the attic. He was in his late 70s when he pulled that stunt! For many years Leonard was very active in Scouting. He always seemed to know what would interest youngsters especially boys. Once he invited a group of young East Area boys and dads out for an afternoon of adventure at the Kadera acreage in Wisconsin. Leonard enjoyed getting a bonfire blazing and roasting hot dogs. His eyes were especially bright as the boys “discovered” a drainage pipe just wide enough for them to crawl through. Leonard and Edith were an example of provident and resourceful living. They built their retirement house to be very energy-efficient and they always had a large garden planted in the summer. Brothers and sisters in the East Area were invited to stop out and pick some vegetables or fruit that was ripe. If that didn’t take care of the sometimes enormous Kadera surplus Leonard would load up the extra produce in boxes and bring it to an area gathering or a men’s group meeting. He would have a huge smile and that familiar twinkle in his eye as folks took home what he called the “gifts from God’s country” that he brought to share. Leonard was a faithful husband father grandfather great-grandfather and brother in Christ. He and Edith were open-hearted and available to help anyone who needed them. As Edith’s health declined Leonard cared for her with great love patience and peace. They lived in a nursing home for the two years before her death and after that Leonard continued to participate in as many branch activities as he could. He was a wonderful man who lived out well the verse that reminds us to “Rejoice in the Lord always.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1527
1487,Feb. 7 2011 10:29 p.m.,Chasing After God,By Chris Meehan About 6:00 on a Saturday evening in late January missionaries Rus Lyons Peter Putzier and Joe Bulger were standing at a gas station in tiny Hartford Kentucky—64 miles from Evansville. They’d walked 36 miles over three days of hitchhiking and sharing the gospel with people in small towns. The trip had been one of their toughest—at least in terms of catching rides. Previous trips had always brought them home in time to open the Lord’s Day with their fellow missionaries to tell stories and rejoice together in what the Lord had done. But it was already too late for that. Darkness had set in limiting their options. They’d learned by experience that it’s practically impossible to hitchhike after dark. They had been exchanging text messages with Nick Holovaty in Evansville about their predicament. “Call Evan Reinhardt” he wrote. As the missionaries sat down to open the Lord’s Day Nick led them in a prayer for their brothers asking God to bring them home by 7:45. With hope and a prayer Rus dialed Evan. Evan is a 29-year-old Christian who lives in Owensboro Kentucky a town about halfway between Evansville and Hartford. On a previous hitchhiking trip he had stopped his truck to pick up Nick and two other missionaries telling them that he felt his truck was a gift from God and that he wanted to do something good with it. To their surprise Evan was already in Hartford visiting a friend about a quarter mile from where the missionaries were. He eagerly agreed to wrap up his visit and drive them as far as his gas supply would allow. When Nick found out that Evan was driving the missionaries he called and invited Evan to come to Evansville and spend the night with the missionaries. Evan happily jettisoned his evening plans and drove the missionaries all the way back. “You gotta chase after God” he said. They arrived in Evansville just after 7:45 after most of the missionaries had eaten. Everybody was eager to meet Evan and hear stories from the trip. (The previous evening in Bowling Green Kentucky the hitchhikers had prayed with three college students for baptism in the Holy Spirit.) As he ate Evan kept pausing to comment on the food: “This is amazing! Five-star restaurant quality!” The next morning Nick and Rus showed Evan how to make a Scriptural meditation and Evan made one before he needed to leave to make it to his church service. Before he left he commented on the fellowship he’d experienced in that short time telling Nick “This is what everybody wants but not many people have it.” He hopped into his truck waved and took off—but stopped after 20 feet stuck his head out the window and thanked the missionaries one more time. “We’ve met lots of people like Evan in our missionary work” Nick says “Christians who are hungry for fellowship and willing to chase after God even if that means driving 60 miles to be with us for the Lord’s Day. The Lord is connecting the Christians in the Mississippi Valley. He is building a network of believers.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1487
1483,Feb. 7 2011 10:27 p.m.,One:Ten Launches Web Site for Ave Maria Press,By Sean Connolly  Top row from left: David Salmon President of One:Ten Lead Developer Jeremy Osterhouse Graphic Designer Jennifer Kenning. Bottom row: Programmer Collin Anderson Project Manager Laura Ficker and Front End Developer Lisa Ficker. One:Ten Communications launched its new web site for Ave Maria Press (avemariapress.com) on January 26. One:Ten (onetencommunications.com) built the site to provide a powerful Internet presence for Ave Maria at a time when technology is rapidly changing the publishing world. Ave Maria president Tom Grady says the new site advances his company’s efforts to sell more books online and to promote online supplements for their books. The press sold 900000 books in 2010 including Catholic high school religion textbooks books on spirituality resources for parish ministry and increasingly e-books and other digital content. Ave Maria is a 144-year-old Catholic publishing house founded by the Congregation of Holy Cross and  located in Notre Dame Indiana. “Ave Maria came to us at a time when both publishing and education are standing at a crossroads because of the Internet” says David Salmon (South Bend) One:Ten’s president. “This new web site puts them in a strong position to serve their current market and to benefit from future Internet-driven changes. We’re very grateful that they entrusted us with the creation of this important component of their business and we look forward to expanding our partnership.” One:Ten based in South Bend is the division of the LaSalle Company that builds web sites for businesses and specializes in serving the needs of publishers. The company has grown to 10 employees since its founding in 2006. “One:Ten did more for us than we thought was possible” Mr. Grady says. “I can’t imagine a more hardworking creative diligent and above all patient group of people.” The new Ave Maria home page includes a carousel of moving book images a banner with rotating ads and news on company products but the biggest innovation lies behind the scenes. One:Ten’s lead developer Jeremy Osterhouse designed features that give Ave Maria control over every aspect of their home page. Ave Maria employees can edit text and swap product information in and out of the page and they have the power to alter the layout. The banner carousel and other design elements can all be rearranged with a few mouse clicks. “We wanted to be able to redesign the home page every day if we wanted to” Mr. Grady says. “We wanted the look and feel of a daily newspaper.” Click on a book image and the site takes you to its product page. Alongside information about author title and price are links to YouTube videos and interviews with authors sneak peeks inside the book related links and easy ways to spread the word about the book on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Ave Maria provides students and teachers with free online supplements for many of its textbooks: classroom handouts crossword puzzles quizzes PowerPoint presentations even sample tests. “These resources are important to teachers and to our business” says Mr. Grady. “We wanted them to be available in an attractive and clear way. One:Ten did that for us.” Another key feature: when customers order books the site can help determine what type of customers they are (parish individual buyer bookstore etc.) and offer volume discounts and other special prices accordingly. This streamlines the ordering process says Mr. Grady. He adds that one of the major reasons he hired One:Ten was their roots in the religious education market as part of the LaSalle Company and their background as a Christian company. “It was terrific to work with a group of people who already understand our mission. We didn’t have to instruct them in what a Catholic high school is all about what a parish is all about what our books are all about. Many times after they left our meetings we would shake our heads in relief and talk about how glad we were to be working with them.” One:Ten computer programmer Collin Anderson (South Bend) says the feeling was mutual: “One highlight for me was building a web site for another Christian business knowing that we were moving the kingdom of God forward together.” Project manager Laura Ficker (South Bend) adds that she appreciated the hard work patience and thoroughness of the Ave Maria staff. “They were a perfect fit for working with us” she says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1483
1452,Jan. 21 2011 9:13 p.m.,Greenlawn Sophomores Study Food Chemistry,By Sean ConnollyThirty-one Trinity School at Greenlawn sophomores spent Project Week working in the chemistry labs at Saint Mary’s College. They were living out an idea hatched by former Greenlawn chemistry teacher Katy McShane (South Bend) a year ago. The students learned lab techniques and designed experiments to reveal the chemistry of everyday objects—pennies aspirin fast food hamburgers even Mountain Dew. The key catalyst for their learning was Dr. Toni Barstis a Saint Mary’s chemistry professor Trinity parent and cancer survivor. Toni and Katy began talking about the idea after last year’s Project Week. They formed a bond through their common enthusiasm for science and their common connection to cancer. After Mrs. McShane died from pancreatic cancer in October her co-chemistry teacher (and the new head of school) John Lee added his enthusiasm and the plan for this year’s Project Week was born. St. Mary’s offered the labs and Dr. Barstis volunteered her time to guide the students.  Christen and Marian (Photos courtesy of Saint Mary's College.) They began with the basics designing experiments to study how the mass of a penny changes after years in circulation. They moved on to synthesizing aspirin and learning a lab technique called thin-layer chromatography which they employed to determine the chemical make up of over-the-counter pain tablets. (This technique could come in handy in a poisoning situation Dr. Barstis explains—if someone swallowed a host of unmarked tablets and their composition had to be determined in a hurry). The students spent the final three days executing their own experiments around common foods and beverages. Many measured the sugar content in soft drinks. Others explored the fat content in burgers the salt content in soups and the calorie content in nuts. All the students prepared formal lab reports to communicate their findings. “I wanted to make sure that the experiments weren’t scripted that the students could create and put their own stamp on their work” Dr. Barstis says. The results? Grace Pingel and Christa Rose tested burgers from McDonalds Burger King and Wendy’s.  They ground the meat liquified it and spun tubes of liquified meat in the centrifuge to isolate the fat from the protein before carefully weighing the fat. The Burger King patty measured in at 28.6% fat while Wendy’s scored the healthiest burger with 14.4% fat. Michael Sayre and Bobby Cramer tested the sugar content in sodas and other drinks. They prepared sugar-water solutions to use as controls and used a homemade hydrometer (basically a small buoy) to measure the density of their solutions. Then they compared the densities of the sodas with the controls to determine sugar content. The two were surprised that Mountain Dew and Arizona lemon tea had similar sugar concentrations—about 17% (the highest concentrations they measured). Nate Griggs and Tim Pingel tackled the salt content in soups. Their experiment involved reacting silver-nitrate with their soup and some chromate ions. The reaction was supposed to yield a red precipitate. But they ran into trouble when testing tomato soup--there was no way to see the precipitate in the red soup.  From left Guanhua Noah Natalee and Alex in the Saint Mary's chemistry lab. This is exactly the sort of real world problem Mr. Lee was hoping students would stumble upon. “When the groups come to a roadblock” he says “they have to collaborate and ask themselves what chemistry do we know that will help us go beyond this?” In the case of the tomato soup Tim and Nate redesigned their experiment to get around the obstacle. “We used a filtering process that we had learned the day before synthesizing aspirin” Tim said. “It was a lot of fun being in a college lab” added sophomore Marian DeLee. “It made us feel more like scientists. I also liked the independence we had. Our teachers didn’t give us a lot of instructions just the basics. We had to figure out how we wanted to make our measurements.” The concentration on the students’ faces and the excited chatter in the lab made the students’ reactions to the week of experiments seem obvious. “My goal was to encourage the students to get them excited about science to take Katy’s energy and build on that” Dr. Barstis said. It’s an experiment that Mr. Lee hopes can be repeated next year.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1452
1442,Jan. 21 2011 9:12 p.m.,Mercy for a Thief,By Chris Meehan After the Lord saved Beth Boyle (Servant Branch) from the theft of her Christmas cash she saw a chance to pass along God’s generosity to the thief. Confronting a thief was the last thing on her mind as she strolled into the entryway of the Cub Foods grocery store the Saturday afternoon before Christmas. All she wanted to do was polish off her Christmas shopping by picking up some made-in-Minnesota specialty items for her South Dakota relatives. She was carrying some extra cash in her purse to make the purchases.  Beth Boyle The store was jammed and so were the carts in the covered entryway. Beth stopped to help a woman untangle her cart. Then as she stepped inside the store with her own cart she noticed a display of Minnesota-grown Honeycrisp apples to her immediate left. She turned to get a better look. “Suddenly I had a strong nudge to turn around and check my cart” she says. “Definitely from the Holy Spirit. A man standing alongside my cart quickly turned away.” Suspicious Beth turned to check her purse. Her wallet was gone. She looked up at the man and caught his eye. “Excuse me sir have you seen my wallet?” “No ma’am” he replied. “Are you sure you didn’t leave it in the car?” “Yes . . . I checked it as I was getting out of the car.” The man began walking toward the store exit but Beth followed. She caught up with him then summoned up a boldness she didn’t know she had. “I’m sorry but can I check your coat?” The man didn’t reply and he didn’t run so Beth patted down the front pockets of his heavy wool overcoat. Unable to find anything but still not at ease she moved into position between the man and the exit and asked if she could summon the manager for a more thorough search. “My mother’s waiting for me” the man said. “I can’t wait for him.” Then he brushed past Beth and ran out the door. Disappointed Beth watched him run. Suddenly a voice called out from behind Beth “Run after him!” It was the woman she had helped with the cart. Encouraged Beth darted after the man who was sprinting across the parking lot toward the street. “Police! Help! Theft!” she yelled as she ran. Abruptly the man turned around. “I’m going to get rid of this” he said as he ran past her. He tossed her wallet through the store’s front doors then ran off again. Beth saw that her money was still inside so she went over to the woman who had helped her out. She hugged and thanked the woman and her mother calling them “the angels in my path.” “We’re praying for you” the woman said. After the conversation she saw that the man was in custody. A policeman came and began asking Beth if she wanted to press charges. He said that the thief had freely admitted to taking her wallet. Beth thought about it for a moment. “What was going through my mind was that God was merciful to protect me and give me back my wallet. So perhaps I could turn around and be merciful—it was a bit of the Christmas spirit.” She told the policeman that she would not press charges but agreed with his suggestion that the man be banned from entering that store in the future. “I left the situation with a grateful heart and a strong desire to pray that it be a life-changing experience for him” she said. “I felt God’s presence every step of the way.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1442
1422,Jan. 14 2011 1:58 p.m.,Community Members Return to Employment,By Chris Meehan In the current weak US job market some community members have emerged from long stretches of unemployment with strengthened faith and paychecks in hand. On smaller salaries and budgets that remain tight they tell of increased trust in God and deep appreciation for the support of the community. Their stories vary revealing no magic formula for finding employment. Hugh Springer Sr. (Servant Branch) found a job with a much a longer commute—295 miles all the way to Neenah Wisconsin. (He stays with Steve and Amee Pable of the Appleton Branch during the week and returns to the Twin Cities on weekends.) On the other hand the job John Fasbender (Servant Branch) found is in nearby downtown Minneapolis. Hugh’s job as manager for a medical products company came after two years of searching and more than 100 interviews. John benefitted from the concern of a brother Brad Bye who heard from a golf buddy about a management job at a title insurance company.  “Brad’s recommendation got me the crucial first interview which ultimately led to the job” John says. The recession hit Muncie hard leaving 10 of the 34 men in the branch unemployed. Three years ago Dan Capstick lost his job of 22 years at auto parts manufacturer BorgWarner. He worked briefly for another company before landing a job with good benefits but a lower salary at Tomasco a parts supplier for Honda. Like John Dan got the job through a community brother who passed his resume along to a supervisor. “I knew something good would eventually happen” Dan says. Servant Branch members Mary Jo Koplos and Paul Putzier took advantage of their unemployment to explore new possibilities. Mary Jo lost her full-time job composing software manuals for the University of Minnesota three years ago. She relied on money saved for just such an emergency and eventually decided to accept several part-time jobs rather than full-time work. “God had to help me see that I need not take the standard 9-to-5 route” she says. “I had to make some cutbacks and take some initiative but the Lord took care of me.” She is currently writing product descriptions substitute teaching editing a newsletter and writing features for a news web site based in Eagan Minnesota. The last job allows her to write stories about the community and Trinity School both based in Eagan. Paul Putzier a geologist by training researched a variety of new occupations before launching his own business. He is now a job placement specialist helping people find new lines of work after suffering injuries. Jim Reinhardt a professional in this field helped Paul get the business going. “I encounter the Lord every day in my work and routinely pray with clients” Paul says. “It’s tremendously gratifying to help others find work even when it’s as basic as assisting them in creating a resume.” After a slow start-up year Paul says the work is paying well though less than his previous job. Like some of the others he says he relied on the generosity of brothers and sisters to help his family make ends meet. Of course there are still community members who remain unemployed. Jon Cassady (northern Virginia) lost his marketing job with IBM in March 2009. He plugs ahead with vigor—networking and interviewing—with an encouraging word always at the ready. In the meantime he has lent some of his expertise to the LaSalle Company and its web site development division One:Ten Communications.  As far as Jon is concerned unemployment just like employment is an opportunity to serve. “I have a new mindset now: whether I have a job or not God is my employer.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1422
1417,Jan. 14 2011 1:31 p.m.,Seen and Heard in Evansville,By Chris Meehan “So what do you have to do to join this thing? How do you get in?” asked Devon Wallace. He had just spent the afternoon knocking on doors alongside Evansville missionary Rus Lyons. “Well we’re part of an ecumenical charismatic covenant Christian community” Rus began. “I don’t know what any of those words mean” Devon said “but I’m in!” Earlier that day Rus was getting ready to hop into the missionaries’ minivan and head to Rockport Indiana a nearby town where a few other missionaries were already knocking on doors. Then he remembered Devon a 31-year-old Christian who had been coming to the men’s group meetings the missionaries host. Rus called him and asked if he’d like to tag along for the day’s mission work. “I’m leaving in five minutes” Rus said. Devon agreed and a few minutes into the 35-minute drive burst into spontaneous prayer. “Thank you Lord for sending this man of God to pick me up so we can go do your will. This is awesome!” “Someday Devon may come underway” Rus remarked later. “But for now I’d have to say I agree with him. He’s one of us. He really loves God and he loves us and what we’re doing. We're including him in our plans for the future in Evansville.” Devon has already joined the missionaries for a second afternoon of knocking on doors.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1417
1402,Jan. 7 2011 1:30 p.m.,In Allendale Holiday Hams Arrive on Time,By Chris Meehan The Tuesday before Christmas Patti Deakin looked out her window in Allendale and discovered a man dropping off some heavy boxes on the front porch of the house next door. Patti went over and found seven packages each containing ham vegetables fruit potatoes and cookies enough food to serve as Christmas dinner for a family of six. The food came from the youth group at the Catholic parish some of the community members in Allendale attend. The same church had given the Allendale Christians in Mission team some Turkey dinners at Thanksgiving but Patti says “we had no idea there would be food to distribute this Christmas.” Patti her husband Gerry and Nathan Barrett talked about whom they might give them to and they quickly came up with six names. “Since Christmas comes at the end of the month many Allendale residents were low on food stamps and these gifts were much appreciated” Patti says. They needed a seventh name and Gerry thought of Karl a disabled vet who frequently rides his bicycle down Yale Avenue. Though Gerry saw Karl frequently his personality had remained something of a mystery. It had taken Gerry more than a year even to learn his name. Then bit by bit Gerry had pieced together some of his story. He was a former drug addict who earned money by doing yardwork. He was also trying to help his wife get through a 90-day program to overcome her own drug addiction. But Gerry didn’t know where Karl lived or if he had a stove to cook the food or a refrigerator to store it in. The next day Karl knocked on Gerry’s door and Gerry asked him if he had a working stove and refrigerator. He did so Gerry offered him the food. Karl’s eyes grew big and he gave a wide grin. “Nobody ever does that for me Mr. Gerry” he said. “But the Lord is going to do it for you today!” Gerry replied.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1402
1386,Jan. 7 2011 12:59 p.m.,Kingston Holds Lessons and Carols For 300,The Kingston branch hosted a Festival of Lessons and Carols in Holy Trinity Cathedral in December. By Chris Meehan The Kingston branch held a large Festival of Lessons and Carols on Sunday December 19. Ushers estimated that 300 people attended the ecumenical service put on by the 30-member branch. “In previous years we held the service in the high school performing arts hall where we normally meet which can hold 100 people” says Kevin Rodriguez one of the organizers of this year’s event. “But it’s been on our hearts to share the experience with more people.” There was no shortage of space in Kingston’s 100-year-old Holy Trinity Cathedral site of this year’s service which the branch put on in collaboration with members of the cathedral parish. Kingston’s Roman Catholic Archbishop Donald James Reese offered a welcome to the crowd.  The Kingston branch music ministry with guest instrumentalists from the Alpha home for boys. Branch member Sam Davis gave one of several reflections during the traditional pre-Christmas service which includes a series of reflections and Scripture readings interspersed with Christmas hymns. “The new people I encountered were very very happy to be there” he said. Three guest instrumentalists from a nearby home for boys added saxophone flute and clarinet to the usual bass drums and guitar in the branch’s music ministry and another guest played the keyboard. Branch members pitched in to promote and prepare for the event. “I handed out flyers at my church. I also brought along family members and they loved it” said Dorothy Over. “The event put us in the mood for Christmas by reminding us what it’s really all about” added Dawn Keaveny.. Holy Trinity’s pastor has already invited the branch to host the event again in 2011.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1386

By Chris Meehan Locksley Robinson was appointed to lead the Kingston branch in December. He follows Vince Keaveny who has led the branch since its inception in 1986. “Vince’s work establishing the People of Praise in Jamaica has been tireless and effective” said Kevin Ranaghan chair of the branch relations council. “With the support of his wife Dawn Vince has been the father of our People of Praise life there.”  Vince Keaveney Vince will continue to serve as a member of the branch leaders team. “Vince has always given everything he’s got to the Lord and to the branch” says Locksley.

1358,Dec. 27 2010 12:10 p.m.,In Evansville A Flat Tire Sparks A Friendship,By Chris Meehan Rus Lyons one of our missionaries in Evansville glanced down a narrow Evansville street and noticed a young man trying to remove a flat tire with a broken tire iron. Rus grabbed the iron from the missionaries’ car and went over to help the man whose name was Reese. Fellow missionary Mary Timler stood in the cold chatting with Reese’s mother-in-law Tara. They pulled and yanked and occasionally jumped on the iron trying to loosen the lug nuts. While they labored Rus told a few healing stories. Reese said he didn’t go to church and had never seen a miracle. They eventually got the tire off and then the whole group went into Tara’s apartment to warm up. They met Reese’s wife Octavia and their son Amaria. Then after a few minutes Reese began rubbing his knees and grimacing. Squatting in the street had triggered some serious knee pain a 10 on the scale of 1 to 10 he said. Rus offered to pray and when Reese agreed the group laid their hands on him and prayed for a healing. Afterward Reese straightened his leg then bent it. He got up and walked around and then he tried squatting. “Whoa! . . . Wow!” he said looking over at Rus. “Thank you man! There’s no pain!” Rus and Mary spoke to them about prayer and invited them to pray privately for 10 minutes. Afterward Reese said he had realized that he and Octavia had never prayed together. Mary and Rus began explaining baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues but Reese mentioned that he was skeptical of the healing services he’d seen on TV. Laughing Rus pointed at his knee and said “But what was that that just happened to somebody’s knee?” “I know that was real” Reese said. Reese Octavia and Tara each said they’d like to be prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit but after nearly three hours of work and conversation Mary and Rus had to leave. When they came back a week later they found Tara yelling on the phone. She hung up and started waving her arms around menacingly. “If that woman ever comes over here I’m going to deck her.” Mary and Rus helped her calm down and talked to her about Jesus’ words about turning the other cheek. “Getting all upset—that’s what the old Tara would do” she finally said. “I’ve changed. God saw I was going to get angry so he sent his angels to show up at the right time bringing the Holy Spirit.” All three still wanted to be prayed with to be baptized in the Spirit so Rus and Mary laid hands on each in turn. “I feel a lot better than when you first met me” Tara said. Reese said he thought the Lord wanted him to apply for a job—he had recently been laid off. “Whenever you are here I can’t stop smiling” added Octavia. The missionaries have been back to visit a third time.  “I’m hearing God speak to me all the time” Octavia said. Reese is beginning to talk about some hard changes he wants to make in his life and he’s getting good advice--thanks to a missionary friend who has time to give . . . and a working tire iron.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1358
1345,Dec. 27 2010 12:05 p.m.,3 High School Students Join Oahu Branch,From left: Rachel McCabe Zach Busekrus and Racquel Kaikanani Leong.  By Chris Meehan Three high school students have come underway in the Oahu branch. Action trips the community’s music and a desire for Christian friendships all played roles in attracting the students. Zach Busekrus has many family members in the community. His email address includes the phrase “Busekrus and proud of it” but he says it wasn’t obvious that he would follow the family tradition. “My Action trip to Indianapolis changed my perspective” he says. “I saw that the community is trying to make a difference in the world. I wanted to be a part of that.” He already has some solid experience as a difference-maker. Last year Zach organized classmates to produce a video on the genocidal violence in the Darfur region of Sudan.  The video “One Day for Darfur” combines an interview with a Holocaust survivor and some graphic footage of genocide victims accompanied by a reggae tune. The video won first prize (out of 500 entries) in the Youth Xchange Video Competition sponsored by Hawaii public television. It also caught the attention of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pam who have helped Zach and his classmates meet some Darfur aid workers and refugees and have also funded some of their activities. Racquel Kaikanani Leong hadn’t heard of the community at all until she started tagging along when her mother was working at the parish where the branch meets. She noticed the sound of singing echoing out of the church basement. “There was something about the music that drew me in” she says. “It was like a calling and it intrigued me to no end.” She eventually spoke to Mike Busekrus Zach’s Dad who invited her to a meeting. “I checked it out and I soon joined Action and loved it.” Racquel traveled to Allendale last summer and came underway in the fall. Her interest in music and songwriting have led her to start writing raps and she performed one of her compositions at a recent branch meeting. Rachel McCabe first considered coming underway after seeing the community’s impact on her sister Mary (Servant Branch) now a student at the University of Minnesota. But before making the decision to join herself she went on two Action trips to Allendale. “Allendale’s day camp and home-repair projects make it a cool place for people my age who love God” she says. The opportunity for Christian friendships in the Oahu branch also helped draw her in. “People in the community have God in their lives. It’s hard to find people on fire for God at school” she says. Oahu branch leader Tom Duddy says he’s grateful that the Lord brought these three students into the People of Praise. “They add enthusiasm and energy to our branch and that encourages us all.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1345

1240,Oct. 1 2010 6:14 a.m.,In South Bend Two Fires in One Year,By Sean Connolly A fire severely damaged the home of Larry and Valerie Day (South Bend) on September 10. The blaze melted pots and pans burned through walls and destroyed part of the roof. The home’s inside is mostly ruined but its brick exterior is intact. Fortunately no one was inside the house when the fire started. Larry Valerie and their son Caleb a senior at Trinity School at Greenlawn saw smoke billowing from roof vents after returning home late in the evening from a Trinity School event.  Larry Day. Photo: Mary Seale  The fire came 10 months after a smaller smoky fire ruined furniture and damaged the hardwood floors in the Days’ combined living room and dining room. The recent fire destroyed everything that was refinished after the first fire. “We’d only had some of the replacement furniture a few months” Larry says. Homeless twice in one year the Days turned to their neighbors and long-time friends Joe and Karen Heintzelman (South Bend). The Heintzelmans had hosted the Days for two months following the first fire and welcomed them in again until the Days can move to an apartment where they’ll stay until their house is fully renovated. “If there’s a silver lining it’s that our 1955 house will be brought up to 2010 standards” Larry says. “Everything will be redone.” Larry expects the renovation to take at least four months. For the Heintzelmans welcoming the Days into their house was a natural reaction. Joe and Larry have worked together at the LaSalle Company for more than two decades. “I’m very much like Larry’s brother part of the family” Joe explains. The Heintzelmans also intimately understand the disruptive chaos a fire can cause. In 1994 a fire destroyed the inside of their home and Joe Karen and their children lived for about a year in a house owned by the Sisterhood in South Bend. Joe has been advising Larry on rebuilding—drawing on his experience after his own fire and his years as a contractor doing remodeling jobs.  Valerie Day. Photo: Michelle Herrli Valerie counts the Heintzelmans’ help as one in a string of blessings. “The day after the second fire was our 34th wedding anniversary” she says. “Ralph and Pat Rath (South Bend) have an anniversary around the same time and so they took us out to dinner. That was so special for us.” Other brothers and sisters offered meals invited the Days over laundered the smoke from their clothes and helped the Days inventory possessions. Larry marvels at how the Lord has cared for his family in tragedy giving them the chance to stay not just with old friends but with friends who have been through a life-changing fire and a rebuilding of their own. “In the community there are people who have had similar experiences and are really good at understanding your needs” he says. “My family is the People of Praise.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1240

1248,Sept. 30 2010 10:16 p.m.,Hitchhiking On Faith In Southern Indiana,From left: Peter Putzier Peter Coleman (obscured) and Rus Lyons return from a hitchhiking trip. Photo credit: Nick HolovatyBy Chris Meehan and Sean ConnollyThe Evansville missionary men finished their third of three hitchhiking trips through the cities and rural towns of southern Indiana in mid-September. In the spirit of Jesus’ earliest disciples they set out without food or coin. They carried only a few possessions—Bibles songbooks water bottles cell phones and one change of clothes each. They begged meals rides and places to stay offering strangers in towns like Chandler Booneville and Rockport the same prophetic message: God wants to unite everyone in the Mississippi Valley in Christian community.They came through the trips healthy and with stories to tell—of impromptu prayer meetings held in kitchens and dining rooms of strangers prayed with for healing or baptism in the Holy Spirit of fellow Christians who took care of them along the way. “We never slept outside and we never missed a meal” notes Rus Lyons who led the trips which involved three missionaries each. Along with Rus Joe Bulger Peter Coleman Ryan Hardin and Peter Putzier participated. All told the men prayed with more than 15 people to be baptized in the Holy Spirit led two teenagers to dedicate their lives to Jesus and witnessed a woman healed of chronic pain. Sometimes the timing of their arrivals was better than anyone might have planned. In Terre Haute in mid-July during their first trip they dropped by a campus ministry building near Indiana State University and found six students who had been discussing living together in Christian households. The missionaries proceeded to lead several prayer meetings for students and prayed with one man for baptism in the Holy Spirit. Later in the same city they were knocking on a door when a woman fell from her bicycle and spilled a backpack full of groceries onto her front lawn. “Are you Christians?” the woman asked as the missionaries helped her pick up the food. “I saw you knocking and knew it was the Lord who sent you.” The missionaries prayed with the woman and her son to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. Another Terre Haute woman invited the missionaries in for a meal where they were joined by various relatives and friends. They discussed Christian community and ended the evening singing and dancing together around the dining room table. Their second trip took them to Washington Indiana where a man told them that he had been praying for several months about living with other Christians. He asked to come visit the missionaries in Evansville to learn more about community. Several people in Washington told them about Matthew a serious Christian interested in community. The missionaries located his house where Matthew and his wife invited the missionaries in for a meal with three friends. Later that night the group asked the missionaries to teach them how to have a prayer meeting. All five asked to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and several in the group spoke in tongues. Later Matthew called Rus to tell him about the ripple effects. He had prayed with 10 people at his church and those 10 had prayed with many others in their congregation. On the third hitchhiking trip a woman named Angela drove the missionaries to Dale Indiana (pop. 1200). As they drank Powerades she’d bought them they explained their goal of finding people the Lord had been preparing for Christian community. “You’ll find the people you’re looking for today” Angela said. The men also prayed with her for wisdom in raising her 15-year-old son. That night the missionaries were getting hungry and wondering where they would stay. As they walked the streets praying they came upon a man Peter building the framework for a wooden deck. They asked for some food and Peter’s wife Carolyn agreed to make them a meal and to put them up. The men spent their evening helping Peter with his deck and talking with Peter and Carolyn about baptism in the Holy Spirit. Carolyn had already been prayed with but the men prayed with Peter for baptism in the Spirit and prayed with Carolyn for chest pain wrapping up their prayers around midnight. Carolyn was feeling well enough to complete a 5K race the next morning. Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty says the missionaries will likely continue to make short hitchhiking trips. “When the brothers go out hitchhiking they’re doing it on behalf of all of us carrying the word of the Lord to the people he loves throughout the region.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1248
1192,Sept. 17 2010 3:21 p.m.,In Evansville the Word is Getting Out,"From left missionaries Annie Bulger (now returned to college) Abby Earhart and Mary Timler. By Sean Connolly Joe Bulger and Mary Timler moved through an Evansville neighborhood dotted with trailers dirt lots and modest homes. Two women—Bethany and Stephanie—sat on a screened-in porch talking. The missionaries knew Stephanie already and joined in the conversation. When the talk turned to cancer the missionaries told a story from the day before. A woman with osteoarthritis in her neck had been healed of severe pain. “It’s all gone” the woman had said after they’d finished praying. As the healing story tumbled out Bethany looked surprised and then she started talking excitedly. “I have a friend who has a whole group of Christians living up the street from her” she said. Joe and Mary looked at each other. Now they were surprised. Bethany continued “They just prayed with her for her shoulder and it was healed.” Mary made the connection. “Oh you know LeAnn too!” Bethany looked at Joe and Mary. “That was you all?” Sure enough a few miles away on the other side of Evansville the missionaries and LeAnn are neighbors. Bethany and LeAnn are old friends who talk on the phone daily so LeAnn had naturally told Bethany about the Christians who had invited her over for dinner and prayer meetings and had prayed with her shoulder for healing. “Bethany still lives in my old neighborhood” LeAnn explained to the missionaries later. Then LeAnn agreed to go there with the missionaries sometime and talk with her former neighbors about the Lord. “When we go through a neighborhood we don’t always knock on every door” Mary says. “But the Lord is leading us to the doors he wants us to knock on. ""We aren’t yet concentrating on a single neighborhood for our missionary work. We’re fanning out in different areas and now people in many neighborhoods know us. It’s wonderful to see our efforts bearing fruit across the city.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1192
1169,Sept. 17 2010 3:18 p.m.,A Leadership Change in Colorado Springs,Pat Hrbacek (left) and Louis Grams. Photo credit: Phil Ehemann. Pat Hrbacek was appointed to head the Colorado Springs branch on September 10. He follows Louis Grams who has served as the branch's head since 2000. “The vision pastoral care and guidance Louis possesses have done so very much to build this newer branch” said Kevin Ranaghan chair of the branch relations council. “There is no way to express adequately everyone’s gratitude to him. “Louis has faced health problems in recent years including a number of surgeries and recoveries. Pat has been serving as the branch’s acting head for a number of months a job he has done very well. Please pray for Pat as he continues these responsibilities.” Pat and his wife Kara moved to Colorado Springs from Servant branch in 2000 arriving a few months after the Gramses who also came from Servant Branch. (Kara is the daughter of Jim and Carol Rolland of Servant Branch). The Hrbaceks have four daughters. In addition to leading the branch Pat works as an attorney and is a partner in a Colorado Springs law firm. Kara is a stay-at-home mother and part-time high school humanities teacher. “Kara and I have been the recipients of so much love and service from our brothers and sisters in Colorado Springs” Pat says. “So it’s an honor and a privilege for me to serve in this new way especially following Louis who has been a model servant in this position.” In 2006 Louis was bending over to work in his garden when some screws in his back (from a previous surgery) came loose triggering major damage to his autonomic nervous system. He says that doctors understand little about how to repair the autonomic nervous system but a number of specialists can treat his various symptoms—blood pressure swings breathing trouble and fatigue among them. He relies on a portable oxygen machine to assist with his breathing. Louis is quick to add that his doctors have uncovered no connection between his current health problems and the Churg-Strauss syndrome that the Lord healed him of in 1997. He continues to work for Kevin and the branch relations office and he’s a member of the Colorado Springs branch leaders team. He is writing music and beginning to compile the many musical compositions he has penned over the years. “When I was sick before [in the mid-1990s] I was so preoccupied with being sick that it was all I could think about. This is a different experience. I feel well some of the time and when I feel sick I find lots of grace to do what I can do” Louis says. “The Lord has more for me to do and I’m looking forward to what’s next.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1169
1196,Sept. 17 2010 3:13 p.m.,"""You Came At My Lowest Point""",A bridge over the Ohio River near Evansville Indiana. By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly A goateed man named Mark motioned Evansville missionaries Peter Putzier and Mary Grams into his house with one hand pressing a cell phone against his ear with the other. He hung up the phone and launched into the sad story of his last few months: a fall at work leading to an injured back and knees losing his factory job separation from his wife and two sons and heavy drinking. “I’m afraid I’m going to do a really bad thing” he kept repeating. “You know what I’m talking about.” Peter had no doubt. He was talking about ending his life. Peter assured him “The Lord has sent us to help.” The two missionaries prayed with Mark for healing of his knees and back and they cast out evil spirits of fear and despair. “You can praise the Lord in both good times and bad” Peter explained. “You can praise God for your two boys and for keeping you alive so far.” Mark knelt down on the floor littered with empty Diet Coke cans and food wrappers while Peter led a prayer of rededication to the Lord. Peter and Mary taught Mark a cheerful tune “The Lord is my light the Lord is my salvation the stronghold of my life whom shall I fear?” Mark sang it over and over again. “It was the only time I saw him smile that day” Peter recalls. Peter returned to the house the next week this time with missionary Liz Loughran. (Liz has since returned to college.) Mark said he had been talking to his professional counselors more often than he had before and he saw hope in the return of his two sons for a visit. Peter taught him the rudiments of having a personal prayer time and he and Liz introduced another song. But Mark only wanted to sing “The Lord Is My Light” and he insisted that the missionaries write down the words. “You and the other gal saved my life last week” he said to Peter. “You came at my lowest point.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1196

(David is the head of our Christians in Mission team on the South Side of Indianapolis.) Jimmy said he wanted a couple of bucks. David asked “What for?” “A Mountain Dew for my mother.” “I can’t give you money and we don’t have any pop around” David said. “But you know what? We could pray for some and God could give it to you. If God wants you to have some pop he’ll take care of it.” The two prayed quickly then they both forgot about it. The next day Mary Claire Busk also a member of the CIM team called David from the pottery shop where she works. She asked “Do you want some soda?” “How much?” “Lots” Mary Claire said “Mountain Dew Dr. Pepper and Diet Pepsi the good stuff.” The shop had received a new delivery and wanted to get rid of their older cans. “I brought home cases and cases” Mary Claire said “maybe 300 cans.” “We managed to give half of it away immediately” says David “making sure a case of the Mountain Dew went to Jimmy and his mom and the diet soda to some diabetics we know.” A few days later David was visiting Jimmy’s family and wound up talking to Jimmy’s Dad about praying for healing. Jimmy’s Dad had a hard time believing that God could heal someone. “I brought up that God could even answer prayers for Mountain Dew” David remembers. “Yeah” Jimmy chimed in “it works for me.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1194

1083,Sept. 9 2010 8:29 p.m.,For Former Missionaries It's Back to College,By Sean Connolly and Chris Meehan  Annie Bulger and Liz LoughranThis fall four former missionaries are returning to college after completing two years of missionary work. For John Bowar Annie Bulger Liz Loughran and Claire Mysliwiec the move from the mission field to the campus quad brings changes large and small: spending long hours on homework that used to be devoted to evangelism hauling heavy textbooks instead of only a pocket Bible and traveling solo to classes rather than always moving with a small missionary team. So how is the transition going?“Missionaries go back to school with a more mature vision for their own education” notes Nick Holovaty who has observed the transition closely as the program coordinator responsible for the community’s campus divisions. “They’re two years older and they’ve had two years of experiences outside the classroom talking with people from every walk of life.” After wrapping up his missionary work last May John Bowar traveled first to Minnesota for a summer geology research internship and then to Alaska for two weeks of fieldwork. Camping with researchers in Katmai National Park John collected 100-year-old samples of volcanic ash samples that may reveal historical information about the intensity of the earth’s magnetic field.  John Bowar Like missionary work (knocking on doors) geology work (knocking on rocks) is not always glamorous. “My first assignment was breaking small rocks into smaller rocks” John says. “That was fine because I had decided to throw myself into my studies with the same intensity I’d had for missionary life.” Now returned from Alaska John has a bigger course load than ever before (including classes for his geology major) and he’s a member of a busy household of five in Servant Branch’s campus division.Claire a junior history major at the University of Notre Dame says her stint with the missionaries has helped her stay both more focused and more relaxed about her studies. “I’m a lot less concerned about grades than I was before. The reason I am in school is bigger than grades—learning what I can so that I can serve the Lord.”For Claire Annie and Liz at least one important aspect of their lives in Evansville remains the same. After joining the Sisterhood during their missionary stint and living together in household for two years all three are household members once again—this time in one of the households of the Sisterhood in the South Bend branch. (The Sisterhood is a group of women in the People of Praise who are single for the Lord and financially in-common and who live together in several households.) “The simplicity of household life in the Sisterhood has helped me make a fairly smooth transition back to school” Claire says. As an added blessing Claire spent her summer working as an intern in a financial-planning office alongside fellow Sisterhood member Christin Rose. In addition to taking classes in math and biology at Notre Dame Annie and Liz are continuing the part-time jobs they held as missionaries. Both are web site developers for one:ten communications a division of the LaSalle Company that builds web sites for educational publishers. After two years of talking almost daily with strangers the returned students report walking around their campuses with a new awareness—that every person they meet is someone the Lord loves.  “I see myself differently” Claire says. “I have an understanding that the Lord is sending me to people and that’s on my mind as I interact with students and professors.” But the returning students are clear about their primary purpose on campus. “The Lord is calling me to be a student” as Liz puts it. Armed with that call and carrying with them missionary instincts that may never be erased the four are working hard to discover how to serve the Lord in their new circumstances. Editor’s note: Four community members have recently joined the group of missionaries living in Evansville replacing the four who have returned to college. The new missionaries are Peter Coleman Mary Grams Gianna Priolo and Jeanette Zimmel.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1083

945,Sept. 3 2010 9:13 a.m.,Near Campus in Indy the Community's Presence Grows,Fifty-four people gathered for a Lord's Day meal to open the school year. The community’s presence in the Triangle is rapidly increasing. The Triangle is a neighborhood adjacent to the joint campus of Indiana and Purdue University in Indianapolis (IUPUI). A seed planted there by three missionaries in the winter of 2007 is now a growing group of 18 including five freshmen majoring in biology nursing and philosophy. “Our goal is to provide a good place for students to go to college a place where they can study hard grow in the Lord and live in the community” says Walt Seale who leads the effort. Freshman Chris Walker a biology major on a premed track says the urban setting proximity to major hospitals and the chance to live in a household made IUPUI and life in the Triangle an attractive option for college. “Premed programs are very strong at IUPUI but the biggest draw for me was common life in household the Indianapolis branch and the chance to go to school with a purpose: learning skills to build the kingdom of God.

Matt and Mary Beth Harris (northern Virginia) have announced their plans to move to the Triangle with their daughter Claire provided that Matt a construction manager can find a job in the area. The growth has created a housing crunch. One household of ten women is shoehorned into a four-bedroom house with two bathrooms and two refrigerators.Patricia Brewer who leads the women’s household remembers starting out in 2008. “There was always room for guests always a place to pray and the bathroom was pretty much always open.” This year the women share bunks and desks and it’s rare to find an empty room.On August 21 parents and other friends joined the students to open the Lord’s Day and kick off the year. The group of 54 people included four men from Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana who frequently make the hourlong trek to the Triangle for Lord’s Day meals and other gatherings.  A household of 10 women is shoehorned into this four bedroom house. Community members living in the Indianapolis Triangle are members of the campus division of the South Bend branch. The community also has a campus division in Servant Branch for students at the University of Minnesota.***Living in the Triangle: Isaac Bolduc Patricia Brewer Meghan Couch Andrea Delee Emily Feeks Jared Gonzalez David Gruber George Kane Laura Kane J-T Kelly Jacquelyn Magill Anne Putzier Amy Rice Irene Robinson Walt and Pam Seale Chris Walker.

727,July 29 2010 9:14 p.m.,Dick Berg,"by Tom Beckley A long-time covenanted brother in Servant Branch Dick Berg of Edina Minnesota went to be with his Lord on December 9 2009 at the age of 70. We all join in our heartfelt prayers for his wife Jackie and their family at this time of loss. Dick was born in Sauk Center Minnesota on July 18 1939 the youngest of six children. He joined the Navy soon after high school and spent 21 years traveling the globe but never setting foot on a ship. To the great disappointment of family and friends Dick would never discuss his activities in the Navy because of his sensitive position in protecting the citizens of the United States and the security of US forces around the world. He’d made a promise not to talk about his work and he kept that promise. Even when the trusted members of his men's group would try to pry stories out of him he remained faithful to his word not to divulge any secrets. When Dick retired from the Navy he was looking for a place to live so Jim and Evelyn Bittner Dick's brother-in-law and sister welcomed him into their household. Jackie Thompson a single mother raising three children was also sharing household life with the Bittners at the time; she and the Bittners belonged to the Servants of the Light communitywhich later became the Servant Branch of the People of Praise. She had been involved in prayer meetings since the early days of the charismatic renewal in the Twin Cities but Dick was not that familiar with community life. Dick and Jackie used to go on long walks together so they could talk (there were a lot of people in the house). It was on those walks that Dick learned more about community (and about Jackie). He told her that ""maybe he should look into joining community."" Dick and Jackie also both prayed hard about becoming a blended family (they each had children from a previous marraige). He and Jackie were married March 7 1980 and for the next 30 years their partnership grew and flourished. Dick made the covenant January 27 1985. He was always faithful to his weekly men's group meetings community and area meetings and service team projects. Dick had a lifelong affinity for the arts. He did beautiful things with ceramics designed gardens and had a special love of photography. He and Jackie attended many theatrical events and classical music concerts. With his keen photographic eye Dick volunteered a lot of time to document the various cultures on display at the Festival of Nations celebration in St. Paul. In his last years even as Alzheimer’s robbed him of the words he desired to share at his weekly men's group meeting he could still come up with all the words to the songs and hymns we sang. Aging with gentleness and great love “Pop” Berg embraced and drew in both his own and Jackie's children as well as their ever-growing number of grandkids. Dick and grandson Kenny had a special connection. A few months after Dick’s death Kenny a special needs teen placed dandelions in Minnehaha Creek to send on their way to Pop “because I miss him so much in my heart.” His daughter Lisa always felt embraced by his love. “Dad looked at life with a different eye than most of us. He showed me that life was a gift and there was always something great around the corner.” Dick and Jackie loved to travel and they often included other family members on their journeys. Hawaii was Dick's favorite place to visit. Son-in-law Dale recounts how on a trip he took to Hawaii with Dick and Jackie not a single day passed without Dick contentedly sharing his favorite phrase “just another day in paradise.” His second career after the Navy was in the retirement branch of the U.S. Postal Service. Dick's work involved the human resource procedures of processing the information for retirees and helping them understand and gain access to all their postal retirement benefits. At the celebration for his own retirement from the Postal Service Dick was asked to answer a few questions about himself. One of the questions was “If you had 30 minutes to talk with anyone in history who would it be?” “My father. Only this time I would listen.” Dick was also asked “What’s the best time of your life?” He said “Today. Right now.” We thank God for the life and love of Dick Berg our brother in the People of Praise. He is buried at Ft. Snelling National Cemetery.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=727
750,July 29 2010 9:13 p.m.,Gail Lee,By Mary Lee Snow covered the quiet cemetery as Gail Lee’s family gathered on December 30 2009 to pray and celebrate her life on what would have been her 64th birthday. The snow reminded us of her youthfulness. If she had still been with us she would have been frolicking in the snow with her grandchildren making snow angels and snowmen. When I became engaged to Gail’s son John a dear friend of mine who had known John’s parents for years told me “Mary Carmen and Gail are just the salt of the earth.” It didn’t take me long to learn what that meant. They knew how to live in a way that made life just taste better to everyone around them.  Gail met the boy who was to become the love of her life when she was five years old. (Carmen was four at the time.) The relationship got off to a somewhat rocky start when Carmen signed Gail’s grade-school autograph book with a boyish taunt. Gail didn’t take that too much to heart and by the end of high school she was very much in love with him. They were married right after Gail finished her undergraduate degree and they moved to a dormitory of the North Dakota School for the Deaf where Carmen began as a teacher and later assumed the directorship. Soon their family began to grow with the births of John Travis and Aaron. In the early 1970s when charismatic renewal was sweeping across the Catholic Church in the U.S. Gail was touched in a new way by this wave of the Holy Spirit. She began attending prayer meetings and asked Carmen to join her. They soon felt the call to Christian community and moved to the Twin Cities to join Servants of the Light a community which later became the Servant Branch of the People of Praise. This was a sacrifice for both (it was a downward career move for him and Gail had to leave behind her enormous abundant garden) but they both knew it was what God wanted. They plunged into life in community. Gail once shared with me that community life had greatly improved their marriage and their relationship as a couple bore much fruit for the community. They made the covenant of the People of Praise on January 27 1985. Gail sometimes came across as a quiet woman but the women in her area and women’s group knew her strength. During the years that Carmen served as a coordinator she freed him to serve by making sure their home life was working well. She was a sister and friend to the women who lived in household with them and she did untold hours of work every summer preparing for Servant Camp (which Carmen led): organizing fundraising events arranging tent-mates preparing medical forms and much more. Even beyond her love for community Gail was devoted to her four children. She went to many of her kids’ soccer games in both high school and college. For years Gail trudged through the winter snow with Carmen and the boys on their morning paper route which helped pay for sports and education fees. When their daughter Cynthia was in grade school Gail took on work at a nearby dance studio so that Cynthia could attend lessons there and spent hours selling Girl Scout cookies and organizing a garage sale to raise money for Cynthia’s People of Praise Girl Scout troop to visit the branch in Hawaii. Gail was willing to sacrifice so that her family and others would not have to do without. For her people and relationships came first. Her sacrifices for others didn’t end when she found out that the cancer she'd beaten several years before came back in 2009. Gail and Carmen made a firm decision not to live or act as if she had a terminal illness. They continued to live as normally as they could spending Thursdays with their grandchildren and watching my kids every day at our house while I taught a class at Trinity School. Gail continued making monster cookies for her grandkids went to her oldest grandson’s soccer games and helped her daughter deliver her sixth grandchild only a month before she died. In fact if you had called their house last summer you might not have known that anything was different because as Gail always put it they were “deep into camp” which meant they were working on Servant camp from the time they woke up pretty much till the time they went to bed. On September 14 the day she died Gail’s breathing was very labored. As I watched her gasping for breath I thought of Jesus who also had poured out his life in love for us. Even her posture reminded me of Jesus on the cross. As Gail mirrored him in her life so she mirrored him in her death.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=750
779,July 29 2010 9:10 p.m.,Dave Temeles,By Bill Crimmins Editor’s note: Dave Temeles father grandfather and beloved husband brother and friend was a founding member of the northern Virginia Branch of the People of Praise where he served for many years as a coordinator teacher and head. Dave was born September 5 1938 and died July 21 2009.  “For a long time my dad was searching for the truth reaching out to God but confused” says David Temeles Jr. He is speaking at the wake service for his father David Abram Temeles. “Born to a Jewish father and a Christian mother in the late ‘30s my Dad was raised in a secular household. As an adult he was reluctant to choose a faith not wanting to insult the heritage of either parent but one Sunday he could no longer put off a choice. He was faced with the recalcitrance of an uppity six-year-old who refused to go into the church objecting ‘Why should I have to be a Catholic if you’re not?’ Dad realized that indecision was no longer acceptable. Turning to the Lord for an answer he had a vision-- the faces of countless holocaust victims who seemed to be saying ‘How can you reconcile our suffering with faith in God? How is it possible? Where was he then?’ And then the Lord’s face was among them asking my father ‘Will you trust me?’ My father decided then and there that he would trust the Lord and the rest of his life was witness to that trust.” David Jr. wraps up his sharing and there are many others waiting to take their turn. Charlie Fraga a friend and brother who has flown in from Portland wades through the crowd and steps to the microphone. It is a typical sultry mid-Atlantic summer evening. The hall at Murphy’s Funeral Home is crowded the air-conditioner’s capacity to cool the air has been overwhelmed and warm moist air blows around the room. There are not enough places to sit. Adults stand and watch listening shifting their weight from foot to foot. Even the kids who would normally be running up and down in the hallway outside are still subdued by the temperature and the closeness of the air. People are tired. But in spite of their discomfort they stay because they have come to see and hear and to remind themselves. They stand and perspire fanning themselves. They listen and watch. They are children friends children of friends former household members brothers and sisters who lived life in common with Dave in the northern Virginia branch of the People of Praise indeed who would not have had a People of Praise branch to share life in had it not been for Dave’s efforts in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s to find Christian community. Charlie says “Without Dave the People of Praise would not be what it is today in the D.C. area. I will go even further: There would not be the People of Praise here today were it not for Dave Temeles. Dave (with his wife Kathy of course) had an absolute passion for Christian community. A loose network of Christian relationships was not enough a prayer group was not enough a strong evangelistic outreach was not enough. He wanted full-blown Christian community life and he would not settle for anything short of that. . . . ” Charlie rejoins the crowd and our minds wander a bit in the blur of heat but the next sharing is another fond memory which reels the attention back. Jenny Nolan recalls the hospitality that was one of the defining characteristics of the Temeles home as she recounts what it was that drew her to live in household for three years with Dave Kathy and their daughter Jessica: “In those days their house was swirling with young adults and their dinner table was the place to be. The food was great and the conversation ran deep and it was often very lively. I don’t remember that Dave spoke all that much but when he did everyone wanted to hear what he was saying. . . . He was a good man but hard to describe because he didn’t take up a lot of space. He didn’t fill up the room with his presence. Instead he had this very very deep reserve of calm. It was incredibly attractive. If you were in his corner of the room you wanted to hang on his every word. Oh he was warm and he was funny and he was not the slightest bit opposed to teasing me or anybody else. . . .” Jenny is right. Dave was a gentle humble man. I know this well because just as he was for many other brothers in the branch over the years Dave was my patient concerned sympathetic wise and attentive loving and nonjudgmental head for several years. It is my turn at the microphone and I tell the crowd “Dave had a way about him a gift. I would always come away from a talk with Dave a little less frazzled a little more intact a little more hopeful a bit of my life’s tension defused. Coming out the front door of his home and walking across Jackson Street my step would be a little lighter. Sitting down into the driver’s seat of my car and heading home I’d be a little more confident about facing the challenges of a life filled at times to overflowing. Idling and waiting for the light at Marshall and Lee Highway I’d laugh again thinking about the laughter that had punctuated our conversation and feel more confidence about the curious challenges of riding herd over the complex relationships of a full and busy household. . . .” Back in the crowd I take off my jacket roll up my sleeves and loosen my tie as Therese McNichol shares about Dave’s faith and praying with her friend for healing. “During the time he battled cancer Dave experienced many healings that many of you probably never heard about. On at least three occasions that I can remember he came very close to going on dialysis but after we all prayed his lab results would come back normal and it wasn’t necessary. He was also healed of tumors and pain and his blood sugars came under control. Recently Tom and I prayed with him because he was having a lot of pain in his back and the pain never returned. And there were many other healings that he experienced over time. I used to suggest to him that he write them all down so others could be encouraged by the power of God. It was because of our prayers all of us here that Dave experienced so many healings. Ongoing prayers for healing do make a difference and should be a regular part of our lives. And I think that’s what our Father wanted us to know. . . .” Much more than this is said and it is all good. The evening is winding down as Quentin Horneman steps to the front of the room and begins to talk of Dave’s long-suffering nature and his friendship. Dave died of complications from renal cancer and was increasingly homebound the last years of his life so “. . . he really enjoyed it when people stopped to visit. I loved to go by and visit with my bighearted friend. He always acted like he was happy to see me he let me tussle his hair tell him I loved him and then he would tease with me in his good-natured way. He was never negative or grumpy. He didn’t complain. He lived to enjoy his people and I am so glad I was one of the people he knew and loved. I will miss my friend. . . .” The microphone is quiet. People begin to file out. They say their good-nights to Kathy and Jessica Melissa and David Jr. to Maggie and Michael and the grandkids. Yes we will all miss him Quentin. We will all miss him. Until we can be with him again.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=779
759,July 29 2010 9:07 p.m.,Paul Korkowski,By Jerry Wind Servant Branch gathered October 19 2009 with the Korkowski and Seeger families to honor the memory of a beloved brother nephew and friend Paul Korkowski who died tragically in a car accident on October 14. Paul was a faith-filled generous and intelligent brother in the Lord. We miss him and will remember him for his deep love of family and his dedication to life in the People of Praise. Often Paul had a twinkle in his eye. Usually rather quiet in a group he still gave you the impression that he had a better grasp of what was happening than he let on. His gentle smile indicated that he’d definitely have something to say if prodded and you would learn a lot if you listened to what it was. The shock of his sudden death was tempered by our celebration of his heroic and loving life. Paul was born August 23 1962 the fifth of five children and his father died when Paul was just two weeks old. His mother eventually moved the family from St. Paul to the home of her brother and sister-in-law the Seegers on a farm near Hastings Minnesota. The Korkowskis and Seegers became a blended family of 12 children including his seven Seeger cousins. Paul was in the fifth grade then and still the youngest. He loved soccer and adventurous walks down to the Mississippi River. There the kids swung on vines across the gullies and uncovered fossils in the dirt. The family grew their own sweet corn each summer and sold it at a vegetable stand with Paul usually filling the role of banker. Through the hard work and the horseplay of a joy-filled farm life Paul came to cherish his four siblings and all his cousins. They were one big family. This love and acceptance that he received and gave came to define Paul. Paul attended Hastings High School and Tom Caneff clearly remembers inviting him to the Life in the Spirit Seminars and praying over him to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. It was a memorable event for Tom; he was struck by young Paul’s sincerity and purity of heart. Paul attended the College of St. Thomas and then graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Ph.D. in organic chemistry. When talking chemistry this quiet reserved man could easily and comfortably speak to a group of 100 people. John Zimmel a friend of Paul’s and a member of his men’s group who was also a chemist recalls how he and Paul would sit at a Bruegger’s bagel shop discussing things like urethane catalysts and drawing chemical structures on napkins. Paul had a good memory and a sharp mind. He worked at 3M for 13 years and more recently at a veterinary pharmacy in St. Peter Minnesota where his nickname was “Doc.” Despite working about 70 miles from the Twin Cities in recent years Paul kept his condo in St. Paul so he could attend Servant Branch meetings and activities. He would also see family and friends and connect with his men’s group on the weekends. The effort he made to stay connected exemplified Paul’s committed life. His sister Kathy Korkowski (Servant Branch) says she will miss him coming to her house for weekend dinners. Also she and Paul often drove together to visit the Korkowski relatives whom they hadn’t seen very often while growing up which helped them all to became closer as adults. Phil Korkowski (Servant Branch) Paul’s only brother recalls fishing canoeing and camping together. One time camping at Leech Lake they were trying to sleep in their tent and thought they heard a lawnmower outside. No it was the sound of the “Minnesota state bird” mosquitoes. Phil fondly recalls their mutual amazement with a good laugh. Paul loved portaging through the Boundary Waters in northern Minnesota and also regularly went to rented lake cabins for long weekends and family vacations. This past June found him halibut fishing in Alaska with a high-school friend. Paul played an important role in the lives of many different people. At one point he owned a large house so he provided a gathering place for the Seeger and Korkowski clans. He never missed a family function. His niece Emily remembers Paul’s kindnesses to her: “When my parents couldn’t he helped pay for my braces and orthodontic work. One Christmas he gave me an old car and on my first wedding anniversary he gave me a card that said ‘Hey Emily do you know the difference between a light bulb and a niece? A light bulb can be replaced.’” No one can replace Paul for his family or his brothers and sisters in the People of Praise. His sister Rose stated that Paul had a heart of gold and lived his life following in the footsteps of Jesus. We commend our brother Paul this generous intelligent thoughtful faithful man to the Lord who always loved him.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=759
766,July 29 2010 9:03 p.m.,Bonnie Klein,By Colin Lavergne Bonnie Knott was born December 19 1950 in Red Lake Falls MN the sixth of 11 children. She grew up on the family farm and her chores usually involved cooking alongside her mom. She remembered the fun of making tunnels in the huge winter snowdrifts. She was a member of Lake Pleasant 4H Club and enjoyed plants and gardening throughout her life. She was also a protective older sister keeping an eye on her younger sisters at dances. When her sister Paulette was an early teen Bonnie spent extra time with her telling her how important a relationship with Jesus was. Bonnie attended Moorhead State University and was working for Hewlett-Packard when she joined the community. Later when Ken Larsen (Servant Branch) was starting a dental business with other community members he asked her if she would be willing to work for him as an office administrator. She courageously said yes leaving the security at her old job to work more closely with brothers and sisters. When Bonnie joined the community she moved into Bill and Adella Wacker's household in St. Paul. She was quite attached to her blue Camaro and the Lord helped her overcome that attachment as she responded to the needs of the other household members to borrow it. Soon she was leading a women's group of other singles. Bonnie sometimes had a mischievous sense of humor. One time when her mom and dad came to visit her she told her dad she had made a special sponge cake for him. (She had taken actual sponges cut them into cake size and then covered them with frosting.) She laughed hard as her dad tried unsuccessfully to cut the cake and then graciously replaced it with a real one. Joe and Bonnie Klein were married on January 2 1981 and soon started a family. She loved her kids passionately and was always involved in their lives. All three of her kids were avid soccer players and she was the ultimate soccer mom. She took them to numerous tournaments and did the bookkeeping for one of their soccer leagues. She always spoke proudly about all of them and about their accomplishments. Bonnie started her own daycare business at the same time she was starting her family and ran it for 16 years. After she closed the daycare she worked for the University of Minnesota Computer Science Department. Bonnie’s heart always went out to people in need. She taught her children to pray for people whenever they heard the sirens of emergency vehicles. She held strong beliefs about prolife issues and even had a dream of opening a home for unwed mothers. She was always interested in world events and liked to discuss big issues. She loved to celebrate birthdays with her women's group especially if they went out to eat. In early 2008 Bonnie was diagnosed with a stage-four brain tumor. She went through surgery radiation chemotherapy and hyperbaric chamber treatments while her husband children brothers and sisters co-workers and People of Praise members rallied around her. She kept up her sense of humor even as the effects of the cancer were robbing her more and more of her capabilities. One result of the cancer was a deepening of the romance between Joe and Bonnie. She often commented that she had never felt so much in love and loved as she did in the last couple of years. During one women's group meeting at her house Bonnie wryly noted “Some guy keeps giving me roses and telling me that he loves me.” When the women teased her about having “a secret admirer” from the next room Joe called out “There's no secret about it!” She was very adept at finances and had developed a unique system of managing their household finances. As the cancer progressed it was hard for Bonnie to see her abilities decline because she had been so very competent for so long. One of the women in her women's group recalls the only time she saw Bonnie angry about the cancer was when she was thinking about not being able to share in the lives of her kids and grandkids. Our Father welcomed Bonnie into his loving arms early in the morning on October 30 2009. She was surrounded by family her parish priest and several community friends.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=766
790,July 29 2010 9 p.m.,Gen Ficker,By Elizabeth Kaiser Genevieve Ficker of Hastings MN passed away peacefully on October 30 at the age of 90. She was born February 22 1919 in Nicollet MN. She and Albert Ficker (who died in 1974) were married in 1945 in Hampton MN where Gen started her 40-year career as a beautician. After they moved to Hastings she owned and operated Gen’s Beauty Shop on Fifth Street. I met Gen 20 years ago and immediately enjoyed her company and her stories and singing the songs we both knew. She was a frequent guest at our home for meals and celebrations and we joined with Gen’s family to celebrate her birthdays as she neared 90. When our sons were little Gen would entertain them while I prepared lunch after a morning’s outing of garage sales. She shared gardening ideas and taught me how to prepare applesauce her way which we like much better than the store-bought kind. She was patient and didn’t scold when the boys wielded their knives Rambo-style chopping the apples that we cooked and canned. I have thanked the Lord many times for sending Grandma Gen to us because Ed and I both have families who live out of state. Gen’s faith continues to inspire me. One of Gen’s six children Pat along with his wife Patricia and four of Gen’s grandchildren Laura Dan Lisa and Catherine are members of the People of Praise. Gen came underway October 23 1983 in Servant Branch after she retired. She was an avid card player cook gardener and seamstress and she loved to crochet. One day Gen was talking to a social worker at Regina Assisted Living where she spent her last few years. She told stories about the many 12-hour days she had worked in the beauty shop and how much she enjoyed those years. The social worker listened to Gen for over an hour. Gen had so many great stories--stories that brought us to laughter and sometimes to the point of tears. She had a wonderful sense of humor. Her response to Bernadette Fossen’s greeting “Hi Gen! How are you?” was “I’m still alive but I can’t run as fast.” When Gen visited the Fossens she didn’t arrive empty-handed. She’d say “Hey! I just picked some raspberries from a friend’s place. Here you go.” Gen then sat on a chair in the kitchen and Bernadette would hand her a baby to hold while they talked or while Grandma Gen shared her recipes . . . homemade pie crust or rhubarb sauce. They laughed over Gen’s stories. Bernadette remembers one of the scariest: Gen was driving a streetcar in St. Paul while studying to become a beautician. “One evening very late a man boarded the streetcar and said ‘It’s a good night for a murder.’ Gen put on a brave front and yelled at him to get to the back . . . but in reality she was scared stiff!” John Fasbender attended grade school with Pat and admits to being a frequent visitor at the Ficker home. John and Pat were Minnesota Twins fans from a young age and Gen would graciously drive them and their friends to ballgames in her convertible. He remembers that Gen was able to corral their exuberance and excitement and patiently not lose her cool. John credits her prayers for their eventual coming to Christ years later. Gen’s patience and faith had its impact on them and on others. Gen persevered in faith as she faced the physical limitations of old age such as decline in vision lack of mobility and arthritis. She told Pat “Jesus will lead me home; you can count on that Pat.” Just a week before she died when a nurse asked if she wanted to see the doctor about a wound on her leg that wouldn’t heal Gen replied “No it is time to see Jesus.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=790
659,July 22 2010 10:07 p.m.,A House Moves in Indianapolis,July 14 2010 Indianapolis—The Indianapolis Triangle house formerly located at 1435 Montcalm Street was moved to its new location at 1450 Rembrandt Street. A campus division women's household lived in the house since last fall. They moved in after two years of major renovations performed largely by visiting Action teams. In late 2009 a commercial developer offered to buy the property as part of an initiative to build student housing near the IUPUI campus. After negotiations with the People of Praise the developer agreed to cover the cost of relocating the house about a block away across the street from Walt and Pam Seale's home. The women's household is planning to move back into their home—with a new address and a new basement—before the school year begins.

636,June 18 2010 3:10 p.m.,The Grapevine Delivers . . . Tomatoes.,By Sean Connolly      The Triangle area of Indianapolis wanted fresh vegetables so this spring Jenny Sergio and Trish Brewer planted a garden—several varieties of tomatoes and peppers in five neat rows behind the duplex. But one Sunday morning in late May Jenny awoke to discover that that their plants had gone missing. “There were just holes left in the garden” Trish remembers. Walt Seale mentioned the purloined plants to Walter an older neighbor who mows lawns and knows about neighborhood goings-on. “Neighbors just don’t do that” Walt told him. “We don’t steal one another’s tomato plants.” Later that afternoon Walter came to Walt and mumbled a cryptic message: “Walk down the alley and take a look down there on the left.” Walt followed the alley behind the duplex but saw no plants. A few days later on Wednesday as Trish walked from her car to the duplex another neighbor rode up on his mountain bike. A single full beer can dangled from either side of the handlebars attached there by two six-pack rings. “I heard about your tomato plants” he said. “That’s terrible. I don’t like that at all. I’ve got some plants I want to give you.” “Really? That’s very generous of you” Trish said. The man returned with a plastic pot containing three young tomato plants. “I don’t want this kind of thing happening in this neighborhood” he told her. “We’re all friends here. We don’t want this to be the kind of place where people do that.” “It sounded exactly like what Walt had told Walter” Trish remembers. She thought the plants looked familiar but she couldn’t be sure. In any case the Triangle now has a bigger garden than before the heist thanks to the three tomato plants and some more vegetable plants donated by an Indianapolis branch member. “We added a whole extra row to the garden” Trish says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=636

597,June 3 2010 10:07 p.m.,In Kingston Feeding the Hungry As Violence Erupts,Branch members prepare food for distribution to Kingston's homeless population. Photo courtesy of Kevin Rodriguez.  Kingston Jamaica. Photo credit: Kevin Rodriguez. By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly A violent crisis disrupted life in Kingston Jamaica last week as local gangs and government forces clashed. The fighting began after police launched a manhunt for Christopher Coke a gang leader wanted on gun and drug trafficking charges in the United States. Seventy civilians are reported dead amid rumors of aggressive police tactics and a trail of corruption that allegedly leads to the country’s Prime Minister Bruce Golding according to multiple news reports. The government declared a state of emergency and has restricted some civil liberties. The day the conflict boiled over Sunday May 23 members of the Kingston branch came unwittingly close to the fighting. Branch members delivering meals to residents near the Tivoli Gardens neighborhood encountered barricades and saw black smoke rising from a burning police station. “We knew there was a risk of trouble when we set out to deliver food but we saw other cars driving into the area so we decided to go ahead” explains Joseph Mutidjo a member of the feeding team. “Demand for food was heavier than usual because other feeding groups stayed away. “Later that day a gun battle took place on the same street we had been on. The Lord definitely protected our feeding team.” The team handed out 320 meals that Sunday. As the violence spread schools closed and many businesses shut their doors. The branch canceled men’s and women’s group meetings and members did their best to stay home. Locksley Robinson nearly drove into a gunfight on his way home from work but police stopped him and sent him another way.All branch members are safe and unharmed. The fighting has subsided this week though the state of emergency remains in force and Christopher Coke is still on the run. “It’s a tragic situation” says head branch leader Vince Keaveny “the worst I’ve ever seen.” “We tried to keep a low profile last week” adds Joseph. “Rumors were flying everywhere and the situation was fluid and confusing. Please pray for us and pray that we can figure out how to continue delivering food to the people who need it.” Editor’s Note: Kingston branch member Sam Davis submitted this first person account of the effort to feed Kingston's homeless on Sunday May 23. Feeding His Lambs in the Lion’s DenBy Sam Davis Despite the rising tension and concerns for the safety of our teams we decided that our feeding ministry must go on.  We did not realize that God had already set in motion a plan that would not only grant safe passage for his servants but would deliver more meals than we had ever delivered to the homeless and poor. The first sign that this was going to be an extraordinary day came when we met to prepare our food.  When the pots we’d used to cook the food were empty we had packaged a record 320 meals! (We normally distribute 250 meals.) We held hands in a circle and prayed that God would provide a special cloak of security for us and that he would lead us to the 320 brothers and sisters most in need. We worried that many of the homeless would not be in their usual spots and that there would be meals left over. Nevertheless we set out on Kingston’s emptier-than-usual streets in search of the hungry. In downtown Kingston we were happy to see familiar faces emerge to greet our vehicle.  The homeless formed a line said grace and collected their meals against the backdrop of black smoke from a building set on fire less than two miles away. “We haven’t seen the others [from other feeding programs]” one lamented as he requested a second meal to have later in the evening.  Suddenly the purpose of the additional meals became clear.  With the civil unrest there was no guarantee of when and where the next meal would come from. Many received a second meal until they all were gone! Soon after we left the government declared a state of public emergency and sealed off the downtown area.  From television we learned that there were gunfights that day on the very streets on which we stood handing out meals. That day reminded us that if we are willing and obedient our God is faithful and we need not fear any ill.  We now eagerly look forward to our next feeding program!,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=597
576,June 1 2010 5:05 p.m.,Hip Healed After Word of Knowledge,Lisa Ficker  Ann Thomas By Chris Meehan Hip pain woke Ann Thomas (South Bend) at 3:00 a.m. on Sunday May 2 and kept her awake until daylight. Her right hip has troubled her for years—an orthopedic surgeon and X-rays confirm a diagnosis of arthritis a condition aggravated by bearing nine children and by chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Just after 3:00 p.m. that day when Ann stood for the first song at the branch community meeting her hip was still throbbing. She knew she would have to change positions often to manage the pain. Lisa Ficker was standing near Ann at the front of the same section of chairs. A few weeks before at a gathering of branch women the Lord had given Lisa a word of knowledge—he wanted to heal someone’s right hip. She’d never given a word in front of such a large group and she didn’t know that Ann had a hip condition. Lisa didn’t give the word at the women’s meeting but she thought of it often in the days that followed. She remembered how her own lower back pain had been healed when someone gave a word of knowledge at a branch community meeting. “As the May 2 meeting started” she says “I felt the Lord remind me of the word.” She walked over to the chairs by the microphone and soon delivered her short message “I think the Lord wants to heal someone’s right hip today.” Then Chris Rowland led the branch in a prayer for the healing. A few seconds later Ann felt the pain leave her hip. She shared about the healing later in the meeting. The next morning she spent two hours on her hands and knees gardening at a friend’s house without experiencing the throbbing pain. One month later the pain is still gone. In May Ann attended the graduations of two of her children the First Communion of a third and the wedding of her oldest son Ricky. “It was really merciful of the Father to heal my hip” she says.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=576
566,May 12 2010 5:13 p.m.,Tom Evans to Step Down as Coordinator for Southern Branches,Tom and Diane Evans. Credit: Angela Pingel By Chris Meehan Tom Evans the coordinator responsible for the Biloxi Mobile and Shreveport branches will step down from his position on July 1 2010. Diane Tom’s wife will also relinquish her handmaid-type responsibilities for these three branches. Mike Coney principal branch coordinator for New Orleans and a member of the community’s board of governors will assume Tom’s responsibilities. Linda Coney principal handmaid in New Orleans will take up Diane’s work relating to the women leaders of these three branches. Tom began serving as a mission coordinator in 1987. In 1988 he helped guide the St. Mary of the Pines prayer group in Shreveport through their decision to become a People of Praise mission branch. He and Diane have seen the Shreveport branch through the sudden deaths of two branch leaders Jim Minto and Pat O’Connor and through the changes that came with the birth of the community’s Allendale outreach in 2002. They helped the Biloxi and Mobile branches recover after Hurricane Katrina scattered members and destroyed homes in 2005. From 1987 to 1999 Tom served as principal branch coordinator for New Orleans. “Tom has been a fine pastoral leader good at moving people forward and he performed brilliantly in a number of difficult situations with his calm and steady presence” says Kevin Ranaghan head of the branch relations team on which Tom and Diane serve. “And Diane excels in one-on-one pastoral work.” Cliff Vaughan Shreveport’s head branch leader agrees: “I’m so grateful to Tom. He’s continually formed us through weekly phone calls and personal visits two three or four times a year—whatever was necessary. Tom always has the right words to say. He knows the Lord and he knows the People of Praise and that’s a great combination. Tom and Diane have been so generous with their time their wisdom and their sense of humor. Just ask Diane about the rubber cockroaches that sometimes appear in funny places after their visits.” The Shreveport branch honored Tom and Diane at a Lord’s Day meal during their branch visit in April. Debbie Vaughan said “When I spend time with Diane I experience being formed in the community’s ways. For example Diane doesn’t just know the community’s teaching on right speech. She has the heart of the Lord his love for the people she talks about so of course she speaks rightly about them. I also admire Tom’s integrity. What he believes is what he says what he says is what he lives. There’s a wholeness about him.” At 72 Tom says he’ll manage to stay busy compliments of Diane’s To-Do-When-Retired List. They also hope to visit branches they’ve never been to. Tom and Diane have two grown sons. Craig Lent had this to say about the Coneys: “Mike’s extensive pastoral experience and Linda’s years as principal handmaid for her branch make them well-qualified for this work. Mike recently retired from Shell Oil. They’re a wonderful couple with a great family—they’ll do a super job.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=566
382,April 29 2010 2:34 a.m.,A Grief Softened in Saskatoon,"By Chris Meehan Three women sat on portable stools among the gravestones laughing and crying as they watched the rays of the evening sun stream through the trees. “You might say it was my great sorrow that brought us there but I’d say it was really the love of my sisters in Christ” explains Judy Hickey (Saskatoon). Judy’s mother died 44 years ago when Judy was eight years old. Following the custom of the time Judy and her sister had not been allowed to attend their mother’s funeral services. The pain and anguish from losing her mom grew over the years but Judy didn’t talk about it very much. Then she brought up her grief at a women’s group meeting. “Judy have you ever been to your mother’s grave?” Janice Akerman asked after hearing the story. “No. I’m afraid it’ll be too hard. And I don’t even know where she’s buried.” “We’ll find out. We’ll come and get you next Monday for women’s group and we’ll go with you if that’s what you need” Janice said. The next Monday evening Suzanne Rooke and Janice rolled up to Judy’s house in Janice’s car. They drove 20 minutes to a large cemetery. Janice found the grave’s location online and printed a map so Judy could find the spot then and in the future. Janice and Suzanne brought flowers for Judy to place on her mother’s grave. As they sat in the warm sun Judy shared memories of her mother the things she missed the most and how her mother’s death had affected her life over the years. ""As we talked and cried together” says Judy “I realized how grateful I was for these women and for the time and effort we had put into our friendship over the years to bring us to this point. They were God’s provision for me. I found that I could start to face my grief and move along with it once I had the strength and courage of my women’s group to bolster me. I wouldn’t have wanted to face it on my own.”",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=382
380,April 29 2010 2:29 a.m.,On the Indy South Side Seeds of Community Life,From left: CIM team members David Zimmel and Nick Raway.   By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly A new team of 10 people is carrying forward our city-building work on the South Side of Indianapolis: leading prayer meetings running men’s and women’s groups visiting neighbors renovating South Side homes and prepping for a wave of summer Action teams. Signs of community life are plentiful: •    10 to 20 neighbors attend the weekly Sunday evening prayer meeting. •    Two men’s groups and two women’s groups meet weekly. •    Five South Side neighbors—three men and two women—are underway in the new start. •    The community and community members have acquired eight houses including seven located on  two adjacent blocks. The members of the  team are now part of Christians in Mission (CIM) a recently reestablished unit of the Mission program office that will focus on building community in new start locations. Team members include experienced South Side residents missionaries transferred from other locations and members with long experience in branch life. (Note: Christians in Mission is distinct from the Missionary Company which sent a team to Evansville Indiana in February. The Missionary Company aims to make initial contact with neighbors in a new start locale. Both are units of the Mission program office headed by program coordinator Nick Holovaty.)  Members of the CIM single women's household take in a baseball game. From left: Angie Hass Cathy Feehly Naomi Caneff and Melissa Rader.   Mission coordinator David Zimmel is in charge of the South Side work. “For three years we’ve focused on meeting South Siders and talking with them about the Lord. Now our goal is to form the people we’ve met in Christian community life. Our objectives include teaching neighbors to celebrate the Lord’s Day to participate in a men’s or a women’s group to study and pray using the Christian Community Bible and to join in our weekly prayer meetings. “Since February our team has formed households and found work to support ourselves. We live in three households one for single men (Charles Chow Michael Coney Nick Raway David Zimmel) one for single women (Naomi Caneff Cathy Feehly Angie Hass Melissa Rader) and one married household (Ray and Robin Gonzalez). Most team members work full-time jobs; a few work part-time so they can free up hours for neighborhood work. Michael is overseeing renovations to two of the eight houses in the new start along with a number of improvement projects on the other properties.  Neighbor Larry “Gill” Gilliam has taken charge of renovating a bathroom in one of the homes. “He heard that we needed help so he started stopping by two or three times a week. He recently asked to come underway” David says. Four Action teams will also help with the renovation work this summer. “I’m looking forward to getting a lot of cleaning and renovation accomplished in the next few months” David adds. “It’s an exciting and busy transition time on the South Side.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=380

349,April 21 2010 1:21 a.m.,His Pain Healed A Neighbor Goes on Mission,By Chris Meehan     Evansville missionary Peter Putzier “I’ve got to sit down—I’m in so much pain” said Tim a 25-year-old man with a long white cloth wrapped around his rib cage. He had broken two ribs and torn some of the muscles in his right shoulder in a car accident. It hurt to breathe and he couldn’t stand up straight without pain. As Tim sat on his front porch Evansville missionaries Peter Putzier and Mary Timler started a conversation about the importance of hearing the Lord and responding quickly to what the Lord says. “I can tell that you both have a relationship with God” Tim said. “No offense but I wouldn’t have kept talking to you if I hadn’t seen that.” Five days earlier at church on Easter Sunday Tim had rededicated his life to the Lord. He claimed he could “talk your ear off about the Lord.” He also said that his rib cage hurt at an eight on a scale of one to ten but when Mary and Peter prayed with him he said the pain dropped to a two. “Can you take off the binder?” Peter asked him. Tim’s eyes widened as he removed the white cloth expecting a stab of pain at any moment. “I can’t believe this.” Tim began gingerly probing his ribs through his T-shirt but he couldn’t cause any pain to flare up. He looked at his friend James standing nearby. “You’ve seen me the whole time” Tim said. “I couldn’t take that thing off without grimacing before.” Tears welled up in his eyes. “Thank you God! Thank you God!” Peter suggested that Tim try singing which requires deep breathing. Tim easily joined in a chorus of “Our God Is an Awesome God” then he stood up straight and cried out “The pain is gone. I’m so glad you came over here today.” Peter asked Tim if he’d like to join them for missionary work the next day. Tim agreed and spent 90 minutes talking to neighbors and sharing the story of his healing. “At one point we ran into an old friend of his and Tim was excited to talk about the Lord with him even offering to pray with him” Peter says. When they started the day’s missionary work Tim’s abdominal binder lay in the same spot on his porch where he had dropped it the day before.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=349

320,April 12 2010 7:44 p.m.,New Chair of the Board of Trustees of Trinity Schools,"From the Board of Trustees Trinity Schools Inc.: It is with heartfelt regret that we announce the resignation of Paul C. DeCelles Chair of the Board of Trustees of Trinity Schools Inc. but we are delighted to announce the election of Craig S. Lent as the new Chair of the Board effective April 1 2010. Paul has been Chair since the founding of the first Trinity School in 1981.  Under his leadership we have grown from a small school of approximately 40 students holding class in a rented church facility to a student body of 700 students 3 campuses and approximately 150000 square feet of educational space.  During Paul's tenure all three Trinity Schools have won the prestigious blue ribbon award from US Department of Education.  Most importantly we've produced 1500 graduates who have excelled academically in the performing arts in civic leadership and in the service of the poor and needy. Paul's passion for learning and specifically for the unique education of Trinity Schools along with the vision which he brought to fruition over the past 29 years as Chair of the Board of Trustees is unsurpassed.  ""I will miss collaborating with all the leaders of the community of learners"" says Paul ""but I am especially grateful for my long association with Clem Walters Kevin Ranaghan and Kerry Koller who have been with me on the Board since the beginning.  I'm also grateful that Craig has accepted this position."" We will miss Paul but we support him in his decision to focus his efforts on the burgeoning mission business and communication activities of the People of Praise.  Please join us in thanking him for his many years of service to the mission of Trinity Schools and in praying for his continuing efforts to serve God and his people. Together with Paul we welcome Dr. Craig Lent as the new Chair of the Board.  Craig is well suited for this responsibility.  He is the Frank M. Freimann Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.  Although he is a new member of the Board Craig has been engaged with Trinity as a parent and as a consultant to our math curriculum reviews.  He is also responsible for the creation of  the brilliant Matlab course of instruction at Trinity and training its teachers. He and his wife Mary are the parents of two Trinity School at Greenlawn alumni.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=320
284,April 9 2010 1:36 a.m.,Action Trip Underway in Indianapolis,By Chris Meehan  From left: Andrew Kress (northern Virginia) Eddie Pingel (South Bend) and Sam Mertz (South Bend). Fourteen Action members are in Indianapolis this week repairing homes on the city’s South Side. Team members are mudding joints installing windows and doors adding support beams to a teetering garage and hauling away trash and debris. This trip includes four Action veterans—Don Ferber (Servant Branch) Chris and Geriann Raway (Servant Branch) and Sam Mertz (South Bend)—who have logged 29 trips to Allendale or Indianapolis among them. I asked them why they keep going back. “Working on these trips energizes me” says Don a retiree who has traveled 12 times to Allendale and Indianapolis since 2003. “It expands my sense of belonging to the community. I have friends throughout the branches that I’ve met from the trips.” Chris Raway (Servant Branch) is on his fifth Action trip. “I’m a handyman and I can apply my skills” he says. “It’s fun teaching them to brothers and sisters.”  Geriann Raway (Servant Branch)   “You don’t have to be Mr. Handyman to help on these trips” he adds. “It’s great if you can plumb install wiring or do carpentry but if you can’t there’s still plenty of work to do.” Work like driving the team from place to place preparing meals or traveling to the various Lowe’s and Home Depots around town and begging for discounted building materials. “The life experiences that adults bring to these trips are huge assets” adds Mike Coney (Indianapolis) who is managing this Action team’s work. “Just knowing what questions to ask about a job and when to ask them can make the difference between success and failure.” Jim Brickweg a junior at Trinity School at River Ridge says he’s grateful for the chance to improve his carpentry skills. “I spent most of this trip putting in doors which I didn’t know how to do before. I’ve been working with Chris—it’s been great getting to know him. I can tap into wells of wisdom I don't already have.”  The Action team has a prayer meeting.  A Request for More Action WorkersFrom Mike Zusi Action Program Coordinator Brothers and Sisters We need more workers on this summer’s Action trips to Allendale and Indianapolis. We need drivers. We need men and women with experience in construction and experience managing projects and people. We need cooks shoppers and people willing to beg for discounted and donated materials. The success of our Action teams depends on the volunteers who come on the trips to lead work crews teach skills and support the summer staff. Take a look at your summer schedule and pray about serving on an Action trip.  Then go to the Action page of the People of Praise website for information on trips and dates this summer. Thanks to everyone who has served on Action trips and thanks also for all your support of Action fundraising.  Your sacrifices are bearing great fruit.

206,April 1 2010 2:24 a.m.,In Buffalo A Word Casts Out Fear,By Chris Meehan The word of the Lord can change your life even if it comes in question form. “What would God have you do if you weren’t too afraid to do it?” asked Jeanne DeCelles (South Bend) speaking at the Buffalo branch women’s retreat in 2002. The question rattled around in Arlene Meyerhofer’s (Buffalo) mind. She suspected that the Lord was trying to tell her something. “Please Lord don’t be subtle!” she prayed. She didn’t have to wait long. “When I arrived home from the retreat” Arlene remembers “I found my fifth-grade daughter Pamela with a piece of paper in each hand. She had spent the weekend working on lists of reasons to be homeschooled and reasons to stay in school. As the tears welled up she said ‘Mommy see how much bigger the homeschool list is? I just want to learn! Won’t you please pray about homeschooling me?’” Arlene didn’t know anyone in her area who homeschooled and “the thought of taking responsibility for my child’s future like that terrified me!” But that question from the retreat helped her overcome these fears. She and her husband George talked things over and decided Arlene would begin teaching their daughter. Plenty of new possibilities flowed from the decision. Pamela did chores one day a week at a riding stable in exchange for horseback riding lessons. She had more time for violin lessons for Scottish country dancing art lessons and service projects too. Arlene also began homeschooling her son George who enjoyed it so much he passed up a scholarship to a nearby private high school to remain in home school. “I worried that my children would lack social confidence if I homeschooled them but Pamela recently spoke in front of seven different organizations” Arlene says. To top things off this spring Pamela was accepted into the honors program at Ohio’s Xavier University. “The decision to homeschool was a turning point for our family” Arlene says. “But without that word I would have been too afraid to undertake the task.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=206

194,April 1 2010 12:10 a.m.,Meadow View Seniors Harness Wind Energy,From left: John Piescik Joshua Kelly José Gil-Figueroa Benjamin Redgrave Christopher Cornett By Joe Gleason Five seniors from Trinity School at Meadow View spent their project week building a 14-foot-high windmill on the schoolgrounds. The idea emerged last November after physics teacher Tim Maloney told a story at morning prayer about a 14-year-old Malawian boy William Kamkwamba. William studied a physics textbook then built a windmill from recycled bicycle parts and other salvaged materials. After hearing the story seniors Chris Cornett Ben Redgrave José Gil-Figueroa Josh Kelly and Johnny Piescik approached Tim with the idea of building their own windmill during project week. They set to work on a written proposal that included diagrams materials and cost estimates as well as an operations manual explaining how each part of the windmill functioned in relation to the whole. “We wanted to treat this like it was an actual engineering project not just something hypothetical” Chris says. During project week they assembled the structure from lumber PVC pipe steel poles and wood paneling but their efforts to generate power to run a light bulb ran into some hiccups. Their original design called for an automotive alternator to channel the electrical current. After some experimenting they switched to a more efficient alternative: a bicycle dynamo they bought at a used bike shop. (It converts the energy from peddling into electricity for a bicycle headlight.) “It was wonderful to watch them do legitimate problem-solving in real time” Tim says. The windmill cost about $250 and succeeded in producing power. “The best part was when we got it working” Chris says. “We were really disappointed for a while but finally the windmill started powering the light bulb.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=194
199,April 1 2010 12:05 a.m.,First Blue Ribbon for Trinity School in Northern Virginia,By Catherine Bulger Trinity School at Meadow View has earned its first blue ribbon award from the US Department of Education. The 12-year-old school was one of only two private high schools in the country to receive the honor for 2009. The award is the sixth for a Trinity School campus. To qualify Meadow View students had to score in the top 10% nationally on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Tim Maloney a math and physics teacher assembled a 22-page application laying out the case that Meadow View was not just a “good school” or even a “strong school” but a “model exemplary school.” Tim and head of school Andrew Zwerneman accepted the award at a ceremony last November. The Blue Ribbon Award primarily recognizes academic achievement but at Meadow View learning is inseparable from a culture of camaraderie fun and joy in discovery. Meadow View has a small enrollment—130 students—and a humble campus: four small buildings with not a single room large enough to hold the entire faculty and student body. The large commons area does triple duty as lunchroom classroom and drama stage and the soccer field boasts mulch instead of grass. But students and faculty say the modest facilities and the school’s size are big advantages. “We maintain a level of friendship that you might not find in a bigger school” notes Andrew. “It’s the perfect size” adds senior Justin Young. “There’s a huge camaraderie among the classes.” For dean of girls Jenny Nolan a typical day at Meadow View begins as she unlocks the girls’ locker room greets the girls and heads off to morning prayer. “Morning prayer feels very personal” she says. “On Thursdays and Fridays senior girls help lead prayer. There are only three full-time women on the faculty—if we had to lead prayer ever day we’d be in big trouble!” The girls often pray for us—the teachers—in our presence.” Meadow View is the only Trinity School where morning prayer regularly involves chanting. “One or two days a week we actually sing the psalms like medieval monks” says senior Nathaniel Hlavin. “That’s a fun way to start the day.” The school has a charism for fun. For example in the quirky competition called Quest classes vie for points in a quiz bowl (called Metaphysical Pursuit) and a Ping-Pong tournament. The winning class gets their class year engraved on an oar that hangs in the school a symbol of “finality and triumph” Andrew Zwerneman explains. The oar is just like the paddle that the Greek hero Odysseus planted in the ground after completing his heroic quest described in Homer’s Odyssey. Meadow View has a serious side as well. When teacher Emily Heidel’s father had an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down parents brought meals for Emily’s family and students organized a chili cook-off raising $3600 to help with medical expenses. Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools says Meadow View’s teachers have helped shaped a culture where everyone feels free. “They have a first-rate faculty of terrific teachers who love Trinity School.” “People here care about what they’re learning” adds Nathaniel pointing to his experience studying ancient classics with Humane Letters Seminar teacher Ed Kelly: “It felt like we had just dug up Homer’s ancient manuscript. Millions of people had read it before but he made it seem totally new. When Trinity uses the term ‘community of learners’ they’re not lying.” It’s a community of learners that is also a community of psalm-chanters of-tug-of-war contestants of springtime outdoor barbecuers and of numerous athletes: 90% of the students play at least one sport. Of course learning is at the heart of things and now Meadow View has a national award to prove that a thriving culture housed in humble confines can get big results.,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=199

134,March 25 2010 2:54 p.m.,A Missionary First: Preaching in Song,Evansville Missionaries Peter Putzier and Catherine Ficker.  By Chris Meehan “I think the Lord wants us to praise the Lord and sing a song to them.” Catherine Ficker was talking to Peter Putzier as the two missionaries approached a one-story home in an older Evansville subdivision with neat lawns and sidewalks. The missionaries sing often in nursing homes and prayer meetings but they’d never sung unprompted on a front porch before. Earlier that afternoon as the missionaries gathered to pray someone had read a psalm about praising God. In Catherine’s mind the word about singing fit right in. A dark-haired woman of middle age opened the door and looked out at them through the screen. “I think the Lord wants us to sing for you” Peter said “and you’re welcome to join in.” The missionaries raised their hands and sang: “If you want to see the victory of the Lord why don’t you praise him lift up your hands and praise him?” The woman stood plain-faced but her kindergarten-aged daughter swayed and beamed with delight. She seemed to enjoy every note. “All right I have to go” the woman said as they finished the song. “Great” Peter said. “Praise God!” The woman closed the door. “That child got it” Peter said later. “Her appreciation of our song reminded me of what Jesus said about receiving the kingdom of God like a little child. “I’m sure God wanted us to sing that day. I would do it again if that’s what needed to be done.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=134

Her drivers Allendale missionaries Jeanette Zimmel and Cathy Grill saw a brownish circle about the size of a quarter on the back of her yellow uniform shirt—a dried stain from oily hair gel. As they approached the school Jeanette asked LaTanya if she wanted to pray for anything that morning. “Can we pray for the stain?” LaTanya asked. Jeanette and Cathy prayed three times. The stain didn’t disappear but they told LaTanya to keep asking God to remove the stain by the time her first class began. Later that day one of LaTanya’s friends told her that something seemed different about her appearance. She’d seen the stain earlier but it wasn’t there any more. LaTanya rushed to the bathroom to check the back of her shirt in the mirror. Her friend was right: no stain. The next day LaTanya told Cathy and Jeanette what happened. “You can be sure God loves you” Jeanette said. “He took that stain away.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=109

34,March 19 2010 2:15 a.m.,Missionary Work Expands to Evansville,By Sean Connolly Fourteen People of Praise missionaries moved from Indianapolis to Evansville Indiana on February 17. The move launched what we expect will be our third new start following Shreveport (2002) and Indianapolis (2007). Evansville a city of 120000 in the southwest corner of Indiana is the first mission location that is not already home to a People of Praise branch. Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty heads the Evansville team. In Indianapolis David Zimmel leads a team of 10 missionaries continuing our work on the South Side. “Our team is large enough and strong enough to split and work in two locations” Nick says. “We’ve been training new missionaries in Indianapolis for more than a year. Also Indianapolis branch members are now very involved in our South Side men’s and women’s groups.” Since February 17 Evansville missionaries have been knocking on doors around the city delivering words from the Lord praying with people and looking for those the Lord is calling to Christian community. A woman told the missionaries that she could only see white light out of one of her eyes. The missionaries prayed once and then she could see shadows. Remembering that Jesus prayed twice for a blind man (Mk. 8:25) they prayed again. Then she said she could see the missionaries clearly with her bad eye. A young man accepted the missionaries’ suggestion that they pause in their conversation so he could pray privately for five minutes. During prayer he heard Jesus tell him that he should give his life over to God. He got down on his knees and did it. A woman who couldn’t bend her knees because of pain knelt down on the ground in prayer after the missionaries prayed with her. Her pain was still gone a week later.“Missionary work is physically and mentally taxing and there are definitely moments of joy” Nick says. “Some of that joy comes when people dedicate their lives to the Lord and some of it comes when people laugh at us like they laughed at Jesus at Jairus’s house.” (Mk. 5:40). The missionaries rely on God to supply some of their basic needs. They eat and live simply. Working odd jobs one day a week is sufficient to cover the rest of their living expenses.The team lives in two adjacent rented houses half a mile from the University of Evansville. The manager of the houses gave them their first local job. After seeing how well they had cleaned the houses he offered them work cleaning and renovating his other properties.  “Before moving to Evansville we made preliminary trips to a number of cities including Memphis Louisville and Evansville” Nick says. “Lots of people in and around Evansville were willing to listen to us and they asked us to come back. We’re glad we did.” Evansville Missionaries: John BowarAnnie BulgerJoe BulgerAbby EarhartCatherine FickerRyan HardinNick HolovatyLiz LoughranRus LyonsClaire MysliwiecEllen ReedPeter PutzierMary TimlerChris Vieck,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=34

1,March 18 2010 3:04 p.m.,Banding Together So All May Believe,"John R. Mott a Methodist layman and pioneer of the ecumenical movement helped organize the World Missionary Conference and spread its informal motto ""the evangelization of the world in this generation."" CommentaryBy Sean Connolly At a February conference in Rome Catholic Cardinal Walter Kasper made a bold proposal to Anglican Lutheran Methodist and Reformed leaders: “an ecumenical catechism” a joint commentary on the Apostles Creed the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer. That was unthinkable 100 years ago when a group of Protestants met in Edinburgh Scotland for a conference credited with launching the ecumenical movement. The president of the conference read a telegram to the delegates from Anglican leaders containing a single prescient Scripture verse: John 17:21. Nowadays every place the word “ecumenism” goes John 17:21 follows: scrappy local prayer services papal encyclicals harangues over the scandal of a divided Christianity. It’s ecumenism’s ubiquitous theme—Jesus’ prayer to his Father—usually shortened slightly: “that they may all be one . . . so that the world may believe that you have sent me.” A simple logic governs today’s ecumenical movement: unity comes first. Before “the world may believe” before Christians can achieve the final clause of John 17:21 we must fulfill the first clause unity. This translates into lots of high-level dialogues aimed at resolving doctrinal disagreements but not into much common evangelistic effort. But there’s another way to read John 17:21—in reverse. It’s startling to look back from today’s dialogue-heavy ecumenism to discover that the 1910 conference didn’t involve a lick of dialogue. That meeting—the World Missionary Conference—aimed in a different direction. Organizers like Methodist layman John R. Mott saw great promise for spreading the gospel through the expanding network of railroads. They adopted a motto “the evangelization of the world in this generation” and let nothing stand in their way. They invited Baptists Methodists Lutherans Episcopalians Presbyterians Quakers and others to get together and talk banning dialogue about doctrine so they wouldn’t be diverted from conversation about missionary cooperation. Simple logic. In the words of one Baptist newspaper “The world has to be evangelized. God wills it.” The logic produced intriguing possibilities like cooperating in some foreign mission fields rather than working in parallel along denominational lines. After all as delegate Cheng Jingyi put it “Denominationalism has never interested the Chinese mind. He finds no delight in it but sometimes he suffers for it!” Tragically four years later this boatload of missionary zeal struck a big rock—World War I. The energy devoted to sending missionaries got diverted into a fight for Europe. But the boat survived and soon the same churches began talking about unity. Orthodox Christians joined a conversation in 1920 that eventually yielded the World Council of Churches in 1948. At the Second Vatican Council in 1964 the Roman Catholic Church made an irrevocable commitment to ecumenism. This thread of discussion about unity leads straight to Cardinal Kasper’s proposed catechism a joint articulation of the basics relevant to any future missionary cooperation. But many veterans are concerned for the ecumenical movement’s future. Ecumenical dialogue “is perhaps in danger of becoming a matter for specialists and thus of moving away from the grassroots” Cardinal Kasper says. Anyone who has counted nearly as many churches as people in a small town could agree with Anglican Archbishop N.T. Wright’s remark:  “Let’s not fool ourselves that if we can agree around the table in Rome this solves all problems of church unity. . . . It’s just the beginning.” 2010 is as ripe with evangelistic possibilities as 1910. The Internet and the global economy are a railway for ideas and people such as the world has never seen. It’s time for all who love ecumenism to pick up the flag of the World Missionary Conference—“the evangelization of the world in this generation”—to seize on opportunities created by fruitful dialogues and bring the ecumenical movement back to the grassroots. The story of the last 100 years shows Christian unity coming as the direct result of missionary cooperation not the other way around. John 17:21 is still the right verse—but read it in reverse: By banding together to help the whole world believe Christians from every denomination might just fulfill our Lord’s great prayer “that they may all be one.” Bold missionary action launched the ecumenical movement. The same can see it through to 2110.",https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1
15,March 18 2010 2:47 a.m.,A Surprise Tooth,By Chris Meehan Last November five-year-old Veronica Linczer sat in a small examining room in an Indianapolis children’s hospital along with her parents Ron and Anne (South Bend) and nine doctors and medical students. Veronica was scheduled for surgery on her cleft palate until the oral surgeon the plastic surgeon and the orthodontist got a look at her mouth. “This is remarkable!” the doctors kept repeating. Veronica was born with a cleft palate though not one that was obvious when her lips were closed. “Inside her mouth on her upper-right palate there was a trench-like opening or cleft covered by a clump of skin that should have contained bone and teeth” Anne explains. “When she smiled you could see the malformed skin in place of one of her teeth.” When she turned three Ron and Anne had to decide whether to schedule a major surgery that would graft bone from Veronica’s hip onto her jawbone. If Veronica didn’t have the surgery by the time she turned six a permanent tooth would not be able to grow in the cleft. “We delayed surgery to give the Lord time to act” says Anne. “We invited everyone at our branch meeting to join our family in our daily prayer for healing.” After praying for more than a year a baby tooth mysteriously began to poke its way through the folded skin. It took six months to twist and turn into a normal downward position. The doctors in Indianapolis said they had never seen a tooth emerge from a cleft like that because there hadn’t been enough bone to support a tooth. An X-ray had revealed new bone growth and another surprise—the shadow of an adult tooth waiting to replace the baby tooth. A graft was no longer necessary so the doctors called off the surgery. “It was a true healing” Anne exclaims. “The gap in her gum line is gone and the cleft is gone. Her palate is in one piece.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=15
20,March 18 2010 1:02 a.m.,Ready to Follow,By Chris Meehan  Nick After getting six or seven doors shut in their faces South Side missionaries Rus Lyons and Catherine Ficker came to a house Rus knew well: Nick and Bonnie’s place. Typically Bonnie would come to the door and offer friendly conversation while Nick stayed quietly in the background. One time a missionary had encouraged Nick to forgive his father and follow Jesus but Nick had insisted that he wasn’t ready. Nick answered the door this December day. A former coal miner from West Virginia he stood on the top step wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. He had jet-black hair a deep voice and thick glasses. He feared going blind and losing his driver’s license. He had some news. “I forgave my father” he told Rus. Then he started in on his familiar refrain: “I’m not ready to follow the Lord.” “What would following the Lord look like to you?” Rus asked. “Giving up smoking and too much TV plus attending church” Nick said. Rus pointed out that Nick was already following the Lord. It was Jesus who had inspired him to forgive his father. “Nick God wants to heal your eyes” Rus continued “but on one condition. You can’t say you aren’t ready to follow him—you already are! “Tomorrow when you get up your eyes won’t hurt and have build-up on them. This will be a sign to you that you are ready. And don’t worry about how your whole life will change just pray and fast and ask the Lord what you should do next.” As Rus and Catherine prayed over Nick he looked up and down Alabama Street. “Wow! I can see” he said. “Really. It’s amazing.” He squinted and read the words on the cover of a Bible. The next day when he woke up the film and pain in his eyes were still gone. He prayed like Rus said and the Lord told him that he should go out in his yard and rake the leaves. The day after that his eyes remained painless but he couldn’t read anymore. Rus and Catherine came back to visit him several more times praying for his eyes each time. His pain is still gone and now he can read the large type again. “He’s excited to see us now” Rus says. “And he doesn’t say that he’s not ready to follow God.”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=20
29,March 18 2010 12:50 a.m.,A Revealing Dream,By Chris Meehan  Joe Bulger and Robert   Missionaries Peter Putzier and Joe Bulger (Indianapolis) were rapping on the door of a small South Side home when Robert a trim 6’2’’ young man turned the handle. “Repent for the kingdom of God is here!” Peter said delivering a message he’d received in prayer that morning. Robert nearly cut him off. “Oh man I had a dream about you guys!” The night before in his dream he had seen two men come to his door: two men who looked exactly like Peter and Joe. Robert had been unable to speak in the dream but he talked eagerly with the missionaries Robert’s friends a man and two women joined the conversationasking questions about predictions that a world-altering tragedy is coming in 2012 and whether it’s okay to smoke marijuana since God made it. “God made bears too but they’re still dangerous!” Peter replied with a smile. After half an hour of talk Peter addressed Robert directly: “What are you going to do about the dream? What’s your next step?” Robert said that his mother wanted him to go to church again. He said he’d take her the next day. “Robert was in awe that we were there” Peter remembers. “He recognized the hand of God.” A couple of weeks later Peter and Joe went back to see Robert. He had gone to church the Sunday before. He also said he wanted his newborn son to grow up knowing about the Lord. “It was clear that what we had talked about during our first visit was on his mind. The Lord had definitely paved the way for us!”,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=29
