# Black Lives in the Twitterverse

A fake Twitter account (@Blacktivists) created and operated by the Russian government had been partially captured by the Document the Now project.

After looking the tweets, I decided to compare them to the actual Black Lives Matter organization along with another black lives movement (M4BL).

## Supporting Files

The datasets are contained in `spreadsheets` along with the initial csv output from the `twint` commands and the spreadsheet containing the topics study with tweets by week calculations.

The resulting files of links from the tweets for each dataset are in the `links` folder.

The graphs generated by Excel for topics and tweets by week are in the `images` folder. The lists of image links for BLM and M4BL datasets are also in the `images` folder.

Commands and command output are in the `commands` folder along with formulas utilized.
