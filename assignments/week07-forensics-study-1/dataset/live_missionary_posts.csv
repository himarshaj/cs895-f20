For the past month the missionaries in Allendale/Lakeside David Zimmel Joe Bulger and Kevin McShane have been systematically knocking on every door within several blocks of our new start on Yale Street. ""Though the People of Praise has been on Yale Street for more than 12 years we've discovered a great many of our neighbors we have never met"" said David. ""We also discovered that by visiting neighbors running summer camp and doing neighborhood fix-it projects that our neighbors have a deep respect for our work and really appreciate our presence."" During this latest effort the missionaries are using a wall sized map to keep track of the homes they have visited and making follow-up visits to homes where no one was available and to homes where people wanted to hear more about our work. This effort in part was initiated to gauge and to understand the degree of interest that our neighbors might have in us forming a grade school. The missionaries have found that many of our neighbors want to talk about educational opportunities for their children. ""Not surprisingly many of our neighbors have really appreciated the opportunity their children have had to attend our annual summer camp"" said David ""and so are interested in what we may be able to do year round."" ""We are not ready to make a decision about establishing a school"" he said ""this effort to meet and speak with our neighbors on the topic of education is a step in that direction."" The current efforts to meet the neighbors has also given the missionaries living in Allendale a wider window into the needs of our neighbors. ""We've had an opportunity to get to better know people and for them to get to know us and our work"" said David. David has been impressed with how passionate our neighbors are to raise the next generation for the Lord. Bless the effort Lord!"
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4108,4108,Dec. 1 2014 4:45 p.m.,Be Sober Minded,"Be sober minded. At all times there is great sorrow and great joy in the lives of those around us. It was Thursday and one of our neighborhood friends had been telling us for days that he wanted to cook for us. Thursday is melange day a day where we combine and eat all our leftovers. We had a ton of tasty leftovers and on top of that our friend was able to join us for dinner and decided to cook up some deep fried pork. We barely had enough room to fit all the food on the table. Our eyes minds and hearts were on the food. Surely a gift from God. We sat down and started serving the food. We laughed and joked around knowing that our day was over and all that was scheduled for the rest of the evening was food fellowship and sleep. Then Rus's phone started ringing. It was Job. Job is a quiet sober young man. Whenever we met Job he was caring for us two year old son. His son had been living with him for the past nine months. His girlfriend had left Job for another man very early on and had left the child in his care. Job first came over to tell missionaries that he and his son were getting evicted and were soon to be homeless. He told us that everything seemed to feel better after he talked to us. We went and visited him a week later. He moved into his friend’s small apartment with his son. It was obvious that Job was doing better. One clear thing was his love for his son. I saw him smile once or twice and each time it was due to something his son was doing. We said goodbye and promised him we would try to see him again sometime. (Con't below photo)  Gabe Yohe Nick Holovaty Nick Raway Chris Raway. At dinner that Thursday evening began Rus picked up the phone. His face turned serious. He walked away and talked on the phone in the corner for a while. He turned to us saying ”The cops are at Job’s house. His wife is trying to take his son. I'm gonna go over there and try to settle things down."" We all prayed together and Rus went on his way. Our conversation was much more sober for a while as we discussed the situation. Slowly however our conversation became much more jovial. We devoured the scrumptious food and began laughing once again. The food was so good that night. Compared to what we usually had the pork tasted divine. The only thing that could get my mind off the food was a full stomach. The time flew and then the back door opened. It was Rus and he looked torn up but chuckled when he saw our wonderful dinner. Rus told us ”Job’s ex-girlfriend took the child and the cops couldn't do anything about it. Job had no way to fight back legally and the mother claimed that she had been taking care of the kid all along. Job was irate"" While listening to what happened we all were hushed and some of us were holding back tears. Job's former girlfriend simply came and took the child from Job's arms. There was nothing Job could do about it. Job was powerless. When the mother drove away all Job could do was silently cry. His child and his pride had been taken away from him. Rus drove Job to a friend’s house for the night. On the way Rus and Job discussed what to do. Job could easily go take the child back from the girlfriend but that would land him in prison. There wasn't much Job could do. He was homeless and now childless and brokenhearted. Job is our neighbor. When we hear stories like Job's we want to help. When we love them we share their sorrow and when they love us they share our joy. Lord give us a heart for the hurting the lost and the brokenhearted."
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4503,4503,Feb. 2 2015 2:20 p.m.,Later on...,"Sometimes we don’t see what the Lord is up to until much later. On a recent Sunday morning I (Laura Brummer) was talking to a neighborhood grandmother on the phone about how many kids from her house might be able to go to church with us that morning. We got into a reflective conversation about how one grandson in particular is doing so well and has changed a lot over the last five years. I mentioned how he rarely has angry outbursts anymore and in general he is so much happier. She added that his teachers praise him for being a big help to his classmates. Praise God! Then she said ""And he hasn't had a seizure in four years!” ""What?” Is he taking seizure meds?” I asked. ""Nope!” She replied. ""Wait a minute what about that time when he was in the hospital a couple years ago nearly unresponsive due to continuous seizures?” I asked further. ""That was four years ago and he hasn't had any since!” She replied. Wow! Then I remembered that Jeanette Duddy my sister Abby Brummer (down on an action trip) and I had prayed with him for healing at the hospital. It's amazing to find out four years later that the Lord answered our prayers and healed our young brother! Glory!"
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4507,4507,March 7 2015 2:39 p.m.,Common Life in the Lord,"""One thing that’s been on my mind is what can we do with our neighbors that they want to do with us so that we can grow a common life together over time?” Said Nathan Barrett. Here’s a good example. A year ago a mother of four in our neighborhood died of cancer. A few weeks ago as the anniversary of her passing approached the four children asked the missionaries if there was something they could do to honor the memory of their mother. When Kevin McShane asked one of the children why he wanted to do the event on Yale Street he said ""This is the place where God lives most.” On a cloudy Sunday morning the missionaries some Christian in Mission folks some friends of the children and the four children gathered on Yale Street to honor their mother. There was punch chocolate cake and cupcakes for everyone to enjoy. Each child took a turn to share about their mom. After the honorings the group went outside each holding a balloon. One of the children led the group in a prayer and they all sang “There is Power in the Name of Jesus.” Then they released the balloons and silently watched them drift up and out of sight. ""It was a very tangible way that we are building the kingdom here in the neighborhood” said Brigette Mysliwiec. Joan Pingel added ""I was very moved by the children's reaction when they walked in and saw a group of people with refreshments ready to honor their mother. The kids were really moved by all that was done."" By the grace of God and by our presence we are building life in common in Allendale."
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4516,4516,March 11 2015 2:44 p.m.,We are his hands.,We are his hands. With all the snow that came down in Evansville recently we missionaries have regularly sent out teams to shovel out our neighbors who need the help. This picture shows two teams deploying together to shovel out Sharon one of our close friends in the neighborhood who uses a wheelchair ramp to access her home. Sharon was so delighted with the help she sent us a thank you card: Dear Evansville Missionaries I wanted to take a moment and thank you all so much for showing up last week to shovel my walk and ramp! That ministered to me a lot! The reason is that I could now get out -- at least to my car. Also I had prayed about an hour before and had asked God to help me with this situation and then -- here you all were! God has challenged me to really believe that He will answer not just hope he will. In this situation I had to chose to believe He would - because he loves me this much! So again I wanted to thank you for your part in increasing my faith in God's love for me. I can look back on this situation if I am tempted to doubt in the future. I am so very glad that you all are here in Evansville! What a difference you make in our neighborhood! May God continue to bless all your efforts! Love Sharon
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4521,4521,March 21 2015 4:20 p.m.,Missionary Music,"Our missionaries living in Evansville have launched a new website where anyone in the world can listen to songs they have written and performed: http://missionarymusic.org Mike Zusi announced the site at the Leaders' Conference for Men in South Bend last week during a talk on the role of music in community life. On the main page of the website visitors can listen to a playlist of all the songs (currently there are 21). The ""Download"" page includes downloadable PDF files with lyrics and chord sheets and downloadable tracks. A ""Watch"" page features YouTube videos that show the missionaries performing the songs. The songs include prayer meeting songs composed by the missionaries traditional hymns (""All Creatures of Our God and King"") spirituals (""Ride on King Jesus"") and performance pieces. The songs are performed in a variety of styles from bluegrass to rock to rap and they feature banjo cello guitar violin harmonica beatboxing and unaccompanied choral singing. ""This music comes out of our life in the People of Praise"" says Nick Holovaty who leads the missionaries. ""It reflects the joys that come with living and working together and our personal experiences in the mission field. I hope that many people enjoy the music that it blesses them and that our music can get out to as many people as possible."" The site is designed so that listeners can easily spread the word about the music on Facebook Twitter and Google Plus as well as by email. Mary Timler a missionary with a background as a cellist designed and built the site with help from Dan Sullivan a web developer and an underway member of the new start in Evansville. ""Music is a huge part of the life and outreach of the Missionary Company and that is in large part due to Chris Vieck a classically trained singer and choral director who led music in the South Bend branch for many years"" says Nick. Music performed by the missionaries has been a staple at community weddings and at community summer camps over the past few years. Kathleen Reinhardt said that the music the missionaries sang at her wedding to Ben Reinhardt in Shreveport in January was ""just beautiful"" and a profound reflection of the call to mission that she experiences in the community. ""People have been emailing me asking for our chord sheets and encouraging us to let our light shine"" says Mary. ""This music is a gift from the Lord and we want to share it. So download it share it play it everywhere as often as you like!"""
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4609,4609,April 13 2015 3:03 p.m.,Action Summer Coming Soon,This past weekend some of us went up to South Bend to attend the Action Conference. The conference reminded us that the work of Action is integral to all the Lord wants us to accomplish in the Mississippi Valley. The property work the mission work and the summer kids' camps are such an important part of moving everything forward. Planning is now underway for the upcoming Action summer so join us in praying for all the Lord has in store for us this summer.  The conference featured a track on the role of music in our culture.  The music track at the conference included the challenge of writing a song on a tight deadline! Amazingly every group managed to get something done that sounded good.
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4671,4671,April 27 2015 1:12 p.m.,There's Jesus,"There's Jesus. Recently a group of college-aged students from northern Virginia and South Bend were visiting. One night the missionaries taught them how to sing some of our favorite choral pieces and we sang together in our living room for nearly an hour. As we finished I (George) heard a voice say “That was beautiful!” I didn’t recognize the voice at all! I looked around to figure out where the voice had come from and just outside our window a woman was standing in the side yard listening to us sing!After introducing herself she told us that she had just moved to the neighborhood earlier that week and was going through a really rough time of trial. She had been walking down the street asking God for help when ""all the sudden I heard y'all and I thought to myself There's Jesus!"" We were able to go outside and pray with her. Thank you Lord for the gift of music.    Missionaries and guests gather around the open window."
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4714,4714,May 21 2015 1:03 p.m.,An Easter Feast,An Easter feast. Recently the Allendale CIM team had a discussion where we all voiced a desire to do more with our neighbors - to share our lives more and to put more time in common as neighbors. We decided on holding a neighborhood crawfish boil a Louisiana specialty. Bridgette Mysliwiec and Elizabeth Grondin and I (Laura Brummer) were able to walk around inviting lots of neighbors during the week prior which afforded us great visits with our neighbors. An hour before the event Joe Bulger and I went around inviting more people and reminding others and asking if anyone needed a ride. One woman was ready to go and hopped into the van with us. The event was great! Several members of the Shreveport branch came as well as a handful of neighbors. Some folks driving by stopped to fill up a plate. There was a lot of good fellowship around each table. One great moment was when Nathan Barrett brought his two daughters to meet Martin. The girls frequently watch a video of Martin singing a song that he wrote about Jesus. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1QKNSF-X_4) One daughter often sings it around the house. The girls got to hear a live version right there on our parking pad bringing big smiles on their faces! God really blessed our time together.
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4721,4721,May 27 2015 9:59 a.m.,Urban Farm Project,"The Urban Farm Project. This spring the Missionary Company in Evansville began an urban farm project on a vacant lot in their neighborhood. The purpose of the farm project was of course to grow vegetables fruit and flowers but the farm project was also aimed at being a community building project in Evansville engaging our neighbors and providing a beautiful landscape for the neighborhood. A committee of three missionaries and two underway adults in Evansville was formed to make a proposal to the remaining team in Evansville. A proposal was made and accepted to start a farm this spring. John Earhart was chosen to lead the Farm Project. Raised beds were made out of old sections of reclaimed fences. Using a very modest budget donations and their labor the People of Praise in Evansville was able to plant 22 beds and three 25 foot rows. The growing beds and rows included vegetables flowers and fruit. They also planted six fruit trees; three plum two peach and one pear. The project attracted a lot attention on the block. “People were really interested in what we were up to” said John “we’ve been able to meet new people and to renew acquaintances as people stop by to see the farm project. Everyone who stops is really encouraged by what we're doing. The farm project has also given us an opportunity to get out and work together in the beautiful spring weather in Evansville."" As the pictures indicate it’s an ambitious project. John and the Missionary Company have organized a schedule to maintain the farm as the summer progresses. We’ll keep you updated as the growing season unfolds."
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4805,4805,Aug. 14 2015 8:44 a.m.,Thanks for Healing Me,"Evan and I (Annie) were canvassing together. We knocked on the end door of a small four door apartment strip. A tall skinny man in his 60's answered the door he smiled said we had been there a couple weeks ago (different team had a brief encounter with him) and invited us right in. His bottom teeth were very brown and he was missing one of his top front teeth. His left pointer and thumb finger each had a circle of black burned skin. He spoke softly difficult to hear at times but was very welcoming. We all sat down in the small dark room - he sat in a big recliner with a large bag of mint tobacco at his feet and the materials for rolling your own cigarettes scattered near by we sat on two metal chairs. We talked about the neighborhood - what he thought of it how long he'd lived in this apartment (a couple months) who he knew around here and the church he'd been recently going to. A couple days prior to our visit he had been in the hospital to try and figure out why he'd been experiencing a lot of numbness and weakness in all his extremities. After running some tests the doctors had told him he was ""100% fine"" and sent him home. This was good news except that he was still symptomatic and didn't know what to do next. He'd even had his sister helping him with bills and such around the house due to his fatigue and numbness. After asking us to pray with him we told a story about how God had healed a woman's knee. Then Evan asked how he would be able to measure a difference if we prayed and God healed him. His response was notable...""Oh I don't expect God to heal me right away...I mean maybe over time...but I don't expect some miracle healing. No. I don't expect that."" We clarified ""but you do want pray?"" ""Yes!"" We laid hands on him and prayed for healing from numbness and for an increase in strength. As soon as we said ""Amen"" he waved his arms around in the air a little and nonchalantly said (but with a little smile) ... ""Yeh it feels better. Mhm. The numbness is better. My elbows feel different. They divided and loosened up."" My jaw dropped as Evan and I exclaimed praises to God. And for the last couple minutes of our visit he said several times ""Thanks for coming by and thanks for healing me."" I was so moved by God's delight in healing his son who expected ""no miracle healing."""
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4812,4812,Aug. 24 2015 10:09 a.m.,Don't forget about me.,By Evan LentRecently as Laura Ellen and I (Evan) were doing new mission we were moved by a white house. We paused on the porch which smelled of cigarette smoke and asked for a word. We heard the Lord tell us to talk about his abundant mercy how willing he is to forgive our sins. After we knocked a woman in her fifties wearing pajamas opened the door. She introduced herself as Suzanne and after introducing ourselves we gave her the word. She said “I know I’ve done a lot of things I’m not proud of.” She recognized Ellen from when she lived in a different house a few years ago. “You and a man gave me a bible.” She said it was the point where she started to head back towards the Lord. Since then she’d gotten rid of a lot of sin. We told her about how God is filling people with his Holy Spirit. We shared how it had changed our lives in things like our experience of reading scripture and the ability to hear the Lord. She wanted us to pray with her. Before praying with her I asked if there was a particular gift of the Spirit she wanted to ask for. She said “I want to do right and live for God.” After we prayed we told her to be on the lookout for the Lord doing new things in her life. Abby and I went back the next week. We asked if things had been different since we prayed last week. “It’s like a weight has been lifted off me” she said. “And I used to get all worried about things” she said clenching her fists to demonstrate. “But now I don’t. I’ve got this peace” she said relaxing her hands. “It used to be like there was a storm inside of me and now it’s peaceful. For years I had this like hole inside of me I couldn’t fill. And that’s gone. For the last several weeks I’ve been crying every day. But that’s stopped since y’all prayed. Now I have this giggly feeling inside. And I used to have terrible nightmares I’d wake up crying – they were about terrible stuff. And those are gone too.” We asked her if she’d been experiencing any new desires. “Yes. I want to go to church. And you make think it’s funny but I want to tell people on Facebook about Jesus.” She’d been doing it too. She explained that it’d really been laying on her heart to go out and tell people about what God had done in her life. At one point I glanced down trying to pray and think of what to do next in the conversation. She said “you’ve probably noticed me swaying and staying off this foot.” She explained that her son had been lifting weights recently and dropped the barbell just as she walked by. It landed on her left foot. The doctor said it was fractured. Suzanne was tired of medical bills so decided to just stay off it until it got better. We offered to pray and she gladly accepted saying “but you don’t want to put your hands on my ugly foot!” After we prayed Suzanne winced as she tried putting some weight on the foot. “Still hurts” she confirmed. We kept talking but after a few minutes we noticed that Suzanne was standing with her weight equally on each foot. We asked how her foot was. “It doesn’t hurt at all!” At the end of our conversation Suzanne said “please come back don’t forget about me.”
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4842,4842,Sept. 21 2015 4:57 p.m.,Growing in Evansville,"Growing in Evansville. The garden has been in full bloom for the past month and a half. So far we have harvested over 21 different types of vegetables and herbs -- 26 lbs of lettuce over 100 cucumbers 20 lbs of Okra 100 lbs of cherry tomatoes and cantaloupe! The excess has allowed us to give some favorites away to our neighbors. The garden has provided a great opportunity for all the members of the People of Praise in Evansville to spend time working growing in friendship and maintaining a beautiful space for the neighborhood.  One of our older neighbors who goes for walks around the neighborhood every day told one of the missionaries as they were watering the seedlings that she prays for the Garden every time she passes it which is two or three times a day. Two men driving down the alley stopped and told a group of missionaries as they shoveled dirt that ""We've been praying for that tree"" pointing to a plum tree visible from the alley. One of the neighbors who lives near the garden told us ""a lot of times at night I will come out and walk around the garden it's so quiet and beautiful!"" Lastly on many occasions throughout the summer girls will stop and ask to have some flowers from the sisters flower bed. They are then taught the proper way to cut the flowers as for many of the girls it is their first time. They always leave with a glowing smile! The garden has been a great source of growth. One example is between Kaitlyn Raway and Carrie Johnson who helps manage the farm. Kaitlyn says ""I didn't get to see Carrie regularly until we started working in the garden together. Carrie taught me about plants pretty much every time we worked together. I was amazed that she could go up to little tiny plants and know what they were. I also started to take on the cares and concerns that Carrie had about whether or not any of our seeds/seedlings (mostly tomatoes) were even going to make it. I joined in Carrie's joy when we had more than enough tomato plants to go around."" Please pray that the garden continues to be a source of community growth and beauty in the neighborhood."
http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=4868,4868,Oct. 6 2015 12:48 p.m.,Praise Academy Update,"The school year continues to unfold for our new Praise Academy in Allendale/Lakeside.  Eight students attend the school and they range from fifth grade down to pre-school.  “We’ve been organizing and re-organizing our schedule as we understand more fully what works best for our students” said Joan Pingel head of school.  The staff Joan Pingel Colleen Bowar and Kevin McShane has developed a set of routines that that proven very helpful for the students.  “The kids weren’t accustomed to routines and it’s been really helpful for them to know the daily routine.  They’ve come to depend on it” said Joan. The staff recently instituted a time for free play.  The students needed some help to begin to use their imaginations for play.  “It took a little coaching but it’s been wonderful to see how play time has awakened their imaginations” Joan said. Another highlight for Joan was teaching a six year old to write his name.  He arrived for school this year with no experience with letters but had a real determination to learn how to write his name and though it took some time and a lot of effort he succeeded.   It took much more time and effort than the student expected but that yielded some real improvement in his interest in learning more things and his determination to push through some harder work. The school day begins with faculty prayer at 7:15 am.  The school provides breakfast for the students at 8:00 am followed by group morning prayer.  The morning is divided into two class sessions separated by a time for physical education.  At noon a neighbor comes and prepares lunch.  In the early afternoon the younger students have a nap time and class time continues for the older students. The CIM team pitches in to help out in a variety of ways — preparing breakfast picking up kids for school and helping out where needed.  “This school is a full CIM effort” said David Zimmel coordinator for the CIM team.  “It has been a real blessing to the team (and the Shreveport branch) to be able to help so much with the school. I think everyone on the team is helping out every week and most of branch is helping in one way or another. Working with our kids in the neighborhood has always been one of the big ways we experience serving Christ but it is just wonderful to be able to help out every week and to be a part of something that has started so well.  It is also amazing to see the dedication creativity and expertise of teachers. They are working terrifically hard to get this started and it is really impressive.""When asked what help the school needs Joan said “We could use clothing for the kids a few more iPads for phonics training more folders (all the kids want a folder to bring home!).  If you’d like to help out by making a donation there’s a “donate” button here:  http://www.praiselakeside.org/how-togive/"

The kids are playing sports making crafts and singing songs of praise every day as they grow in friendship with the Lord with each other and the camp leaders. Some highlights from the first week included: launching water bottle rockets learning how to use a stethoscope and read X-Rays (taught by local IU med students) making ornate paper fans and learning praise dances. Please pray for the staff as the number of kids will likely continue to grow for the next two weeks of camp. Come Lord continue to build up our younger brothers and sisters into men and women after your own heart!

They made crowns and had icee pops in the 90+ degree heat to celebrate. The heat also couldn't keep our oldest boys' group down as they played hard team-focused basketball with one key rule: pitch the trash talk. Our camp kids also get regular tours of our community farm: Praise Harvest. They learn how with a little work on our part God's creation can yield fruit to sustain us right here on the South Side."

http://peopleofpraise.org/missionary/?p=5679,5679,Jan. 31 2017 12:08 a.m.,Saying Goodbye to a Friend,by Pam Seale I remember the first time I met our old neighbor Tom. Walt had already met him. The two of us were walking home from Starbuck’s down on 11th Street and he was walking toward us. Tom walked at least seven miles a day I’d been told. He was scary to me: an elderly white man unkept with layers of old dirty clothes and tinted large eyeglasses from the 1970’s. You couldn’t tell where his facial hair stopped and his head of hair began. It was all just an uncut unshaven mess. He asked us if we were coming from the free breakfast place. He was holding a bag and was going to get some for himself. Different worlds Starbucks and a food kitchen. Tom started stopping by the house to chat. The relationship was a slow grow. When Walt was busy we’d sit in the living room and I’d listen as Tom talked. Life had been hard. He married a black woman when it wasn’t acceptable. He told the story of his wife's death every time he came over. He never talked about his two sons’ deaths. That I heard about from the missionaries. Violence. Drugs. Bad living. Bad endings. Tom had dealt with his life full of pain with alcohol. Now he was alone with his house which was unkept with rodents living upstairs and rain falling in the living room when it rained. His appearance wasn’t much better. But that didn’t matter to me anymore. I saw Christ. I saw his pain. It didn’t matter how much of it he’d caused. It was there. He didn’t have a mean bone in his body and was quite an entertaining story teller. We saw less of Tom in the summer months when Action was here. Then Jack Busekrus went and sat on his porch with him. He later told us Tom was afraid to come near our property because he thought we were running a juvenile delinquent summer program. All those tee shirts made him think prisoners! For seven years he called the shots. He came to us when he wanted to and wouldn’t come if we invited him which we did. The first time I sent him over food he told Walt “You’ll have to tell your wife I live alone. She sent over a whole loaf of banana bread and it almost killed me!” Oh yes. Tom made you laugh. He had a dry wit and it was one way he revealed himself little by little. Tom had a love and respect for our sisters in household. He brought them flowers from his bushes and told them they could come and take his blossoms to decorate their table with anytime. Once he came to tell Walt about a man parked outside on our street. He was concerned for the women’s safety. He’d become our protector. The last couple of years Tom’s mind started failing. He started coming for Walt for more needs. He’d lock himself out of the house or he couldn’t get his car started. He couldn’t understand bills that came in the mail. We helped him as we would any brother. Our last help for him was to organize a family meeting. Tom’s sister and daughter came to our home. Tom agreed to sell his house and move into an apartment for his own good. He didn’t want to live with anyone or get medical care. It was bittersweet when he left but it was how Tom wanted it. Living alone. No doctors. No nursing homes. We saw him in December. He stopped by for a chat. He weighed a little less but everything else was the same. Last week I got a call that he passed alone in his apartment. It was just what he wanted. No fanfare. Reunited with his family. It doesn’t sound like an average mission story but Tom Walt and I would never have met if we didn’t move into this neighborhood. I would have missed seeing Christ in him. And Tom? Without pride but just gratitude to a God who orchestrates such things Tom got to have more of Christ loving him in the flesh because the Body of Christ had moved into his neighborhood.

Pray Zechariah 8:12 with us: [12] For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit and the ground shall give its produce and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
