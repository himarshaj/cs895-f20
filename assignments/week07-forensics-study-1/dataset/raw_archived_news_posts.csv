Kerry Koller: The Trinity School Vision

“Trinity School owes its essence and its very existence to Paul DeCelles—he gave us as a school a love for humanity, for human desires and for the human project.”

Kevin Ranaghan: Paul DeCelles and 30 years of Trinity School

“If Paul DeCelles is to be thought of nautically in relation to Trinity, I have to say, without fear of exaggeration, that he has been Trinity’s architect and builder. He has been Trinity’s captain and navigator and at times its helmsman. He has fulfilled all these functions for more than 30 years. The result is that Trinity floats, sails, survives the tempests, and comes safely to port year after year.”

						Mission Work  |  6 Comments",Permanent Link: For Former Missionaries It’s Back to College,"By Sean Connolly and Chris Meehan

Annie Bulger and Liz Loughran
This fall four former missionaries are returning to college after completing two years of missionary work. For John Bowar, Annie Bulger, Liz Loughran and Claire Mysliwiec, the move from the mission field to the campus quad brings changes large and small: spending long hours on homework that used to be devoted to evangelism, hauling heavy textbooks instead of only a pocket Bible and traveling solo to classes rather than always moving with a small missionary team. So how is the transition going?
“Missionaries go back to school with a more mature vision for their own education,” notes Nick Holovaty, who has observed the transition closely as the program coordinator responsible for the community’s campus divisions. “They’re two years older, and they’ve had two years of experiences outside the classroom, talking with people from every walk of life.”
After wrapping up his missionary work last May, John Bowar traveled first to Minnesota for a summer geology research internship and then to Alaska for two weeks of fieldwork. Camping with researchers in Katmai National Park, John collected 100-year-old samples of volcanic ash, samples that may reveal historical information about the intensity of the earth’s magnetic field.
John Bowar
Like missionary work (knocking on doors), geology work (knocking on rocks) is not always glamorous. “My first assignment was breaking small rocks into smaller rocks,” John says. “That was fine because I had decided to throw myself into my studies with the same intensity I’d had for missionary life.” Now returned from Alaska, John has a bigger course load than ever before (including classes for his geology major), and he’s a member of a busy household of five in Servant Branch’s campus division.
Claire, a junior history major at the University of Notre Dame, says her stint with the missionaries has helped her stay both more focused and more relaxed about her studies. “I’m a lot less concerned about grades than I was before. The reason I am in school is bigger than grades—learning what I can, so that I can serve the Lord.”
For Claire, Annie and Liz, at least one important aspect of their lives in Evansville remains the same. After joining the Sisterhood during their missionary stint and living together in household for two years, all three are household members once again—this time in one of the households of the Sisterhood in the South Bend branch. (The Sisterhood is a group of women in the People of Praise who are single for the Lord and financially in-common, and who live together in several households.)
“The simplicity of household life in the Sisterhood has helped me make a fairly smooth transition back to school,” Claire says. As an added blessing, Claire spent her summer working as an intern in a financial-planning office alongside fellow Sisterhood member Christin Rose.
In addition to taking classes in math and biology at Notre Dame, Annie and Liz are continuing the part-time jobs they held as missionaries. Both are web site developers for one:ten communications, a division of the LaSalle Company that builds web sites for educational publishers.
After two years of talking almost daily with strangers, the returned students report walking around their campuses with a new awareness—that every person they meet is someone the Lord loves.  “I see myself differently,” Claire says. “I have an understanding that the Lord is sending me to people, and that’s on my mind as I interact with students and professors.”
But the returning students are clear about their primary purpose on campus. “The Lord is calling me to be a student,” as Liz puts it. Armed with that call, and carrying with them missionary instincts that may never be erased, the four are working hard to discover how to serve the Lord in their new circumstances.
Editor’s note: Four community members have recently joined the group of missionaries living in Evansville, replacing the four who have returned to college. The new missionaries are Peter Coleman, Mary Grams, Gianna Priolo and Jeanette Zimmel."

						Mission Work  |  12 Comments",Permanent Link: Near Campus in Indy the Community’s Presence Grows,"Fifty-four people gathered for a Lord's Day meal to open the school year.
The community’s presence in the Triangle is rapidly increasing. The Triangle is a neighborhood adjacent to the joint campus of Indiana and Purdue University in Indianapolis (IUPUI). A seed planted there by three missionaries in the winter of 2007 is now a growing group of 18, including five freshmen majoring in biology, nursing and philosophy.
“Our goal is to provide a good place for students to go to college, a place where they can study hard, grow in the Lord and live in the community,” says Walt Seale, who leads the effort.
Freshman Chris Walker, a biology major on a premed track, says the urban setting, proximity to major hospitals and the chance to live in a household made IUPUI and life in the Triangle an attractive option for college. “Premed programs are very strong at IUPUI, but the biggest draw for me was common life in household, the Indianapolis branch, and the chance to go to school with a purpose: learning skills to build the kingdom of God.
Back, from left: Walt Seale, Jared Gonzalez, David Gruber, Chris Walker, George Kane, Isaac Bolduc, Meghan Couch. Middle: Emily Feeks, Irene Robinson, Andrea Delee, Laura Kane, Amy Rice, Pam Seale. Front: Jacquelyn Magill, Anne Putzier, Cathy Schwab, Patricia Brewer.
The five freshmen and Walt and Pam Seale are among 10 community members who have relocated to the Triangle in the past year, and more hope to be on the way soon. Matt and Mary Beth Harris (northern Virginia) have announced their plans to move to the Triangle with their daughter Claire, provided that Matt, a construction manager, can find a job in the area.
The growth has created a housing crunch. One household of ten women is shoehorned into a four-bedroom house with two bathrooms and two refrigerators.
Patricia Brewer, who leads the women’s household, remembers starting out in 2008. “There was always room for guests, always a place to pray, and the bathroom was pretty much always open.” This year the women share bunks and desks, and it’s rare to find an empty room.
On August 21, parents and other friends joined the students to open the Lord’s Day and kick off the year.  The group of 54 people included four men from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who frequently make the hourlong trek to the Triangle for Lord’s Day meals and other gatherings.
A household of 10 women is shoehorned into this four bedroom house.
Community members living in the Indianapolis Triangle are members of the campus division of the South Bend branch. The community also has a campus division in Servant Branch for students at the University of Minnesota.

Trish Brewer (left) and Jenny Sergio plant a vegetable garden in the Triangle area of Indianapolis.
 
The Triangle area of Indianapolis wanted fresh vegetables, so this spring Jenny Sergio and Trish Brewer planted a garden—several varieties of tomatoes and peppers in five neat rows behind the duplex. But one Sunday morning in late May Jenny awoke to discover that that their plants had gone missing.
“There were just holes left in the garden,” Trish remembers.
Walt Seale mentioned the purloined plants to Walter, an older neighbor who mows lawns and knows about neighborhood goings-on. “Neighbors just don’t do that,” Walt told him. “We don’t steal one another’s tomato plants.”
Later that afternoon, Walter came to Walt and mumbled a cryptic message: “Walk down the alley and take a look down there on the left.”
Walt followed the alley behind the duplex, but saw no plants.
A few days later, on Wednesday, as Trish walked from her car to the duplex, another neighbor rode up on his mountain bike. A single full beer can dangled from either side of the handlebars, attached there by two six-pack rings.
“I heard about your tomato plants,” he said. “That’s terrible. I don’t like that at all. I’ve got some plants I want to give you.”
“Really? That’s very generous of you,” Trish said.
The man returned with a plastic pot containing three young tomato plants. “I don’t want this kind of thing happening in this neighborhood,” he told her. “We’re all friends here. We don’t want this to be the kind of place where people do that.”
“It sounded exactly like what Walt had told Walter,” Trish remembers.
She thought the plants looked familiar, but she couldn’t be sure. In any case, the Triangle now has a bigger garden than before the heist, thanks to the three tomato plants and some more vegetable plants donated by an Indianapolis branch member.
“We added a whole extra row to the garden,” Trish says."

“He brings to the job of program coordinator the intelligence, energy and idealism that are characteristic of everything that he does.
“In addition to his communications work, Sean participated in the start-up phase of one:ten communications (a technology-focused division of the LaSalle Company), and he continues to serve on the community’s growth team.”
Program coordinators head the community’s program offices—their staff, projects and local divisions. The Principles of Structure and Government provides for five program offices: Action, currently led by Mike Zusi; Education, including the Center for Christian Studies, currently led by Paul DeCelles; Mission, currently led by Nick Holovaty; Communications (formerly known as Publications); and Christian Life Movements, which currently has no assigned program coordinator. Program coordinators are appointed by the overall coordinator and report to Paul DeCelles, the chair of the program coordinators’ council.
Sean says he’s eager to continue expanding the community’s print, web and video communications. “I’m excited about how e-mail and the Internet are helping us to spread news and information rapidly across our 21 branches. And like many, I enjoy flipping through a magazine with thoughtful articles and compelling photos, so I’m looking forward to producing many more issues of Vine & Branches.  I love this work and I am blessed with dedicated and creative co-workers.”
Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty has worked alongside Sean for more than a decade. “Sean has a gift for identifying what the Lord is up to and explaining it well, in complex and even messy situations. He sees what’s most important and articulates it compellingly and enthusiastically.”
Sean, his wife Gretchen and their daughter Gloria live in South Bend. In 2007, Gretchen became the director of photography and layout for Vine & Branches. Both are graduates of Trinity Schools. Gretchen graduated from the University of St. Thomas and Sean is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame."

						Tributes  |  1 Comment",Permanent Link: Gen Ficker,"By Elizabeth Kaiser
Genevieve Ficker, of Hastings, MN, passed away peacefully on October 30 at the age of 90. She was born February 22, 1919, in Nicollet, MN. She and Albert Ficker (who died in 1974) were married in 1945 in Hampton, MN, where Gen started her 40-year career as a beautician. After they moved to Hastings, she owned and operated Gen’s Beauty Shop on Fifth Street.
I met Gen 20 years ago and immediately enjoyed her company and her stories, and singing the songs we both knew. She was a frequent guest at our home for meals and celebrations, and we joined with Gen’s family to celebrate her birthdays as she neared 90. When our sons were little, Gen would entertain them while I prepared lunch after a morning’s outing of garage sales. She shared gardening ideas and taught me how to prepare applesauce her way, which we like much better than the store-bought kind. She was patient and didn’t scold when the boys wielded their knives, Rambo-style, chopping the apples that we cooked and canned. I have thanked the Lord many times for sending Grandma Gen to us, because Ed and I both have families who live out of state. Gen’s faith continues to inspire me.
One of Gen’s six children, Pat, along with his wife Patricia and four of Gen’s grandchildren, Laura, Dan, Lisa and Catherine, are members of the People of Praise. Gen came underway October 23, 1983, in Servant Branch, after she retired. She was an avid card player, cook, gardener and seamstress, and she loved to crochet. One day Gen was talking to a social worker at Regina Assisted Living, where she spent her last few years. She told stories about the many 12-hour days she had worked in the beauty shop and how much she enjoyed those years. The social worker listened to Gen for over an hour. Gen had so many great stories–stories that brought us to laughter and sometimes to the point of tears.
She had a wonderful sense of humor. Her response to Bernadette Fossen’s greeting, “Hi, Gen! How are you?” was, “I’m still alive, but I can’t run as fast.” When Gen visited the Fossens she didn’t arrive empty-handed. She’d say, “Hey! I just picked some raspberries from a friend’s place. Here you go.” Gen then sat on a chair in the kitchen and Bernadette would hand her a baby to hold while they talked or while Grandma Gen shared her recipes . . . homemade pie crust or rhubarb sauce. They laughed over Gen’s stories. Bernadette remembers one of the scariest: Gen was driving a streetcar in St. Paul while studying to become a beautician. “One evening, very late, a man boarded the streetcar and said, ‘It’s a good night for a murder.’ Gen put on a brave front and yelled at him to get to the back . . . but in reality she was scared stiff!”
John Fasbender attended grade school with Pat, and admits to being a frequent visitor at the Ficker home. John and Pat were Minnesota Twins fans from a young age, and Gen would graciously drive them and their friends to ballgames in her convertible. He remembers that Gen was able to corral their exuberance and excitement and patiently not lose her cool. John credits her prayers for their eventual coming to Christ years later. Gen’s patience and faith had its impact on them and on others.
Gen persevered in faith as she faced the physical limitations of old age, such as decline in vision, lack of mobility and arthritis. She told Pat, “Jesus will lead me home; you can count on that, Pat.”
Just a week before she died, when a nurse asked if she wanted to see the doctor about a wound on her leg that wouldn’t heal, Gen replied, “No, it is time to see Jesus.”"

Together with Elizabeth Grams he began the community’s video department, and this year he and his team launched news web sites for the People of Praise and for Trinity Schools.

“He brings to the job of program coordinator the intelligence, energy and idealism that are characteristic of everything that he does.
“In addition to his communications work, Sean participated in the start-up phase of one:ten communications (a technology-focused division of the LaSalle Company), and he continues to serve on the community’s growth team.”
Program coordinators head the community’s program offices—their staff, projects and local divisions. The Principles of Structure and Government provides for five program offices: Action, currently led by Mike Zusi; Education, including the Center for Christian Studies, currently led by Paul DeCelles; Mission, currently led by Nick Holovaty; Communications (formerly known as Publications); and Christian Life Movements, which currently has no assigned program coordinator. Program coordinators are appointed by the overall coordinator and report to Paul DeCelles, the chair of the program coordinators’ council.
Sean says he’s eager to continue expanding the community’s print, web and video communications. “I’m excited about how e-mail and the Internet are helping us to spread news and information rapidly across our 21 branches. And like many, I enjoy flipping through a magazine with thoughtful articles and compelling photos, so I’m looking forward to producing many more issues of Vine & Branches.  I love this work and I am blessed with dedicated and creative co-workers.”
Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty has worked alongside Sean for more than a decade. “Sean has a gift for identifying what the Lord is up to and explaining it well, in complex and even messy situations. He sees what’s most important and articulates it compellingly and enthusiastically.”
Sean, his wife Gretchen and their daughter Gloria live in South Bend. In 2007, Gretchen became the director of photography and layout for Vine & Branches. Both are graduates of Trinity Schools. Gretchen graduated from the University of St. Thomas and Sean is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame."

						Branches  |  1 Comment",Permanent Link: Banding Together So All May Believe,"John R. Mott, a Methodist layman and pioneer of the ecumenical movement, helped organize the World Missionary Conference and spread its informal motto, ""the evangelization of the world in this generation.""
Commentary
By Sean Connolly
At a February conference in Rome, Catholic Cardinal Walter Kasper made a bold proposal to Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed leaders: “an ecumenical catechism,” a joint commentary on the Apostles Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer.
That was unthinkable 100 years ago, when a group of Protestants met in Edinburgh, Scotland, for a conference credited with launching the ecumenical movement. The president of the conference read a telegram to the delegates from Anglican leaders containing a single, prescient Scripture verse: John 17:21.
Nowadays, every place the word “ecumenism” goes, John 17:21 follows: scrappy local prayer services, papal encyclicals, harangues over the scandal of a divided Christianity. It’s ecumenism’s ubiquitous theme—Jesus’ prayer to his Father—usually shortened slightly: “that they may all be one . . . so that the world may believe that you have sent me.”
A simple logic governs today’s ecumenical movement: unity comes first. Before “the world may believe,” before Christians can achieve the final clause of John 17:21, we must fulfill the first clause, unity. This translates into lots of high-level dialogues aimed at resolving doctrinal disagreements, but not into much common evangelistic effort.
But there’s another way to read John 17:21—in reverse.
It’s startling to look back from today’s dialogue-heavy ecumenism to discover that the 1910 conference didn’t involve a lick of dialogue.
That meeting—the World Missionary Conference—aimed in a different direction. Organizers like Methodist layman John R. Mott saw great promise for spreading the gospel through the expanding network of railroads. They adopted a motto, “the evangelization of the world in this generation,” and let nothing stand in their way. They invited Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Quakers and others to get together and talk, banning dialogue about doctrine, so they wouldn’t be diverted from conversation about missionary cooperation.
Simple logic. In the words of one Baptist newspaper, “The world has to be evangelized. God wills it.”
The logic produced intriguing possibilities, like cooperating in some foreign mission fields, rather than working in parallel along denominational lines. After all, as delegate Cheng Jingyi put it, “Denominationalism has never interested the Chinese mind. He finds no delight in it, but sometimes he suffers for it!”
Tragically, four years later, this boatload of missionary zeal struck a big rock—World War I. The energy devoted to sending missionaries got diverted into a fight for Europe.
But the boat survived, and soon the same churches began talking about unity. Orthodox Christians joined a conversation in 1920 that eventually yielded the World Council of Churches in 1948. At the Second Vatican Council in 1964, the Roman Catholic Church made an irrevocable commitment to ecumenism.
This thread of discussion about unity leads straight to Cardinal Kasper’s proposed catechism, a joint articulation of the basics, relevant to any future missionary cooperation.
But many veterans are concerned for the ecumenical movement’s future. Ecumenical dialogue “is perhaps in danger of becoming a matter for specialists and thus of moving away from the grassroots,” Cardinal Kasper says.
Anyone who has counted nearly as many churches as people in a small town could agree with Anglican Archbishop N.T. Wright’s remark:  “Let’s not fool ourselves that if we can agree around the table in Rome, this solves all problems of church unity. . . . It’s just the beginning.”
2010 is as ripe with evangelistic possibilities as 1910. The Internet and the global economy are a railway for ideas and people such as the world has never seen. It’s time for all who love ecumenism to pick up the flag of the World Missionary Conference—“the evangelization of the world in this generation”—to seize on opportunities created by fruitful dialogues and bring the ecumenical movement back to the grassroots.
The story of the last 100 years shows Christian unity coming as the direct result of missionary cooperation, not the other way around. John 17:21 is still the right verse—but read it in reverse: By banding together to help the whole world believe, Christians from every denomination might just fulfill our Lord’s great prayer, “that they may all be one.”
Bold missionary action launched the ecumenical movement. The same can see it through to 2110."

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
When David Zimmel heard a knock on his door in the middle of the afternoon, he had a pretty good idea who it was—Jimmy, an 11-year-old neighbor boy who often comes over. (David is the head of our Christians in Mission team on the South Side of Indianapolis.)
Jimmy said he wanted a couple of bucks.
David asked, “What for?”
“A Mountain Dew for my mother.”
“I can’t give you money and we don’t have any pop around,” David said. “But you know what? We could pray for some, and God could give it to you. If God wants you to have some pop, he’ll take care of it.”
The two prayed quickly, then they both forgot about it.
The next day, Mary Claire Busk, also a member of the CIM team, called David from the pottery shop where she works. She asked, “Do you want some soda?”
“How much?”
“Lots,” Mary Claire said, “Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Diet Pepsi, the good stuff.”
The shop had received a new delivery and wanted to get rid of their older cans. “I brought home cases and cases,” Mary Claire said, “maybe 300 cans.”
“We managed to give half of it away immediately,” says David, “making sure a case of the Mountain Dew went to Jimmy and his mom, and the diet soda to some diabetics we know.”
A few days later, David was visiting Jimmy’s family and wound up talking to Jimmy’s Dad about praying for healing. Jimmy’s Dad had a hard time believing that God could heal someone.
“I brought up that God could even answer prayers for Mountain Dew,” David remembers.
“Yeah,” Jimmy chimed in, “it works for me.”"

						Branches  |  7 Comments",Permanent Link: In South Bend Two Fires in One Year,"By Sean Connolly
A fire severely damaged the home of Larry and Valerie Day (South Bend) on September 10. The blaze melted pots and pans, burned through walls and destroyed part of the roof. The home’s inside is mostly ruined, but its brick exterior is intact.
Fortunately, no one was inside the house when the fire started. Larry, Valerie and their son Caleb, a senior at Trinity School at Greenlawn, saw smoke billowing from roof vents after returning home late in the evening from a Trinity School event.

The fire came 10 months after a smaller, smoky fire ruined furniture and damaged the hardwood floors in the Days’ combined living room and dining room. The recent fire destroyed everything that was refinished after the first fire. “We’d only had some of the replacement furniture a few months,” Larry says.
Homeless twice in one year, the Days turned to their neighbors and long-time friends Joe and Karen Heintzelman (South Bend). The Heintzelmans had hosted the Days for two months following the first fire, and welcomed them in again, until the Days can move to an apartment, where they’ll stay until their house is fully renovated.
“If there’s a silver lining, it’s that our 1955 house will be brought up to 2010 standards,” Larry says. “Everything will be redone.” Larry expects the renovation to take at least four months.
For the Heintzelmans, welcoming the Days into their house was a natural reaction. Joe and Larry have worked together at the LaSalle Company for more than two decades. “I’m very much like Larry’s brother, part of the family,” Joe explains.
The Heintzelmans also intimately understand the disruptive chaos a fire can cause. In 1994, a fire destroyed the inside of their home, and Joe, Karen and their children lived for about a year in a house owned by the Sisterhood in South Bend. Joe has been advising Larry on rebuilding—drawing on his experience after his own fire and his years as a contractor doing remodeling jobs.

Valerie counts the Heintzelmans’ help as one in a string of blessings. “The day after the second fire was our 34th wedding anniversary,” she says. “Ralph and Pat Rath (South Bend) have an anniversary around the same time, and so they took us out to dinner. That was so special for us.”
Other brothers and sisters offered meals, invited the Days over, laundered the smoke from their clothes and helped the Days inventory possessions.
Larry marvels at how the Lord has cared for his family in tragedy, giving them the chance to stay not just with old friends, but with friends who have been through a life-changing fire and a rebuilding of their own.
“In the community, there are people who have had similar experiences and are really good at understanding your needs,” he says. “My family is the People of Praise.”"

						Mission Work  |  22 Comments",Permanent Link: Hitchhiking On Faith In Southern Indiana,"From left: Peter Putzier, Peter Coleman (obscured) and Rus Lyons return from a hitchhiking trip. Photo credit: Nick Holovaty

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
 The Evansville missionary men finished their third of three hitchhiking trips through the cities and rural towns of southern Indiana in mid-September. In the spirit of Jesus’ earliest disciples, they set out without food or coin. They carried only a few possessions—Bibles, songbooks, water bottles, cell phones and one change of clothes each. They begged meals, rides and places to stay, offering strangers in towns like Chandler, Booneville and Rockport the same prophetic message: God wants to unite everyone in the Mississippi Valley in Christian community.
They came through the trips healthy and with stories to tell—of impromptu prayer meetings held in kitchens and dining rooms, of strangers prayed with for healing or baptism in the Holy Spirit, of fellow Christians who took care of them along the way.
“We never slept outside and we never missed a meal,” notes Rus Lyons, who led the trips, which involved three missionaries each. Along with Rus, Joe Bulger, Peter Coleman, Ryan Hardin and Peter Putzier participated.
All told, the men prayed with more than 15 people to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, led two teenagers to dedicate their lives to Jesus, and witnessed a woman healed of chronic pain. Sometimes the timing of their arrivals was better than anyone might have planned.
In Terre Haute, in mid-July, during their first trip, they dropped by a campus ministry building near Indiana State University, and found six students who had been discussing living together in Christian households. The missionaries proceeded to lead several prayer meetings for students and prayed with one man for baptism in the Holy Spirit.
Later, in the same city, they were knocking on a door when a woman fell from her bicycle and spilled a backpack full of groceries onto her front lawn. “Are you Christians?,” the woman asked as the missionaries helped her pick up the food. “I saw you knocking and knew it was the Lord who sent you.” The missionaries prayed with the woman and her son to be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
Another Terre Haute woman invited the missionaries in for a meal, where they were joined by various relatives and friends. They discussed Christian community and ended the evening singing and dancing together around the dining room table.
Their second trip took them to Washington, Indiana, where a man told them that he had been praying for several months about living with other Christians. He asked to come visit the missionaries in Evansville to learn more about community.
Several people in Washington told them about Matthew, a serious Christian interested in community. The missionaries located his house, where Matthew and his wife invited the missionaries in for a meal with three friends. Later that night the group asked the missionaries to teach them how to have a prayer meeting. All five asked to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and several in the group spoke in tongues.
Later, Matthew called Rus to tell him about the ripple effects. He had prayed with 10 people at his church, and those 10 had prayed with many others in their congregation.
On the third hitchhiking trip, a woman named Angela drove the missionaries to Dale, Indiana (pop. 1,200). As they drank Powerades she’d bought them, they explained their goal of finding people the Lord had been preparing for Christian community. “You’ll find the people you’re looking for today,” Angela said. The men also prayed with her for wisdom in raising her 15-year-old son.
That night, the missionaries were getting hungry and wondering where they would stay. As they walked the streets praying, they came upon a man, Peter, building the framework for a wooden deck. They asked for some food, and Peter’s wife, Carolyn, agreed to make them a meal and to put them up. The men spent their evening helping Peter with his deck and talking with Peter and Carolyn about baptism in the Holy Spirit. Carolyn had already been prayed with, but the men prayed with Peter for baptism in the Spirit and prayed with Carolyn for chest pain, wrapping up their prayers around midnight. Carolyn was feeling well enough to complete a 5K race the next morning.
Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty says the missionaries will likely continue to make short hitchhiking trips. “When the brothers go out hitchhiking, they’re doing it on behalf of all of us, carrying the word of the Lord to the people he loves throughout the region.”"

						Branches  |  11 Comments",Permanent Link: 3 High School Students Join Oahu Branch,"From left: Rachel McCabe, Zach Busekrus and Racquel Kaikanani Leong. 
By Chris Meehan
 Three high school students have come underway in the Oahu branch. Action trips, the community’s music and a desire for Christian friendships all played roles in attracting the students.
Zach Busekrus has many family members in the community. His email address includes the phrase “Busekrus and proud of it,” but he says it wasn’t obvious that he would follow the family tradition. “My Action trip to Indianapolis changed my perspective,” he says. “I saw that the community is trying to make a difference in the world. I wanted to be a part of that.”
He already has some solid experience as a difference-maker. Last year, Zach organized classmates to produce a video on the genocidal violence in the Darfur region of Sudan.  The video, “One Day for Darfur,” combines an interview with a Holocaust survivor and some graphic footage of genocide victims, accompanied by a reggae tune. The video won first prize (out of 500 entries) in the Youth Xchange Video Competition sponsored by Hawaii public television. It also caught the attention of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam, who have helped Zach and his classmates meet some Darfur aid workers and refugees, and have also funded some of their activities.
Racquel Kaikanani Leong hadn’t heard of the community at all until she started tagging along when her mother was working at the parish where the branch meets. She noticed the sound of singing echoing out of the church basement. “There was something about the music that drew me in,” she says. “It was like a calling, and it intrigued me to no end.” She eventually spoke to Mike Busekrus, Zach’s Dad who invited her to a meeting. “I checked it out, and I soon joined Action and loved it.” Racquel traveled to Allendale last summer and came underway in the fall. Her interest in music and songwriting have led her to start writing raps, and she performed one of her compositions at a recent branch meeting.
Rachel McCabe first considered coming underway after seeing the community’s impact on her sister Mary (Servant Branch), now a student at the University of Minnesota. But before making the decision to join herself, she went on two Action trips to Allendale. “Allendale’s day camp and home-repair projects make it a cool place for people my age who love God,” she says. The opportunity for Christian friendships in the Oahu branch also helped draw her in. “People in the community have God in their lives. It’s hard to find people on fire for God at school,” she says.
Oahu branch leader Tom Duddy says he’s grateful that the Lord brought these three students into the People of Praise. “They add enthusiasm and energy to our branch, and that encourages us all.”"

The community’s presence in the Triangle is rapidly increasing. The Triangle is a neighborhood adjacent to the joint campus of Indiana and Purdue University in Indianapolis (IUPUI). A seed planted there by three missionaries in the winter of 2007 is now a growing group of 18, including five freshmen majoring in biology, nursing and philosophy.
“Our goal is to provide a good place for students to go to college, a place where they can study hard, grow in the Lord and live in the community,” says Walt Seale, who leads the effort.
Freshman Chris Walker, a biology major on a premed track, says the urban setting, proximity to major hospitals and the chance to live in a household made IUPUI and life in the Triangle an attractive option for college. “Premed programs are very strong at IUPUI, but the biggest draw for me was common life in household, the Indianapolis branch, and the chance to go to school with a purpose: learning skills to build the kingdom of God.

The five freshmen and Walt and Pam Seale are among 10 community members who have relocated to the Triangle in the past year, and more hope to be on the way soon. Matt and Mary Beth Harris (northern Virginia) have announced their plans to move to the Triangle with their daughter Claire, provided that Matt, a construction manager, can find a job in the area.
The growth has created a housing crunch. One household of ten women is shoehorned into a four-bedroom house with two bathrooms and two refrigerators.
Patricia Brewer, who leads the women’s household, remembers starting out in 2008. “There was always room for guests, always a place to pray, and the bathroom was pretty much always open.” This year the women share bunks and desks, and it’s rare to find an empty room.
On August 21, parents and other friends joined the students to open the Lord’s Day and kick off the year.  The group of 54 people included four men from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who frequently make the hourlong trek to the Triangle for Lord’s Day meals and other gatherings.
A household of 10 women is shoehorned into this four bedroom house.
Community members living in the Indianapolis Triangle are members of the campus division of the South Bend branch. The community also has a campus division in Servant Branch for students at the University of Minnesota.

						Mission Work  |  8 Comments",Permanent Link: For Former Missionaries It’s Back to College,"By Sean Connolly and Chris Meehan

Annie Bulger and Liz Loughran
This fall four former missionaries are returning to college after completing two years of missionary work. For John Bowar, Annie Bulger, Liz Loughran and Claire Mysliwiec, the move from the mission field to the campus quad brings changes large and small: spending long hours on homework that used to be devoted to evangelism, hauling heavy textbooks instead of only a pocket Bible and traveling solo to classes rather than always moving with a small missionary team. So how is the transition going?
“Missionaries go back to school with a more mature vision for their own education,” notes Nick Holovaty, who has observed the transition closely as the program coordinator responsible for the community’s campus divisions. “They’re two years older, and they’ve had two years of experiences outside the classroom, talking with people from every walk of life.”
After wrapping up his missionary work last May, John Bowar traveled first to Minnesota for a summer geology research internship and then to Alaska for two weeks of fieldwork. Camping with researchers in Katmai National Park, John collected 100-year-old samples of volcanic ash, samples that may reveal historical information about the intensity of the earth’s magnetic field.
John Bowar
Like missionary work (knocking on doors), geology work (knocking on rocks) is not always glamorous. “My first assignment was breaking small rocks into smaller rocks,” John says. “That was fine because I had decided to throw myself into my studies with the same intensity I’d had for missionary life.” Now returned from Alaska, John has a bigger course load than ever before (including classes for his geology major), and he’s a member of a busy household of five in Servant Branch’s campus division.
Claire, a junior history major at the University of Notre Dame, says her stint with the missionaries has helped her stay both more focused and more relaxed about her studies. “I’m a lot less concerned about grades than I was before. The reason I am in school is bigger than grades—learning what I can, so that I can serve the Lord.”
For Claire, Annie and Liz, at least one important aspect of their lives in Evansville remains the same. After joining the Sisterhood during their missionary stint and living together in household for two years, all three are household members once again—this time in one of the households of the Sisterhood in the South Bend branch. (The Sisterhood is a group of women in the People of Praise who are single for the Lord and financially in-common, and who live together in several households.)
“The simplicity of household life in the Sisterhood has helped me make a fairly smooth transition back to school,” Claire says. As an added blessing, Claire spent her summer working as an intern in a financial-planning office alongside fellow Sisterhood member Christin Rose.
In addition to taking classes in math and biology at Notre Dame, Annie and Liz are continuing the part-time jobs they held as missionaries. Both are web site developers for one:ten communications, a division of the LaSalle Company that builds web sites for educational publishers.
After two years of talking almost daily with strangers, the returned students report walking around their campuses with a new awareness—that every person they meet is someone the Lord loves.  “I see myself differently,” Claire says. “I have an understanding that the Lord is sending me to people, and that’s on my mind as I interact with students and professors.”
But the returning students are clear about their primary purpose on campus. “The Lord is calling me to be a student,” as Liz puts it. Armed with that call, and carrying with them missionary instincts that may never be erased, the four are working hard to discover how to serve the Lord in their new circumstances.
Editor’s note: Four community members have recently joined the group of missionaries living in Evansville, replacing the four who have returned to college. The new missionaries are Peter Coleman, Mary Grams, Gianna Priolo and Jeanette Zimmel."

						Mission Work  |  5 Comments",Permanent Link: In Evansville A Flat Tire Sparks A Friendship,"By Chris Meehan
Rus Lyons, one of our missionaries in Evansville, glanced down a narrow Evansville street and noticed a young man trying to remove a flat tire with a broken tire iron. Rus grabbed the iron from the missionaries’ car and went over to help the man, whose name was Reese. Fellow missionary Mary Timler stood in the cold, chatting with Reese’s mother-in-law, Tara.
They pulled and yanked and occasionally jumped on the iron trying to loosen the lug nuts. While they labored, Rus told a few healing stories. Reese said he didn’t go to church and had never seen a miracle.
They eventually got the tire off, and then the whole group went into Tara’s apartment to warm up. They met Reese’s wife Octavia and their son Amaria. Then, after a few minutes, Reese began rubbing his knees and grimacing. Squatting in the street had triggered some serious knee pain, a 10 on the scale of 1 to 10, he said.
Rus offered to pray, and when Reese agreed the group laid their hands on him and prayed for a healing. Afterward, Reese straightened his leg, then bent it. He got up and walked around, and then he tried squatting. “Whoa! . . . Wow!,” he said, looking over at Rus. “Thank you, man! There’s no pain!”
Rus and Mary spoke to them about prayer and invited them to pray privately for 10 minutes. Afterward, Reese said he had realized that he and Octavia had never prayed together.
Mary and Rus began explaining baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues, but Reese mentioned that he was skeptical of the healing services he’d seen on TV.
Laughing, Rus pointed at his knee and said, “But what was that that just happened to somebody’s knee?”
“I know that was real,” Reese said.
Reese, Octavia and Tara each said they’d like to be prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, but after nearly three hours of work and conversation Mary and Rus had to leave.
When they came back a week later, they found Tara yelling on the phone. She hung up and started waving her arms around menacingly. “If that woman ever comes over here, I’m going to deck her.”
Mary and Rus helped her calm down and talked to her about Jesus’ words about turning the other cheek. “Getting all upset—that’s what the old Tara would do,” she finally said. “I’ve changed. God saw I was going to get angry, so he sent his angels to show up at the right time, bringing the Holy Spirit.”
All three still wanted to be prayed with to be baptized in the Spirit, so Rus and Mary laid hands on each in turn. “I feel a lot better than when you first met me,” Tara said. Reese said he thought the Lord wanted him to apply for a job—he had recently been laid off. “Whenever you are here, I can’t stop smiling,” added Octavia.
The missionaries have been back to visit a third time.  “I’m hearing God speak to me all the time,” Octavia said. Reese is beginning to talk about some hard changes he wants to make in his life, and he’s getting good advice–thanks to a missionary friend who has time to give . . . and a working tire iron."

By Sean Connolly
Joe Bulger and Mary Timler moved through an Evansville neighborhood dotted with trailers, dirt lots and modest homes. Two women—Bethany and Stephanie—sat on a screened-in porch, talking. The missionaries knew Stephanie already and joined in the conversation.
When the talk turned to cancer, the missionaries told a story from the day before. A woman with osteoarthritis in her neck had been healed of severe pain. “It’s all gone,” the woman had said after they’d finished praying.
As the healing story tumbled out, Bethany looked surprised and then she started talking excitedly.
“I have a friend who has a whole group of Christians living up the street from her,” she said.
Joe and Mary looked at each other. Now they were surprised.
Bethany continued, “They just prayed with her for her shoulder and it was healed.”
Mary made the connection. “Oh, you know LeAnn, too!”
Bethany looked at Joe and Mary. “That was you all?”
Sure enough, a few miles away on the other side of Evansville, the missionaries and LeAnn are neighbors. Bethany and LeAnn are old friends who talk on the phone daily, so LeAnn had naturally told Bethany about the Christians who had invited her over for dinner and prayer meetings, and had prayed with her shoulder for healing.
“Bethany still lives in my old neighborhood,” LeAnn explained to the missionaries later. Then LeAnn agreed to go there with the missionaries sometime and talk with her former neighbors about the Lord.
“When we go through a neighborhood, we don’t always knock on every door,” Mary says. “But the Lord is leading us to the doors he wants us to knock on.
“We aren’t yet concentrating on a single neighborhood for our missionary work. We’re fanning out in different areas and now people in many neighborhoods know us. It’s wonderful to see our efforts bearing fruit across the city.”"

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
A goateed man named Mark motioned Evansville missionaries Peter Putzier and Mary Grams into his house with one hand, pressing a cell phone against his ear with the other. He hung up the phone and launched into the sad story of his last few months: a fall at work leading to an injured back and knees, losing his factory job, separation from his wife and two sons and heavy drinking.
“I’m afraid I’m going to do a really bad thing,” he kept repeating. “You know what I’m talking about.”
Peter had no doubt. He was talking about ending his life.
Peter assured him, “The Lord has sent us to help.”
The two missionaries prayed with Mark for healing of his knees and back, and they cast out evil spirits of fear and despair.
“You can praise the Lord in both good times and bad,” Peter explained. “You can praise God for your two boys, and for keeping you alive so far.”
Mark knelt down on the floor, littered with empty Diet Coke cans and food wrappers, while Peter led a prayer of rededication to the Lord.
Peter and Mary taught Mark a cheerful tune, “The Lord is my light, the Lord is my salvation, the stronghold of my life, whom shall I fear?”
Mark sang it over and over again. “It was the only time I saw him smile that day,” Peter recalls.
Peter returned to the house the next week, this time with missionary Liz Loughran. (Liz has since returned to college.)
Mark said he had been talking to his professional counselors more often than he had before, and he saw hope in the return of his two sons for a visit.
Peter taught him the rudiments of having a personal prayer time, and he and Liz introduced another song. But Mark only wanted to sing “The Lord Is My Light,” and he insisted that the missionaries write down the words.
“You and the other gal saved my life last week,” he said to Peter. “You came at my lowest point.”"

						Tributes  |  1 Comment",Permanent Link: Gen Ficker,"By Elizabeth Kaiser
Genevieve Ficker, of Hastings, MN, passed away peacefully on October 30 at the age of 90. She was born February 22, 1919, in Nicollet, MN. She and Albert Ficker (who died in 1974) were married in 1945 in Hampton, MN, where Gen started her 40-year career as a beautician. After they moved to Hastings, she owned and operated Gen’s Beauty Shop on Fifth Street.
I met Gen 20 years ago and immediately enjoyed her company and her stories, and singing the songs we both knew. She was a frequent guest at our home for meals and celebrations, and we joined with Gen’s family to celebrate her birthdays as she neared 90. When our sons were little, Gen would entertain them while I prepared lunch after a morning’s outing of garage sales. She shared gardening ideas and taught me how to prepare applesauce her way, which we like much better than the store-bought kind. She was patient and didn’t scold when the boys wielded their knives, Rambo-style, chopping the apples that we cooked and canned. I have thanked the Lord many times for sending Grandma Gen to us, because Ed and I both have families who live out of state. Gen’s faith continues to inspire me.
One of Gen’s six children, Pat, along with his wife Patricia and four of Gen’s grandchildren, Laura, Dan, Lisa and Catherine, are members of the People of Praise. Gen came underway October 23, 1983, in Servant Branch, after she retired. She was an avid card player, cook, gardener and seamstress, and she loved to crochet. One day Gen was talking to a social worker at Regina Assisted Living, where she spent her last few years. She told stories about the many 12-hour days she had worked in the beauty shop and how much she enjoyed those years. The social worker listened to Gen for over an hour. Gen had so many great stories–stories that brought us to laughter and sometimes to the point of tears.
She had a wonderful sense of humor. Her response to Bernadette Fossen’s greeting, “Hi, Gen! How are you?” was, “I’m still alive, but I can’t run as fast.” When Gen visited the Fossens she didn’t arrive empty-handed. She’d say, “Hey! I just picked some raspberries from a friend’s place. Here you go.” Gen then sat on a chair in the kitchen and Bernadette would hand her a baby to hold while they talked or while Grandma Gen shared her recipes . . . homemade pie crust or rhubarb sauce. They laughed over Gen’s stories. Bernadette remembers one of the scariest: Gen was driving a streetcar in St. Paul while studying to become a beautician. “One evening, very late, a man boarded the streetcar and said, ‘It’s a good night for a murder.’ Gen put on a brave front and yelled at him to get to the back . . . but in reality she was scared stiff!”
John Fasbender attended grade school with Pat, and admits to being a frequent visitor at the Ficker home. John and Pat were Minnesota Twins fans from a young age, and Gen would graciously drive them and their friends to ballgames in her convertible. He remembers that Gen was able to corral their exuberance and excitement and patiently not lose her cool. John credits her prayers for their eventual coming to Christ years later. Gen’s patience and faith had its impact on them and on others.
Gen persevered in faith as she faced the physical limitations of old age, such as decline in vision, lack of mobility and arthritis. She told Pat, “Jesus will lead me home; you can count on that, Pat.”
Just a week before she died, when a nurse asked if she wanted to see the doctor about a wound on her leg that wouldn’t heal, Gen replied, “No, it is time to see Jesus.”"

						Tributes",Permanent Link: Bonnie Klein,"By Colin Lavergne
Bonnie Knott was born December 19, 1950, in Red Lake Falls, MN, the sixth of 11 children. She grew up on the family farm, and her chores usually involved cooking alongside her mom. She remembered the fun of making tunnels in the huge winter snowdrifts. She was a member of Lake Pleasant 4H Club and enjoyed plants and gardening throughout her life.
She was also a protective older sister, keeping an eye on her younger sisters at dances. When her sister Paulette was an early teen, Bonnie spent extra time with her, telling her how important a relationship with Jesus was.
Bonnie attended Moorhead State University and was working for Hewlett-Packard when she joined the community. Later, when Ken Larsen (Servant Branch) was starting a dental business with other community members, he asked her if she would be willing to work for him as an office administrator. She courageously said yes, leaving the security at her old job to work more closely with brothers and sisters.
When Bonnie joined the community, she moved into Bill and Adella Wacker’s household in St. Paul. She was quite attached to her blue Camaro, and the Lord helped her overcome that attachment as she responded to the needs of the other household members to borrow it. Soon she was leading a women’s group of other singles.
Bonnie sometimes had a mischievous sense of humor. One time, when her mom and dad came to visit her, she told her dad she had made a special sponge cake for him. (She had taken actual sponges, cut them into cake size and then covered them with frosting.) She laughed hard as her dad tried unsuccessfully to cut the cake, and then graciously replaced it with a real one.
Joe and Bonnie Klein were married on January 2, 1981, and soon started a family. She loved her kids passionately and was always involved in their lives.  All three of her kids were avid soccer players, and she was the ultimate soccer mom. She took them to numerous tournaments and did the bookkeeping for one of their soccer leagues. She always spoke proudly about all of them and about their accomplishments.
Bonnie started her own daycare business at the same time she was starting her family and ran it for 16 years. After she closed the daycare, she worked for the University of Minnesota Computer Science Department.
Bonnie’s heart always went out to people in need. She taught her children to pray for people whenever they heard the sirens of emergency vehicles. She held strong beliefs about prolife issues and even had a dream of opening a home for unwed mothers.
She was always interested in world events and liked to discuss big issues. She loved to celebrate birthdays with her women’s group, especially if they went out to eat.
In early 2008, Bonnie was diagnosed with a stage-four brain tumor. She went through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hyperbaric chamber treatments while her husband, children, brothers and sisters, co-workers and People of Praise members rallied around her.  She kept up her sense of humor, even as the effects of the cancer were robbing her more and more of her capabilities.
One result of the cancer was a deepening of the romance between Joe and Bonnie. She often commented that she had never felt so much in love and loved as she did in the last couple of years. During one women’s group meeting at her house, Bonnie wryly noted, “Some guy keeps giving me roses and telling me that he loves me.” When the women teased her about having “a secret admirer,” from the next room Joe called out, “There’s no secret about it!”
She was very adept at finances and had developed a unique system of managing their household finances. As the cancer progressed, it was hard for Bonnie to see her abilities decline, because she had been so very competent for so long.
One of the women in her women’s group recalls the only time she saw Bonnie angry about the cancer was when she was thinking about not being able to share in the lives of her kids and grandkids.
Our Father welcomed Bonnie into his loving arms early in the morning on October 30, 2009. She was surrounded by family, her parish priest and several community friends."

Trish Brewer (left) and Jenny Sergio plant a vegetable garden in the Triangle area of Indianapolis.
 
The Triangle area of Indianapolis wanted fresh vegetables, so this spring Jenny Sergio and Trish Brewer planted a garden—several varieties of tomatoes and peppers in five neat rows behind the duplex. But one Sunday morning in late May Jenny awoke to discover that that their plants had gone missing.
“There were just holes left in the garden,” Trish remembers.
Walt Seale mentioned the purloined plants to Walter, an older neighbor who mows lawns and knows about neighborhood goings-on. “Neighbors just don’t do that,” Walt told him. “We don’t steal one another’s tomato plants.”
Later that afternoon, Walter came to Walt and mumbled a cryptic message: “Walk down the alley and take a look down there on the left.”
Walt followed the alley behind the duplex, but saw no plants.
A few days later, on Wednesday, as Trish walked from her car to the duplex, another neighbor rode up on his mountain bike. A single full beer can dangled from either side of the handlebars, attached there by two six-pack rings.
“I heard about your tomato plants,” he said. “That’s terrible. I don’t like that at all. I’ve got some plants I want to give you.”
“Really? That’s very generous of you,” Trish said.
The man returned with a plastic pot containing three young tomato plants. “I don’t want this kind of thing happening in this neighborhood,” he told her. “We’re all friends here. We don’t want this to be the kind of place where people do that.”
“It sounded exactly like what Walt had told Walter,” Trish remembers.
She thought the plants looked familiar, but she couldn’t be sure. In any case, the Triangle now has a bigger garden than before the heist, thanks to the three tomato plants and some more vegetable plants donated by an Indianapolis branch member.
“We added a whole extra row to the garden,” Trish says."

						Branches  |  2 Comments",Permanent Link: A Surprise Tooth,"By Chris Meehan
Last November, five-year-old Veronica Linczer sat in a small examining room in an Indianapolis children’s hospital, along with her parents Ron and Anne (South Bend) and nine doctors and medical students. Veronica was scheduled for surgery on her cleft palate, until the oral surgeon, the plastic surgeon and the orthodontist got a look at her mouth.
“This is remarkable!,” the doctors kept repeating.
Veronica was born with a cleft palate, though not one that was obvious when her lips were closed. “Inside her mouth, on her upper-right palate, there was a trench-like opening or cleft covered by a clump of skin that should have contained bone and teeth,” Anne explains. “When she smiled you could see the malformed skin in place of one of her teeth.”
When she turned three, Ron and Anne had to decide whether to schedule a major surgery that would graft bone from Veronica’s hip onto her jawbone. If Veronica didn’t have the surgery by the time she turned six, a permanent tooth would not be able to grow in the cleft.
“We delayed surgery to give the Lord time to act,” says Anne. “We invited everyone at our branch meeting to join our family in our daily prayer for healing.”
After praying for more than a year, a baby tooth mysteriously began to poke its way through the folded skin. It took six months to twist and turn into a normal downward position.
The doctors in Indianapolis said they had never seen a tooth emerge from a cleft like that, because there hadn’t been enough bone to support a tooth. An X-ray had revealed new bone growth and another surprise—the shadow of an adult tooth, waiting to replace the baby tooth. A graft was no longer necessary, so the doctors called off the surgery. “It was a true healing,” Anne exclaims. “The gap in her gum line is gone and the cleft is gone. Her palate is in one piece.”"

Commentary
By Sean Connolly
At a February conference in Rome, Catholic Cardinal Walter Kasper made a bold proposal to Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed leaders: “an ecumenical catechism,” a joint commentary on the Apostles Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer.
That was unthinkable 100 years ago, when a group of Protestants met in Edinburgh, Scotland, for a conference credited with launching the ecumenical movement. The president of the conference read a telegram to the delegates from Anglican leaders containing a single, prescient Scripture verse: John 17:21.
Nowadays, every place the word “ecumenism” goes, John 17:21 follows: scrappy local prayer services, papal encyclicals, harangues over the scandal of a divided Christianity. It’s ecumenism’s ubiquitous theme—Jesus’ prayer to his Father—usually shortened slightly: “that they may all be one . . . so that the world may believe that you have sent me.”
A simple logic governs today’s ecumenical movement: unity comes first. Before “the world may believe,” before Christians can achieve the final clause of John 17:21, we must fulfill the first clause, unity. This translates into lots of high-level dialogues aimed at resolving doctrinal disagreements, but not into much common evangelistic effort.
But there’s another way to read John 17:21—in reverse.
It’s startling to look back from today’s dialogue-heavy ecumenism to discover that the 1910 conference didn’t involve a lick of dialogue.
That meeting—the World Missionary Conference—aimed in a different direction. Organizers like Methodist layman John R. Mott saw great promise for spreading the gospel through the expanding network of railroads. They adopted a motto, “the evangelization of the world in this generation,” and let nothing stand in their way. They invited Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Quakers and others to get together and talk, banning dialogue about doctrine, so they wouldn’t be diverted from conversation about missionary cooperation.
Simple logic. In the words of one Baptist newspaper, “The world has to be evangelized. God wills it.”
The logic produced intriguing possibilities, like cooperating in some foreign mission fields, rather than working in parallel along denominational lines. After all, as delegate Cheng Jingyi put it, “Denominationalism has never interested the Chinese mind. He finds no delight in it, but sometimes he suffers for it!”
Tragically, four years later, this boatload of missionary zeal struck a big rock—World War I. The energy devoted to sending missionaries got diverted into a fight for Europe.
But the boat survived, and soon the same churches began talking about unity. Orthodox Christians joined a conversation in 1920 that eventually yielded the World Council of Churches in 1948. At the Second Vatican Council in 1964, the Roman Catholic Church made an irrevocable commitment to ecumenism.
This thread of discussion about unity leads straight to Cardinal Kasper’s proposed catechism, a joint articulation of the basics, relevant to any future missionary cooperation.
But many veterans are concerned for the ecumenical movement’s future. Ecumenical dialogue “is perhaps in danger of becoming a matter for specialists and thus of moving away from the grassroots,” Cardinal Kasper says.
Anyone who has counted nearly as many churches as people in a small town could agree with Anglican Archbishop N.T. Wright’s remark:  “Let’s not fool ourselves that if we can agree around the table in Rome, this solves all problems of church unity. . . . It’s just the beginning.”
2010 is as ripe with evangelistic possibilities as 1910. The Internet and the global economy are a railway for ideas and people such as the world has never seen. It’s time for all who love ecumenism to pick up the flag of the World Missionary Conference—“the evangelization of the world in this generation”—to seize on opportunities created by fruitful dialogues and bring the ecumenical movement back to the grassroots.
The story of the last 100 years shows Christian unity coming as the direct result of missionary cooperation, not the other way around. John 17:21 is still the right verse—but read it in reverse: By banding together to help the whole world believe, Christians from every denomination might just fulfill our Lord’s great prayer, “that they may all be one.”
Bold missionary action launched the ecumenical movement. The same can see it through to 2110."

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
When David Zimmel heard a knock on his door in the middle of the afternoon, he had a pretty good idea who it was—Jimmy, an 11-year-old neighbor boy who often comes over. (David is the head of our Christians in Mission team on the South Side of Indianapolis.)
Jimmy said he wanted a couple of bucks.
David asked, “What for?”
“A Mountain Dew for my mother.”
“I can’t give you money and we don’t have any pop around,” David said. “But you know what? We could pray for some, and God could give it to you. If God wants you to have some pop, he’ll take care of it.”
The two prayed quickly, then they both forgot about it.
The next day, Mary Claire Busk, also a member of the CIM team, called David from the pottery shop where she works. She asked, “Do you want some soda?”
“How much?”
“Lots,” Mary Claire said, “Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Diet Pepsi, the good stuff.”
The shop had received a new delivery and wanted to get rid of their older cans. “I brought home cases and cases,” Mary Claire said, “maybe 300 cans.”
“We managed to give half of it away immediately,” says David, “making sure a case of the Mountain Dew went to Jimmy and his mom, and the diet soda to some diabetics we know.”
A few days later, David was visiting Jimmy’s family and wound up talking to Jimmy’s Dad about praying for healing. Jimmy’s Dad had a hard time believing that God could heal someone.
“I brought up that God could even answer prayers for Mountain Dew,” David remembers.
“Yeah,” Jimmy chimed in, “it works for me.”"

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
A new team of 10 people is carrying forward our city-building work on the South Side of Indianapolis: leading prayer meetings, running men’s and women’s groups, visiting neighbors, renovating South Side homes and prepping for a wave of summer Action teams.
Signs of community life are plentiful:
•    10 to 20 neighbors attend the weekly Sunday evening prayer meeting.
•    Two men’s groups and two women’s groups meet weekly.
•    Five South Side neighbors—three men and two women—are underway in the new start.
•    The community and community members have acquired eight houses, including seven located on  two adjacent blocks.
The members of the  team are now part of Christians in Mission (CIM), a recently reestablished unit of the Mission program office that will focus on building community in new start locations. Team members include experienced South Side residents, missionaries transferred from other locations and members with long experience in branch life.
(Note: Christians in Mission is distinct from the Missionary Company, which sent a team to Evansville, Indiana, in February. The Missionary Company aims to make initial contact with neighbors in a new start locale. Both are units of the Mission program office, headed by program coordinator Nick Holovaty.)
Members of the CIM single women's household take in a baseball game. From left: Angie Hass, Cathy Feehly, Naomi Caneff and Melissa Rader.
 
Mission coordinator David Zimmel is in charge of the South Side work. “For three years, we’ve focused on meeting South Siders and talking with them about the Lord. Now our goal is to form the people we’ve met in Christian community life. Our objectives include teaching neighbors to celebrate the Lord’s Day, to participate in a men’s or a women’s group, to study and pray using the Christian Community Bible, and to join in our weekly prayer meetings.
“Since February our team has formed households and found work to support ourselves. We live in three households, one for single men (Charles Chow, Michael Coney, Nick Raway, David Zimmel), one for single women (Naomi Caneff, Cathy Feehly, Angie Hass, Melissa Rader), and one married household (Ray and Robin Gonzalez). Most team members work full-time jobs; a few work part-time so they can free up hours for neighborhood work.
Michael is overseeing renovations to two of the eight houses in the new start, along with a number of improvement projects on the other properties.  Neighbor Larry “Gill” Gilliam has taken charge of renovating a bathroom in one of the homes. “He heard that we needed help so he started stopping by two or three times a week. He recently asked to come underway,” David says.
Four Action teams will also help with the renovation work this summer.
“I’m looking forward to getting a lot of cleaning and renovation accomplished in the next few months,” David adds. “It’s an exciting and busy transition time on the South Side.”"

						Tributes",Permanent Link: Dick Berg,"by Tom Beckley
A long-time covenanted brother in Servant Branch, Dick Berg of Edina, Minnesota, went to be with his Lord on December 9, 2009, at the age of 70. We all join in our heartfelt prayers for his wife Jackie and their family at this time of loss.
Dick was born in Sauk Center, Minnesota, on July 18, 1939, the youngest of six children. He joined the Navy soon after high school and spent 21 years traveling the globe, but never setting foot on a ship. To the great disappointment of family and friends, Dick would never discuss his activities in the Navy because of his sensitive position in protecting the citizens of the United States and the security of US forces around the world. He’d made a promise not to talk about his work, and he kept that promise. Even when the trusted members of his men’s group would try to pry stories out of him, he remained faithful to his word not to divulge any secrets.
When Dick retired from the Navy he was looking for a place to live, so Jim and Evelyn Bittner, Dick’s brother-in-law and sister, welcomed him into their household. Jackie Thompson, a single mother raising three children, was also sharing household life with the Bittners at the time; she and the Bittners belonged to the Servants of the Light community,which later became the Servant Branch of the People of Praise. She had been involved in prayer meetings since the early days of the charismatic renewal in the Twin Cities, but Dick was not that familiar with community life. Dick and Jackie used to go on long walks together so they could talk (there were a lot of people in the house). It was on those walks that Dick learned more about community (and about Jackie). He told her that “maybe he should look into joining community.” Dick and Jackie also both prayed hard about becoming a blended family (they each had children from a previous marraige). He and Jackie were married March 7, 1980, and for the next 30 years their partnership grew and flourished. Dick made the covenant January 27, 1985. He was always faithful to his weekly men’s group meetings, community and area meetings and service team projects.
Dick had a lifelong affinity for the arts. He did beautiful things with ceramics, designed gardens, and had a special love of photography. He and Jackie attended many theatrical events and classical music concerts. With his keen photographic eye, Dick volunteered a lot of time to document the various cultures on display at the Festival of Nations celebration in St. Paul. In his last years, even as Alzheimer’s robbed him of the words he desired to share at his weekly men’s group meeting, he could still come up with all the words to the songs and hymns we sang.
Aging with gentleness and great love, “Pop” Berg embraced and drew in both his own and Jackie’s children as well as their ever-growing number of grandkids. Dick and grandson Kenny had a special connection. A few months after Dick’s death, Kenny, a special needs teen, placed dandelions in Minnehaha Creek to send on their way to Pop, “because I miss him so much in my heart.”
His daughter Lisa always felt embraced by his love. “Dad looked at life with a different eye than most of us. He showed me that life was a gift and there was always something great around the corner.”
Dick and Jackie loved to travel, and they often included other family members on their journeys. Hawaii was Dick’s favorite place to visit. Son-in-law Dale recounts how, on a trip he took to Hawaii with Dick and Jackie, not a single day passed without Dick contentedly sharing his favorite phrase, “just another day in paradise.”
His second career, after the Navy, was in the retirement branch of the U.S. Postal Service. Dick’s work involved the human resource procedures of processing the information for retirees and helping them understand and gain access to all their postal retirement benefits. At the celebration for his own retirement from the Postal Service, Dick was asked to answer a few questions about himself. One of the questions was, “If you had 30 minutes to talk with anyone in history, who would it be?”
“My father. Only this time I would listen.”
Dick was also asked, “What’s the best time of your life?”
He said, “Today. Right now.”
We thank God for the life and love of Dick Berg, our brother in the People of Praise. He is buried at Ft. Snelling National Cemetery."

						Branches  |  7 Comments",Permanent Link: In South Bend Two Fires in One Year,"By Sean Connolly
A fire severely damaged the home of Larry and Valerie Day (South Bend) on September 10. The blaze melted pots and pans, burned through walls and destroyed part of the roof. The home’s inside is mostly ruined, but its brick exterior is intact.
Fortunately, no one was inside the house when the fire started. Larry, Valerie and their son Caleb, a senior at Trinity School at Greenlawn, saw smoke billowing from roof vents after returning home late in the evening from a Trinity School event.

The fire came 10 months after a smaller, smoky fire ruined furniture and damaged the hardwood floors in the Days’ combined living room and dining room. The recent fire destroyed everything that was refinished after the first fire. “We’d only had some of the replacement furniture a few months,” Larry says.
Homeless twice in one year, the Days turned to their neighbors and long-time friends Joe and Karen Heintzelman (South Bend). The Heintzelmans had hosted the Days for two months following the first fire, and welcomed them in again, until the Days can move to an apartment, where they’ll stay until their house is fully renovated.
“If there’s a silver lining, it’s that our 1955 house will be brought up to 2010 standards,” Larry says. “Everything will be redone.” Larry expects the renovation to take at least four months.
For the Heintzelmans, welcoming the Days into their house was a natural reaction. Joe and Larry have worked together at the LaSalle Company for more than two decades. “I’m very much like Larry’s brother, part of the family,” Joe explains.
The Heintzelmans also intimately understand the disruptive chaos a fire can cause. In 1994, a fire destroyed the inside of their home, and Joe, Karen and their children lived for about a year in a house owned by the Sisterhood in South Bend. Joe has been advising Larry on rebuilding—drawing on his experience after his own fire and his years as a contractor doing remodeling jobs.

Valerie counts the Heintzelmans’ help as one in a string of blessings. “The day after the second fire was our 34th wedding anniversary,” she says. “Ralph and Pat Rath (South Bend) have an anniversary around the same time, and so they took us out to dinner. That was so special for us.”
Other brothers and sisters offered meals, invited the Days over, laundered the smoke from their clothes and helped the Days inventory possessions.
Larry marvels at how the Lord has cared for his family in tragedy, giving them the chance to stay not just with old friends, but with friends who have been through a life-changing fire and a rebuilding of their own.
“In the community, there are people who have had similar experiences and are really good at understanding your needs,” he says. “My family is the People of Praise.”"

						Mission Work  |  22 Comments",Permanent Link: Hitchhiking On Faith In Southern Indiana,"From left: Peter Putzier, Peter Coleman (obscured) and Rus Lyons return from a hitchhiking trip. Photo credit: Nick Holovaty

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
 The Evansville missionary men finished their third of three hitchhiking trips through the cities and rural towns of southern Indiana in mid-September. In the spirit of Jesus’ earliest disciples, they set out without food or coin. They carried only a few possessions—Bibles, songbooks, water bottles, cell phones and one change of clothes each. They begged meals, rides and places to stay, offering strangers in towns like Chandler, Booneville and Rockport the same prophetic message: God wants to unite everyone in the Mississippi Valley in Christian community.
They came through the trips healthy and with stories to tell—of impromptu prayer meetings held in kitchens and dining rooms, of strangers prayed with for healing or baptism in the Holy Spirit, of fellow Christians who took care of them along the way.
“We never slept outside and we never missed a meal,” notes Rus Lyons, who led the trips, which involved three missionaries each. Along with Rus, Joe Bulger, Peter Coleman, Ryan Hardin and Peter Putzier participated.
All told, the men prayed with more than 15 people to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, led two teenagers to dedicate their lives to Jesus, and witnessed a woman healed of chronic pain. Sometimes the timing of their arrivals was better than anyone might have planned.
In Terre Haute, in mid-July, during their first trip, they dropped by a campus ministry building near Indiana State University, and found six students who had been discussing living together in Christian households. The missionaries proceeded to lead several prayer meetings for students and prayed with one man for baptism in the Holy Spirit.
Later, in the same city, they were knocking on a door when a woman fell from her bicycle and spilled a backpack full of groceries onto her front lawn. “Are you Christians?,” the woman asked as the missionaries helped her pick up the food. “I saw you knocking and knew it was the Lord who sent you.” The missionaries prayed with the woman and her son to be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
Another Terre Haute woman invited the missionaries in for a meal, where they were joined by various relatives and friends. They discussed Christian community and ended the evening singing and dancing together around the dining room table.
Their second trip took them to Washington, Indiana, where a man told them that he had been praying for several months about living with other Christians. He asked to come visit the missionaries in Evansville to learn more about community.
Several people in Washington told them about Matthew, a serious Christian interested in community. The missionaries located his house, where Matthew and his wife invited the missionaries in for a meal with three friends. Later that night the group asked the missionaries to teach them how to have a prayer meeting. All five asked to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and several in the group spoke in tongues.
Later, Matthew called Rus to tell him about the ripple effects. He had prayed with 10 people at his church, and those 10 had prayed with many others in their congregation.
On the third hitchhiking trip, a woman named Angela drove the missionaries to Dale, Indiana (pop. 1,200). As they drank Powerades she’d bought them, they explained their goal of finding people the Lord had been preparing for Christian community. “You’ll find the people you’re looking for today,” Angela said. The men also prayed with her for wisdom in raising her 15-year-old son.
That night, the missionaries were getting hungry and wondering where they would stay. As they walked the streets praying, they came upon a man, Peter, building the framework for a wooden deck. They asked for some food, and Peter’s wife, Carolyn, agreed to make them a meal and to put them up. The men spent their evening helping Peter with his deck and talking with Peter and Carolyn about baptism in the Holy Spirit. Carolyn had already been prayed with, but the men prayed with Peter for baptism in the Spirit and prayed with Carolyn for chest pain, wrapping up their prayers around midnight. Carolyn was feeling well enough to complete a 5K race the next morning.
Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty says the missionaries will likely continue to make short hitchhiking trips. “When the brothers go out hitchhiking, they’re doing it on behalf of all of us, carrying the word of the Lord to the people he loves throughout the region.”"

						Branches  |  11 Comments",Permanent Link: 3 High School Students Join Oahu Branch,"From left: Rachel McCabe, Zach Busekrus and Racquel Kaikanani Leong. 
By Chris Meehan
 Three high school students have come underway in the Oahu branch. Action trips, the community’s music and a desire for Christian friendships all played roles in attracting the students.
Zach Busekrus has many family members in the community. His email address includes the phrase “Busekrus and proud of it,” but he says it wasn’t obvious that he would follow the family tradition. “My Action trip to Indianapolis changed my perspective,” he says. “I saw that the community is trying to make a difference in the world. I wanted to be a part of that.”
He already has some solid experience as a difference-maker. Last year, Zach organized classmates to produce a video on the genocidal violence in the Darfur region of Sudan.  The video, “One Day for Darfur,” combines an interview with a Holocaust survivor and some graphic footage of genocide victims, accompanied by a reggae tune. The video won first prize (out of 500 entries) in the Youth Xchange Video Competition sponsored by Hawaii public television. It also caught the attention of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam, who have helped Zach and his classmates meet some Darfur aid workers and refugees, and have also funded some of their activities.
Racquel Kaikanani Leong hadn’t heard of the community at all until she started tagging along when her mother was working at the parish where the branch meets. She noticed the sound of singing echoing out of the church basement. “There was something about the music that drew me in,” she says. “It was like a calling, and it intrigued me to no end.” She eventually spoke to Mike Busekrus, Zach’s Dad who invited her to a meeting. “I checked it out, and I soon joined Action and loved it.” Racquel traveled to Allendale last summer and came underway in the fall. Her interest in music and songwriting have led her to start writing raps, and she performed one of her compositions at a recent branch meeting.
Rachel McCabe first considered coming underway after seeing the community’s impact on her sister Mary (Servant Branch), now a student at the University of Minnesota. But before making the decision to join herself, she went on two Action trips to Allendale. “Allendale’s day camp and home-repair projects make it a cool place for people my age who love God,” she says. The opportunity for Christian friendships in the Oahu branch also helped draw her in. “People in the community have God in their lives. It’s hard to find people on fire for God at school,” she says.
Oahu branch leader Tom Duddy says he’s grateful that the Lord brought these three students into the People of Praise. “They add enthusiasm and energy to our branch, and that encourages us all.”"

						Mission Work  |  12 Comments",Permanent Link: Near Campus in Indy the Community’s Presence Grows,"Fifty-four people gathered for a Lord's Day meal to open the school year.
The community’s presence in the Triangle is rapidly increasing. The Triangle is a neighborhood adjacent to the joint campus of Indiana and Purdue University in Indianapolis (IUPUI). A seed planted there by three missionaries in the winter of 2007 is now a growing group of 18, including five freshmen majoring in biology, nursing and philosophy.
“Our goal is to provide a good place for students to go to college, a place where they can study hard, grow in the Lord and live in the community,” says Walt Seale, who leads the effort.
Freshman Chris Walker, a biology major on a premed track, says the urban setting, proximity to major hospitals and the chance to live in a household made IUPUI and life in the Triangle an attractive option for college. “Premed programs are very strong at IUPUI, but the biggest draw for me was common life in household, the Indianapolis branch, and the chance to go to school with a purpose: learning skills to build the kingdom of God.

The five freshmen and Walt and Pam Seale are among 10 community members who have relocated to the Triangle in the past year, and more hope to be on the way soon. Matt and Mary Beth Harris (northern Virginia) have announced their plans to move to the Triangle with their daughter Claire, provided that Matt, a construction manager, can find a job in the area.
The growth has created a housing crunch. One household of ten women is shoehorned into a four-bedroom house with two bathrooms and two refrigerators.
Patricia Brewer, who leads the women’s household, remembers starting out in 2008. “There was always room for guests, always a place to pray, and the bathroom was pretty much always open.” This year the women share bunks and desks, and it’s rare to find an empty room.
On August 21, parents and other friends joined the students to open the Lord’s Day and kick off the year.  The group of 54 people included four men from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who frequently make the hourlong trek to the Triangle for Lord’s Day meals and other gatherings.
A household of 10 women is shoehorned into this four bedroom house.
Community members living in the Indianapolis Triangle are members of the campus division of the South Bend branch. The community also has a campus division in Servant Branch for students at the University of Minnesota.

						Mission Work  |  8 Comments",Permanent Link: For Former Missionaries It’s Back to College,"By Sean Connolly and Chris Meehan

Annie Bulger and Liz Loughran
This fall four former missionaries are returning to college after completing two years of missionary work. For John Bowar, Annie Bulger, Liz Loughran and Claire Mysliwiec, the move from the mission field to the campus quad brings changes large and small: spending long hours on homework that used to be devoted to evangelism, hauling heavy textbooks instead of only a pocket Bible and traveling solo to classes rather than always moving with a small missionary team. So how is the transition going?
“Missionaries go back to school with a more mature vision for their own education,” notes Nick Holovaty, who has observed the transition closely as the program coordinator responsible for the community’s campus divisions. “They’re two years older, and they’ve had two years of experiences outside the classroom, talking with people from every walk of life.”
After wrapping up his missionary work last May, John Bowar traveled first to Minnesota for a summer geology research internship and then to Alaska for two weeks of fieldwork. Camping with researchers in Katmai National Park, John collected 100-year-old samples of volcanic ash, samples that may reveal historical information about the intensity of the earth’s magnetic field.
John Bowar
Like missionary work (knocking on doors), geology work (knocking on rocks) is not always glamorous. “My first assignment was breaking small rocks into smaller rocks,” John says. “That was fine because I had decided to throw myself into my studies with the same intensity I’d had for missionary life.” Now returned from Alaska, John has a bigger course load than ever before (including classes for his geology major), and he’s a member of a busy household of five in Servant Branch’s campus division.
Claire, a junior history major at the University of Notre Dame, says her stint with the missionaries has helped her stay both more focused and more relaxed about her studies. “I’m a lot less concerned about grades than I was before. The reason I am in school is bigger than grades—learning what I can, so that I can serve the Lord.”
For Claire, Annie and Liz, at least one important aspect of their lives in Evansville remains the same. After joining the Sisterhood during their missionary stint and living together in household for two years, all three are household members once again—this time in one of the households of the Sisterhood in the South Bend branch. (The Sisterhood is a group of women in the People of Praise who are single for the Lord and financially in-common, and who live together in several households.)
“The simplicity of household life in the Sisterhood has helped me make a fairly smooth transition back to school,” Claire says. As an added blessing, Claire spent her summer working as an intern in a financial-planning office alongside fellow Sisterhood member Christin Rose.
In addition to taking classes in math and biology at Notre Dame, Annie and Liz are continuing the part-time jobs they held as missionaries. Both are web site developers for one:ten communications, a division of the LaSalle Company that builds web sites for educational publishers.
After two years of talking almost daily with strangers, the returned students report walking around their campuses with a new awareness—that every person they meet is someone the Lord loves.  “I see myself differently,” Claire says. “I have an understanding that the Lord is sending me to people, and that’s on my mind as I interact with students and professors.”
But the returning students are clear about their primary purpose on campus. “The Lord is calling me to be a student,” as Liz puts it. Armed with that call, and carrying with them missionary instincts that may never be erased, the four are working hard to discover how to serve the Lord in their new circumstances.
Editor’s note: Four community members have recently joined the group of missionaries living in Evansville, replacing the four who have returned to college. The new missionaries are Peter Coleman, Mary Grams, Gianna Priolo and Jeanette Zimmel."

						Mission Work  |  5 Comments",Permanent Link: Action Trip Underway in Indianapolis,"By Chris Meehan
From left: Andrew Kress (northern Virginia), Eddie Pingel (South Bend) and Sam Mertz (South Bend).
Fourteen Action members are in Indianapolis this week repairing homes on the city’s South Side. Team members are mudding joints, installing windows and doors, adding support beams to a teetering garage and hauling away trash and debris.
This trip includes four Action veterans—Don Ferber (Servant Branch), Chris and Geriann Raway (Servant Branch) and Sam Mertz (South Bend)—who have logged 29 trips to Allendale or Indianapolis among them.
I asked them why they keep going back.
“Working on these trips energizes me,” says Don, a retiree who has traveled 12 times to Allendale and Indianapolis since 2003. “It expands my sense of belonging to the community. I have friends throughout the branches that I’ve met from the trips.”
Chris Raway (Servant Branch) is on his fifth Action trip. “I’m a handyman and I can apply my skills,” he says. “It’s fun teaching them to brothers and sisters.”
Geriann Raway (Servant Branch)
 
“You don’t have to be Mr. Handyman to help on these trips,” he adds. “It’s great if you can plumb, install wiring or do carpentry, but if you can’t there’s still plenty of work to do.”
Work like driving the team from place to place, preparing meals, or traveling to the various Lowe’s and Home Depots around town and begging for discounted building materials.
“The life experiences that adults bring to these trips are huge assets,” adds Mike Coney (Indianapolis), who is managing this Action team’s work. “Just knowing what questions to ask about a job and when to ask them can make the difference between success and failure.”
Jim Brickweg, a junior at Trinity School at River Ridge, says he’s grateful for the chance to improve his carpentry skills. “I spent most of this trip putting in doors, which I didn’t know how to do before. I’ve been working with Chris—it’s been great getting to know him. I can tap into wells of wisdom I don’t already have.”
The Action team has a prayer meeting.
 
A Request for More Action Workers
From Mike Zusi, Action Program Coordinator
Brothers and Sisters,
We need more workers on this summer’s Action trips to Allendale and Indianapolis. We need drivers. We need men and women with experience in construction and experience managing projects and people. We need cooks, shoppers and people willing to beg for discounted and donated materials.
The success of our Action teams depends on the volunteers who come on the trips to lead work crews, teach skills and support the summer staff. Take a look at your summer schedule and pray about serving on an Action trip.  Then go to the Action page of the People of Praise website for information on trips and dates this summer.
Thanks to everyone who has served on Action trips, and thanks also for all your support of Action fundraising.  Your sacrifices are bearing great fruit.
In Christ,
Mike"

By Chris Meehan
“Jesus wants us to walk around this neighborhood and talk to Christians about getting to know one another.”
That’s what Evansville missionary Mary Timler told Denise, a home-schooling mother of three on the last stop of the afternoon on Wednesday, April 7.
“The Lord has been speaking to me about unity for five weeks,” Denise replied. “People need to pray and eat together just like in the book of Acts.”
“About five weeks ago, the Lord began telling us the same thing,” Mary said, astonished.
She realized that she and the other missionaries had been praying and thinking hard about John 17:21 (“that they may all be one . . . so that the world will believe that you have sent me”) at the same time that Denise had been studying Ephesians, with its long sections devoted to unity.
Denise invited Mary into her living room along with her missionary teammates, Joe Bulger and Peter Putzier. Kids’ artwork decorated the walls. Denise said that she’d rededicated her life to God several years earlier and had started attending a Pentecostal church. “The kingdom of God is here, and we need to act like it,” Denise said. “Healings should be normal.” Then she told a story about praying that her own asthma would be healed. The Lord healed her, leaving her doctor perplexed.
At the end of a 45-minute conversation Denise offered to have all the missionaries over for dinner or to let them gather for prayer in her house.
Her offer solved a problem for the missionaries. They’d been talking about having a prayer meeting, but several missionaries were feeling sick, so they needed to find a neighbor willing to host the meeting.
Mary called Denise later that day to see if the missionaries could host their meeting at Denise’s house the next evening. “Oh yeah,” Denise responded. “I meant what I said when I said you all could come over.”
The next evening some of the missionaries, Denise and another neighbor prayed with a woman for baptism in the Spirit in one of Denise’s bedrooms. Denise told Mary later that she hoped they could meet for prayer at her house again.
“Living life together should be normal for Christians,” Denise said."

						Mission Work  |  5 Comments",Permanent Link: A Missionary First: Preaching in Song,"Evansville Missionaries Peter Putzier and Catherine Ficker. 
By Chris Meehan
“I think the Lord wants us to praise the Lord and sing a song to them.”
Catherine Ficker was talking to Peter Putzier as the two missionaries approached a one-story home in an older Evansville subdivision with neat lawns and sidewalks. The missionaries sing often in nursing homes and prayer meetings, but they’d never sung unprompted on a front porch before.
Earlier that afternoon, as the missionaries gathered to pray, someone had read a psalm about praising God. In Catherine’s mind, the word about singing fit right in.
A dark-haired woman of middle age opened the door and looked out at them through the screen. “I think the Lord wants us to sing for you,” Peter said, “and you’re welcome to join in.”
The missionaries raised their hands and sang: “If you want to see the victory of the Lord, why don’t you praise him, lift up your hands and praise him?”
The woman stood plain-faced, but her kindergarten-aged daughter swayed and beamed with delight. She seemed to enjoy every note.
“All right, I have to go,” the woman said, as they finished the song.
“Great,” Peter said. “Praise God!”
The woman closed the door.
“That child got it,” Peter said later. “Her appreciation of our song reminded me of what Jesus said about receiving the kingdom of God like a little child.
“I’m sure God wanted us to sing that day. I would do it again if that’s what needed to be done.”"

Lyrics to “Jesus,” by J-T Kelly:
I picture you in dust and heat
I picture you awake at night
You are exhausted on your feet
Crowds to your left and to your right
And up ahead that looming tree
That only you appear to see
Your closest friends don’t understand
The nature of your Father’s plan
I picture you making a choice
A whole new way of life begun
How many people heard that voice
That called you my beloved Son
When you went off alone to pray
For 40 nights and 40 days
Did anyone go search for you
Or wonder what you’re going through
I picture Peter’s furrowed brow.
I picture Martha’s worried mind
You speak as best as you know how
Using every image you can find
To show your Father bright and clear
To everyone with ears to hear
And when there’s no more words to say
You put yourself up on display
I see that ugly stinking hill
I see the blood run down your face
Your mission now will be fulfilled
in nakedness, pain and disgrace
You finally did what you set out to do
In your death, your Father’s love shines through
And then just look at what your Father does for you
Oh just look at what your Father does for you
I picture New Jerusalem
The city founded on your blood
Your spirit fills up every street
Like a river full in flood
Life without end within her walls
Where you are finally all in all
Your Father forever glorified
In your hands, your feet, your side"

						Mission Work  |  7 Comments",Permanent Link: Missionary Work Expands to Evansville,"By Sean Connolly
Fourteen People of Praise missionaries moved from Indianapolis to Evansville, Indiana, on February 17. The move launched what we expect will be our third new start, following Shreveport (2002) and Indianapolis (2007). Evansville, a city of 120,000 in the southwest corner of Indiana, is the first mission location that is not already home to a People of Praise branch.

Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty heads the Evansville team. In Indianapolis, David Zimmel leads a team of 10 missionaries continuing our work on the South Side.
“Our team is large enough and strong enough to split and work in two locations,” Nick says. “We’ve been training new missionaries in Indianapolis for more than a year. Also, Indianapolis branch members are now very involved in our South Side men’s and women’s groups.”
Since February 17, Evansville missionaries have been knocking on doors around the city, delivering words from the Lord, praying with people and looking for those the Lord is calling to Christian community.

A woman told the missionaries that she could only see white light out of one of her eyes. The missionaries prayed once and then she could see shadows. Remembering that Jesus prayed twice for a blind man (Mk. 8:25), they prayed again. Then she said she could see the missionaries clearly with her bad eye.

A young man accepted the missionaries’ suggestion that they pause in their conversation so he could pray privately for five minutes. During prayer, he heard Jesus tell him that he should give his life over to God. He got down on his knees and did it.
A woman who couldn’t bend her knees because of pain knelt down on the ground in prayer after the missionaries prayed with her. Her pain was still gone a week later.

“Missionary work is physically and mentally taxing, and there are definitely moments of joy,” Nick says. “Some of that joy comes when people dedicate their lives to the Lord, and some of it comes when people laugh at us like they laughed at Jesus at Jairus’s house.” (Mk. 5:40).
The missionaries rely on God to supply some of their basic needs. They eat and live simply. Working odd jobs one day a week is sufficient to cover the rest of their living expenses.

The team lives in two adjacent rented houses half a mile from the University of Evansville. The manager of the houses gave them their first local job. After seeing how well they had cleaned the houses, he offered them work cleaning and renovating his other properties.

“Before moving to Evansville, we made preliminary trips to a number of cities, including Memphis, Louisville and Evansville,” Nick says. “Lots of people in and around Evansville were willing to listen to us and they asked us to come back. We’re glad we did.”

Tuesday in Indianapolis, Action division members cut down a tree, removed a fence and began filling a large dumpster—kicking off the ninth summer of Action division work. Team members began arriving on Monday—15  volunteers from four branches: Corvallis, Shreveport, Servant Branch and northern Virginia.
This summer’s schedule calls for four Action trips to Indianapolis and three to Allendale. The first Allendale trip arrives in Louisiana on June 21.
“There’s a lot of work to be done in both places,” says Action program coordinator Mike Zusi. “In Allendale, we’re going to run a camp for six weeks and do another round of home repair projects for our neighbors. In Indy, we’re cleaning and renovating properties for use in our community building efforts on the South Side and in the Triangle area near IUPUI.”
Walt Seale is directing the Indianapolis work, while Nathan Barrett will direct the work in Allendale.
Members of the first Indianapolis team will dig a trench for a new water line on a South Side home, lay carpet in two homes, untangle a maze of pipes in a Triangle home and clean a house in preparation for occupancy by campus division members next fall.

Mike Zusi says it’s not too late for volunteers to apply to attend one of this summer’s trips. Trip information is available on the Action web site, or volunteers can call Action administrator Jeanette Zimmel, 318-208-1124.
Members of the first Indianapolis team include: John Taylor and Ken Taylor (Corvallis); Andree Louvierre, Mary Jane Parker, Gabriela Bendele and Mark Bendele (Shreveport); Willie Forbes and Bruce Brand (northern Virginia); Elena Radtke, Sean Hagens, Martha Mertz, Lizzie Stauble, Don Ferber, Dick Stauble and Linda Stauble (Servant Branch).

   Evansville missionary Peter Putzier
“I’ve got to sit down—I’m in so much pain,” said Tim, a 25-year-old man with a long white cloth wrapped around his rib cage. He had broken two ribs and torn some of the muscles in his right shoulder in a car accident. It hurt to breathe, and he couldn’t stand up straight without pain.
As Tim sat on his front porch, Evansville missionaries Peter Putzier and Mary Timler started a conversation about the importance of hearing the Lord and responding quickly to what the Lord says.
“I can tell that you both have a relationship with God,” Tim said. “No offense, but I wouldn’t have kept talking to you if I hadn’t seen that.” Five days earlier, at church on Easter Sunday, Tim had rededicated his life to the Lord. He claimed he could “talk your ear off about the Lord.”
He also said that his rib cage hurt at an eight on a scale of one to ten, but when Mary and Peter prayed with him, he said the pain dropped to a two.
“Can you take off the binder?,” Peter asked him.
Tim’s eyes widened as he removed the white cloth, expecting a stab of pain at any moment.
“I can’t believe this.”  Tim began gingerly probing his ribs through his T-shirt, but he couldn’t cause any pain to flare up. He looked at his friend James, standing nearby.
“You’ve seen me the whole time,” Tim said. “I couldn’t take that thing off without grimacing before.”
Tears welled up in his eyes. “Thank you, God! Thank you, God!”
Peter suggested that Tim try singing, which requires deep breathing. Tim easily joined in a chorus of “Our God Is an Awesome God,” then he stood up straight and cried out, “The pain is gone. I’m so glad you came over here today.”
Peter asked Tim if he’d like to join them for missionary work the next day. Tim agreed and spent 90 minutes talking to neighbors and sharing the story of his healing. “At one point we ran into an old friend of his, and Tim was excited to talk about the Lord with him, even offering to pray with him,” Peter says.
When they started the day’s missionary work, Tim’s abdominal binder lay in the same spot on his porch where he had dropped it the day before."

Nick
After getting six or seven doors shut in their faces, South Side missionaries Rus Lyons and Catherine Ficker came to a house Rus knew well: Nick and Bonnie’s place.
Typically, Bonnie would come to the door and offer friendly conversation while Nick stayed quietly in the background. One time a missionary had encouraged Nick to forgive his father and follow Jesus, but Nick had insisted that he wasn’t ready.
Nick answered the door this December day. A former coal miner from West Virginia, he stood on the top step wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. He had jet-black hair, a deep voice and thick glasses. He feared going blind and losing his driver’s license.   He had some news. “I forgave my father,” he told Rus.
Then he started in on his familiar refrain: “I’m not ready to follow the Lord.”
“What would following the Lord look like to you?,” Rus asked.
“Giving up smoking and too much TV, plus attending church,” Nick said.
Rus pointed out that Nick was already following the Lord. It was Jesus who had inspired him to forgive his father.
“Nick, God wants to heal your eyes,” Rus continued, “but on one condition. You can’t say you aren’t ready to follow him—you already are!
“Tomorrow, when you get up, your eyes won’t hurt and have build-up on them. This will be a sign to you that you are ready. And don’t worry about how your whole life will change, just pray and fast and ask the Lord what you should do next.”
As Rus and Catherine prayed over Nick, he looked up and down Alabama Street. “Wow! I can see,” he said. “Really. It’s amazing.” He squinted and read the words on the cover of a Bible.
The next day, when he woke up, the film and pain in his eyes were still gone. He prayed like Rus said, and the Lord told him that he should go out in his yard and rake the leaves. The day after that, his eyes remained painless, but he couldn’t read anymore.
Rus and Catherine came back to visit him several more times, praying for his eyes each time. His pain is still gone and now he can read the large type again.
“He’s excited to see us now,” Rus says. “And he doesn’t say that he’s not ready to follow God.”"

LaTanya, an eight-year-old Allendale girl, was hopping mad when she got into the car for her ride to school on a recent morning. Her drivers, Allendale missionaries Jeanette Zimmel and Cathy Grill, saw a brownish circle about the size of a quarter on the back of her yellow uniform shirt—a dried stain from oily hair gel.
As they approached the school, Jeanette asked LaTanya if she wanted to pray for anything that morning.
“Can we pray for the stain?,” LaTanya asked.
Jeanette and Cathy prayed three times. The stain didn’t disappear, but they told LaTanya to keep asking God to remove the stain by the time her first class began.
Later that day, one of LaTanya’s friends told her that something seemed different about her appearance. She’d seen the stain earlier, but it wasn’t there any more. LaTanya rushed to the bathroom to check the back of her shirt in the mirror. Her friend was right: no stain.
The next day, LaTanya told Cathy and Jeanette what happened.
“You can be sure God loves you,” Jeanette said. “He took that stain away.”"

Joe Bulger and Robert
 
Missionaries Peter Putzier and Joe Bulger (Indianapolis) were rapping on the door of a small South Side home, when Robert, a trim, 6’2’’ young man, turned the handle.
“Repent, for the kingdom of God is here!,” Peter said, delivering a message he’d received in prayer that morning.
Robert nearly cut him off. “Oh man, I had a dream about you guys!”
The night before, in his dream, he had seen two men come to his door: two men who looked exactly like Peter and Joe. Robert had been unable to speak in the dream, but he talked eagerly with the missionaries
Robert’s friends, a man and two women, joined the conversation,
asking questions about predictions that a world-altering tragedy is coming in 2012 and whether it’s okay to smoke marijuana since God made it.
“God made bears too, but they’re still dangerous!,” Peter replied with a smile.
After half an hour of talk, Peter addressed Robert directly: “What are you going to do about the dream? What’s your next step?” Robert said that his mother wanted him to go to church again. He said he’d take her the next day.
“Robert was in awe that we were there,” Peter remembers. “He recognized the hand of God.”
A couple of weeks later, Peter and Joe went back to see Robert. He had gone to church the Sunday before. He also said he wanted his newborn son to grow up knowing about the Lord. “It was clear that what we had talked about during our first visit was on his mind. The Lord had definitely paved the way for us!”"

						Tributes",Permanent Link: Dave Temeles,"By Bill Crimmins
Editor’s note: Dave Temeles, father, grandfather and beloved husband, brother and friend, was a founding member of the northern Virginia Branch of the People of Praise, where he served for many years as a coordinator, teacher and head. Dave was born September 5, 1938, and died July 21, 2009. 
“For a long time my dad was searching for the truth, reaching out to God, but confused,” says David Temeles, Jr. He is speaking at the wake service for his father, David Abram Temeles. “Born to a Jewish father and a Christian mother in the late ‘30s, my Dad was raised in a secular household. As an adult, he was reluctant to choose a faith, not wanting to insult the heritage of either parent, but one Sunday he could no longer put off a choice. He was faced with the recalcitrance of an uppity six-year-old who refused to go into the church, objecting, ‘Why should I have to be a Catholic, if you’re not?’ Dad realized that indecision was no longer acceptable. Turning to the Lord for an answer, he had a vision– the faces of countless holocaust victims, who seemed to be saying, ‘How can you reconcile our suffering with faith in God? How is it possible? Where was he then?’ And then the Lord’s face was among them, asking my father, ‘Will you trust me?’ My father decided then and there that he would trust the Lord, and the rest of his life was witness to that trust.”
David Jr. wraps up his sharing and there are many others waiting to take their turn. Charlie Fraga, a friend and brother who has flown in from Portland, wades through the crowd and steps to the microphone.
It is a typical sultry mid-Atlantic summer evening. The hall at Murphy’s Funeral Home is crowded, the air-conditioner’s capacity to cool the air has been overwhelmed and warm, moist air blows around the room. There are not enough places to sit. Adults stand and watch, listening, shifting their weight from foot to foot. Even the kids, who would normally be running up and down in the hallway outside, are still, subdued by the temperature and the closeness of the air. People are tired. But in spite of their discomfort they stay because they have come to see and hear and to remind themselves. They stand, and perspire, fanning themselves. They listen and watch. They are children, friends, children of friends, former household members, brothers and sisters who lived life in common with Dave in the northern Virginia branch of the People of Praise, indeed, who would not have had a People of Praise branch to share life in, had it not been for Dave’s efforts in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s to find Christian community.
Charlie says, “Without Dave, the People of Praise would not be what it is today in the D.C. area. I will go even further: There would not be the People of Praise here today were it not for Dave Temeles. Dave (with his wife, Kathy, of course) had an absolute passion for Christian community. A loose network of Christian relationships was not enough, a prayer group was not enough, a strong evangelistic outreach was not enough. He wanted full-blown Christian community life and he would not settle for anything short of that. . . . ”
Charlie rejoins the crowd and our minds wander a bit in the blur of heat, but the next sharing is another fond memory which reels the attention back. Jenny Nolan recalls the hospitality that was one of the defining characteristics of the Temeles home as she recounts what it was that drew her to live in household for three years with Dave, Kathy, and their daughter Jessica:
“In those days their house was swirling with young adults and their dinner table was the place to be. The food was great, and the conversation ran deep, and it was often very lively. I don’t remember that Dave spoke all that much, but when he did everyone wanted to hear what he was saying. . . . He was a good man, but hard to describe because he didn’t take up a lot of space. He didn’t fill up the room with his presence. Instead he had this very, very deep reserve of calm. It was incredibly attractive. If you were in his corner of the room you wanted to hang on his every word. Oh, he was warm, and he was funny, and he was not the slightest bit opposed to teasing me or anybody else. . . .”
Jenny is right. Dave was a gentle, humble man. I know this well because, just as he was for many other brothers in the branch over the years, Dave was my patient, concerned, sympathetic, wise and attentive, loving and nonjudgmental head for several years.
It is my turn at the microphone and I tell the crowd, “Dave had a way about him, a gift. I would always come away from a talk with Dave a little less frazzled, a little more intact, a little more hopeful, a bit of my life’s tension defused. Coming out the front door of his home and walking across Jackson Street, my step would be a little lighter. Sitting down into the driver’s seat of my car and heading home, I’d be a little more confident about facing the challenges of a life filled at times to overflowing. Idling, and waiting for the light at Marshall and Lee Highway, I’d laugh again, thinking about the laughter that had punctuated our conversation, and feel more confidence about the curious challenges of riding herd over the complex relationships of a full and busy household. . . .”
Back in the crowd, I take off my jacket, roll up my sleeves, and loosen my tie as Therese McNichol shares about Dave’s faith and praying with her friend for healing.
“During the time he battled cancer, Dave experienced many healings that many of you probably never heard about. On at least three occasions that I can remember, he came very close to going on dialysis, but after we all prayed, his lab results would come back normal and it wasn’t necessary. He was also healed of tumors and pain, and his blood sugars came under control. Recently Tom and I prayed with him because he was having a lot of pain in his back, and the pain never returned. And there were many other healings that he experienced over time. I used to suggest to him that he write them all down so others could be encouraged by the power of God. It was because of our prayers, all of us here, that Dave experienced so many healings. Ongoing prayers for healing do make a difference and should be a regular part of our lives. And I think that’s what our Father wanted us to know. . . .”
Much more than this is said, and it is all good. The evening is winding down as Quentin Horneman steps to the front of the room and begins to talk of Dave’s long-suffering nature and his friendship. Dave died of complications from renal cancer and was increasingly homebound the last years of his life, so “. . . he really enjoyed it when people stopped to visit. I loved to go by and visit with my bighearted friend. He always acted like he was happy to see me, he let me tussle his hair, tell him I loved him and then he would tease with me in his good-natured way. He was never negative or grumpy. He didn’t complain. He lived to enjoy his people, and I am so glad I was one of the people he knew and loved. I will miss my friend. . . .”
The microphone is quiet. People begin to file out. They say their good-nights to Kathy, and Jessica, Melissa and David Jr., to Maggie and Michael, and the grandkids.
Yes, we will all miss him, Quentin. We will all miss him.
Until we can be with him again."

						Tributes",Permanent Link: Paul Korkowski,"By Jerry Wind
Servant Branch gathered October 19, 2009, with the Korkowski and Seeger families to honor the memory of a beloved brother, nephew and friend, Paul Korkowski, who died tragically in a car accident on October 14. Paul was a faith-filled, generous and intelligent brother in the Lord. We miss him and will remember him for his deep love of family and his dedication to life in the People of Praise.
Often Paul had a twinkle in his eye. Usually rather quiet in a group, he still gave you the impression that he had a better grasp of what was happening than he let on. His gentle smile indicated that he’d definitely have something to say if prodded, and you would learn a lot if you listened to what it was. The shock of his sudden death was tempered by our celebration of his heroic and loving life.
Paul was born August 23, 1962, the fifth of five children, and his father died when Paul was just two weeks old. His mother eventually moved the family from St. Paul to the home of her brother and sister-in-law, the Seegers, on a farm near Hastings, Minnesota. The Korkowskis and Seegers became a blended family of 12 children, including his seven Seeger cousins. Paul was in the fifth grade then, and still the youngest. He loved soccer and adventurous walks down to the Mississippi River. There, the kids swung on vines across the gullies and uncovered fossils in the dirt. The family grew their own sweet corn each summer and sold it at a vegetable stand, with Paul usually filling the role of banker. Through the hard work and the horseplay of a joy-filled farm life, Paul came to cherish his four siblings and all his cousins. They were one big family. This love and acceptance that he received and gave came to define Paul.
Paul attended Hastings High School, and Tom Caneff clearly remembers inviting him to the Life in the Spirit Seminars and praying over him to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. It was a memorable event for Tom; he was struck by young Paul’s sincerity and purity of heart.
Paul attended the College of St. Thomas and then graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Ph.D. in organic chemistry. When talking chemistry, this quiet, reserved man could easily and comfortably speak to a group of 100 people. John Zimmel, a friend of Paul’s and a member of his men’s group who was also a chemist, recalls how he and Paul would sit at a Bruegger’s bagel shop discussing things like urethane catalysts and drawing chemical structures on napkins. Paul had a good memory and a sharp mind. He worked at 3M for 13 years, and more recently at a veterinary pharmacy in St. Peter, Minnesota, where his nickname was “Doc.”
Despite working about 70 miles from the Twin Cities in recent years, Paul kept his condo in St. Paul so he could attend Servant Branch meetings and activities. He would also see family and friends and connect with his men’s group on the weekends. The effort he made to stay connected exemplified Paul’s committed life. His sister Kathy Korkowski (Servant Branch) says she will miss him coming to her house for weekend dinners. Also, she and Paul often drove together to visit the Korkowski relatives, whom they hadn’t seen very often while growing up, which helped them all to became closer as adults.
Phil Korkowski (Servant Branch), Paul’s only brother, recalls fishing, canoeing and camping together. One time, camping at Leech Lake, they were trying to sleep in their tent and thought they heard a lawnmower outside. No, it was the sound of the “Minnesota state bird,” mosquitoes. Phil fondly recalls their mutual amazement with a good laugh. Paul loved portaging through the Boundary Waters in northern Minnesota and also regularly went to rented lake cabins for long weekends and family vacations. This past June found him halibut fishing in Alaska with a high-school friend.
Paul played an important role in the lives of many different people. At one point he owned a large house, so he provided a gathering place for the Seeger and Korkowski clans. He never missed a family function. His niece Emily remembers Paul’s kindnesses to her: “When my parents couldn’t, he helped pay for my braces and orthodontic work. One Christmas he gave me an old car, and on my first wedding anniversary he gave me a card that said, ‘Hey, Emily, do you know the difference between a light bulb and a niece? A light bulb can be replaced.’”
No one can replace Paul for his family or his brothers and sisters in the People of Praise. His sister Rose stated that Paul had a heart of gold and lived his life following in the footsteps of Jesus. We commend our brother Paul, this generous, intelligent, thoughtful, faithful man, to the Lord who always loved him."

						Tributes",Permanent Link: Gail Lee,"By Mary Lee
Snow covered the quiet cemetery as Gail Lee’s family gathered on December 30, 2009, to pray and celebrate her life on what would have been her 64th birthday. The snow reminded us of her youthfulness. If she had still been with us, she would have been frolicking in the snow with her grandchildren, making snow angels and snowmen.
When I became engaged to Gail’s son John, a dear friend of mine who had known John’s parents for years told me, “Mary, Carmen and Gail are just the salt of the earth.” It didn’t take me long to learn what that meant. They knew how to live in a way that made life just taste better to everyone around them.

Gail met the boy who was to become the love of her life when she was five years old. (Carmen was four at the time.) The relationship got off to a somewhat rocky start when Carmen signed Gail’s grade-school autograph book with a boyish taunt. Gail didn’t take that too much to heart, and by the end of high school she was very much in love with him.
They were married right after Gail finished her undergraduate degree and they moved to a dormitory of the North Dakota School for the Deaf, where Carmen began as a teacher and later assumed the directorship. Soon their family began to grow, with the births of John, Travis and Aaron.
In the early 1970s, when charismatic renewal was sweeping across the Catholic Church in the U.S., Gail was touched in a new way by this wave of the Holy Spirit. She began attending prayer meetings and asked Carmen to join her.
They soon felt the call to Christian community and moved to the Twin Cities to join Servants of the Light, a community which later became the Servant Branch of the People of Praise. This was a sacrifice for both (it was a downward career move for him, and Gail had to leave behind her enormous, abundant garden), but they both knew it was what God wanted.
They plunged into life in community. Gail once shared with me that community life had greatly improved their marriage, and their relationship as a couple bore much fruit for the community. They made the covenant of the People of Praise on January 27, 1985.
Gail sometimes came across as a quiet woman, but the women in her area and women’s group knew her strength. During the years that Carmen served as a coordinator, she freed him to serve by making sure their home life was working well. She was a sister and friend to the women who lived in household with them, and she did untold hours of work every summer preparing for Servant Camp (which Carmen led): organizing fundraising events, arranging tent-mates, preparing medical forms and much more.
Even beyond her love for community, Gail was devoted to her four children. She went to many of her kids’ soccer games, in both high school and college. For years, Gail trudged through the winter snow with Carmen and the boys on their morning paper route, which helped pay for sports and education fees. When their daughter Cynthia was in grade school, Gail took on work at a nearby dance studio so that Cynthia could attend lessons there, and spent hours selling Girl Scout cookies and organizing a garage sale to raise money for Cynthia’s People of Praise Girl Scout troop to visit the branch in Hawaii.
Gail was willing to sacrifice so that her family and others would not have to do without. For her, people and relationships came first. Her sacrifices for others didn’t end when she found out that the cancer she’d beaten several years before came back in 2009. Gail and Carmen made a firm decision not to live or act as if she had a terminal illness. They continued to live as normally as they could, spending Thursdays with their grandchildren, and watching my kids every day at our house while I taught a class at Trinity School. Gail continued making monster cookies for her grandkids, went to her oldest grandson’s soccer games, and helped her daughter deliver her sixth grandchild only a month before she died. In fact, if you had called their house last summer, you might not have known that anything was different, because, as Gail always put it, they were “deep into camp,” which meant they were working on Servant camp from the time they woke up pretty much till the time they went to bed.
On September 14, the day she died, Gail’s breathing was very labored. As I watched her gasping for breath, I thought of Jesus, who also had poured out his life in love for us. Even her posture reminded me of Jesus on the cross. As Gail mirrored him in her life, so she mirrored him in her death."

						Mission Work  |  5 Comments",Permanent Link: In Evansville A Flat Tire Sparks A Friendship,"By Chris Meehan
Rus Lyons, one of our missionaries in Evansville, glanced down a narrow Evansville street and noticed a young man trying to remove a flat tire with a broken tire iron. Rus grabbed the iron from the missionaries’ car and went over to help the man, whose name was Reese. Fellow missionary Mary Timler stood in the cold, chatting with Reese’s mother-in-law, Tara.
They pulled and yanked and occasionally jumped on the iron trying to loosen the lug nuts. While they labored, Rus told a few healing stories. Reese said he didn’t go to church and had never seen a miracle.
They eventually got the tire off, and then the whole group went into Tara’s apartment to warm up. They met Reese’s wife Octavia and their son Amaria. Then, after a few minutes, Reese began rubbing his knees and grimacing. Squatting in the street had triggered some serious knee pain, a 10 on the scale of 1 to 10, he said.
Rus offered to pray, and when Reese agreed the group laid their hands on him and prayed for a healing. Afterward, Reese straightened his leg, then bent it. He got up and walked around, and then he tried squatting. “Whoa! . . . Wow!,” he said, looking over at Rus. “Thank you, man! There’s no pain!”
Rus and Mary spoke to them about prayer and invited them to pray privately for 10 minutes. Afterward, Reese said he had realized that he and Octavia had never prayed together.
Mary and Rus began explaining baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues, but Reese mentioned that he was skeptical of the healing services he’d seen on TV.
Laughing, Rus pointed at his knee and said, “But what was that that just happened to somebody’s knee?”
“I know that was real,” Reese said.
Reese, Octavia and Tara each said they’d like to be prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, but after nearly three hours of work and conversation Mary and Rus had to leave.
When they came back a week later, they found Tara yelling on the phone. She hung up and started waving her arms around menacingly. “If that woman ever comes over here, I’m going to deck her.”
Mary and Rus helped her calm down and talked to her about Jesus’ words about turning the other cheek. “Getting all upset—that’s what the old Tara would do,” she finally said. “I’ve changed. God saw I was going to get angry, so he sent his angels to show up at the right time, bringing the Holy Spirit.”
All three still wanted to be prayed with to be baptized in the Spirit, so Rus and Mary laid hands on each in turn. “I feel a lot better than when you first met me,” Tara said. Reese said he thought the Lord wanted him to apply for a job—he had recently been laid off. “Whenever you are here, I can’t stop smiling,” added Octavia.
The missionaries have been back to visit a third time.  “I’m hearing God speak to me all the time,” Octavia said. Reese is beginning to talk about some hard changes he wants to make in his life, and he’s getting good advice–thanks to a missionary friend who has time to give . . . and a working tire iron."

						Trinity School  |  1 Comment",Permanent Link: New Chair of the Board of Trustees of Trinity Schools,"From the Board of Trustees, Trinity Schools, Inc.:
It is with heartfelt regret that we announce the resignation of Paul C. DeCelles, Chair of the Board of Trustees of Trinity Schools, Inc., but we are delighted to announce the election of Craig S. Lent as the new Chair of the Board, effective April 1, 2010.
Paul has been Chair since the founding of the first Trinity School in 1981.  Under his leadership we have grown from a small school of approximately 40 students, holding class in a rented church facility, to a student body of 700 students, 3 campuses and approximately 150,000 square feet of educational space.  During Paul’s tenure, all three Trinity Schools have won the prestigious blue ribbon award from US Department of Education.  Most importantly we’ve produced 1,500 graduates who have excelled academically, in the performing arts, in civic leadership, and in the service of the poor and needy.
Paul’s passion for learning, and specifically for the unique education of Trinity Schools, along with the vision which he brought to fruition over the past 29 years as Chair of the Board of Trustees is unsurpassed.  “I will miss collaborating with all the leaders of the community of learners,” says Paul, “but I am especially grateful for my long association with Clem Walters, Kevin Ranaghan and Kerry Koller, who have been with me on the Board since the beginning.  I’m also grateful that Craig has accepted this position.”
We will miss Paul, but we support him in his decision to focus his efforts on the burgeoning mission, business and communication activities of the People of Praise.  Please join us in thanking him for his many years of service to the mission of Trinity Schools and in praying for his continuing efforts to serve God and his people.
Together with Paul, we welcome Dr. Craig Lent as the new Chair of the Board.  Craig is well suited for this responsibility.  He is the Frank M. Freimann Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.  Although he is a new member of the Board, Craig has been engaged with Trinity as a parent and as a consultant to our math curriculum reviews.  He is also responsible for the creation of  the brilliant Matlab course of instruction at Trinity and training its teachers. He and his wife, Mary, are the parents of two Trinity School at Greenlawn alumni."

						Trinity School",Permanent Link: Meadow View Seniors Harness Wind Energy,"From left: John Piescik, Joshua Kelly, José Gil-Figueroa, Benjamin Redgrave, Christopher CornettBy Joe Gleason
Five seniors from Trinity School at Meadow View spent their project week building a 14-foot-high windmill on the schoolgrounds.
The idea emerged last November after physics teacher Tim Maloney told a story at morning prayer about a 14-year-old Malawian boy, William Kamkwamba. William studied a physics textbook, then built a windmill from recycled bicycle parts and other salvaged materials.
After hearing the story, seniors Chris Cornett, Ben Redgrave, José Gil-Figueroa, Josh Kelly and Johnny Piescik approached Tim with the idea of building their own windmill during project week. They set to work on a written proposal that included diagrams, materials and cost estimates, as well as an operations manual explaining how each part of the windmill functioned in relation to the whole.
“We wanted to treat this like it was an actual engineering project, not just something hypothetical,” Chris says.
During project week they assembled the structure from lumber, PVC pipe, steel poles and wood paneling, but their efforts to generate power to run a light bulb ran into some hiccups. Their original design called for an automotive alternator to channel the electrical current. After some experimenting, they switched to a more efficient alternative: a bicycle dynamo they bought at a used bike shop. (It converts the energy from peddling into electricity for a bicycle headlight.)
“It was wonderful to watch them do legitimate problem-solving in real time,” Tim says.
The windmill cost about $250 and succeeded in producing power.
“The best part was when we got it working,” Chris says. “We were really disappointed for a while, but finally the windmill started powering the light bulb.”"

						Trinity School",Permanent Link: First Blue Ribbon for Trinity School in Northern Virginia,"From left: Tim Maloney, Aba Kumi, director of the US Department of Education's Blue Ribbon Program and Andrew Zwerneman.
By Catherine Bulger
Trinity School at Meadow View has earned its first blue ribbon award from the US Department of Education. The 12-year-old school was one of only two private high schools in the country to receive the honor for 2009. The award is the sixth for a Trinity School campus.
To qualify, Meadow View students had to score in the top 10% nationally on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Tim Maloney, a math and physics teacher, assembled a 22-page application laying out the case that Meadow View was not just a “good school” or even a “strong school” but a “model exemplary school.” Tim and head of school Andrew Zwerneman accepted the award at a ceremony last November.
The Blue Ribbon Award primarily recognizes academic achievement, but at Meadow View learning is inseparable from a culture of camaraderie, fun and joy in discovery.
Meadow View has a small enrollment—130 students—and a humble campus: four small buildings with not a single room large enough to hold the entire faculty and student body. The large commons area does triple duty as lunchroom, classroom and drama stage, and the soccer field boasts mulch instead of grass. But students and faculty say the modest facilities and the school’s size are big advantages. “We maintain a level of friendship that you might not find in a bigger school,” notes Andrew.
“It’s the perfect size,” adds senior Justin Young. “There’s a huge camaraderie among the classes.”
For dean of girls Jenny Nolan, a typical day at Meadow View begins as she unlocks the girls’ locker room, greets the girls and heads off to morning prayer. “Morning prayer feels very personal,” she says. “On Thursdays and Fridays senior girls help lead prayer. There are only three full-time women on the faculty—if we had to lead prayer ever day, we’d be in big trouble!” The girls often pray for us—the teachers—in our presence.”
Meadow View is the only Trinity School where morning prayer regularly involves chanting. “One or two days a week we actually sing the psalms like medieval monks,” says senior Nathaniel Hlavin. “That’s a fun way to start the day.”
The school has a charism for fun. For example, in the quirky competition called Quest, classes vie for points in a quiz bowl (called Metaphysical Pursuit) and a Ping-Pong tournament. The winning class gets their class year engraved on an oar that hangs in the school, a symbol of “finality and triumph,” Andrew Zwerneman explains. The oar is just like the paddle that the Greek hero Odysseus planted in the ground after completing his heroic quest, described in Homer’s Odyssey.
Meadow View has a serious side as well. When teacher Emily Heidel’s father had an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down, parents brought meals for Emily’s family, and students organized a chili cook-off, raising $3,600 to help with medical expenses.
Kerry Koller, president of Trinity Schools, says Meadow View’s teachers have helped shaped a culture where everyone feels free. “They have a first-rate faculty of terrific teachers who love Trinity School.”
“People here care about what they’re learning,” adds Nathaniel, pointing to his experience studying ancient classics with Humane Letters Seminar teacher Ed Kelly: “It felt like we had just dug up Homer’s ancient manuscript. Millions of people had read it before, but he made it seem totally new. When Trinity uses the term ‘community of learners,’ they’re not lying.”
It’s a community of learners that is also a community of psalm-chanters, of-tug-of-war contestants, of springtime outdoor barbecuers and of numerous athletes: 90% of the students play at least one sport. Of course, learning is at the heart of things, and now Meadow View has a national award to prove that a thriving culture housed in humble confines can get big results."

Ann Thomas
By Chris Meehan
Hip pain woke Ann Thomas (South Bend) at 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, May 2, and kept her awake until daylight. Her right hip has troubled her for years—an orthopedic surgeon and X-rays confirm a diagnosis of arthritis, a condition aggravated by bearing nine children and by chemotherapy treatments for cancer.
Just after 3:00 p.m. that day, when Ann stood for the first song at the branch community meeting, her hip was still throbbing. She knew she would have to change positions often to manage the pain.
Lisa Ficker was standing near Ann, at the front of the same section of chairs. A few weeks before, at a gathering of branch women, the Lord had given Lisa a word of knowledge—he wanted to heal someone’s right hip. She’d never given a word in front of such a large group and she didn’t know that Ann had a hip condition.
Lisa didn’t give the word at the women’s meeting, but she thought of it often in the days that followed. She remembered how her own lower back pain had been healed when someone gave a word of knowledge at a branch community meeting.
 “As the May 2 meeting started,” she says, “I felt the Lord remind me of the word.” She walked over to the chairs by the microphone and soon delivered her short message, “I think the Lord wants to heal someone’s right hip today.”
Then Chris Rowland led the branch in a prayer for the healing.
A few seconds later, Ann felt the pain leave her hip. She shared about the healing later in the meeting. The next morning she spent two hours on her hands and knees gardening at a friend’s house, without experiencing the throbbing pain. One month later, the pain is still gone.
In May, Ann attended the graduations of two of her children, the First Communion of a third, and the wedding of her oldest son Ricky. “It was really merciful of the Father to heal my hip,” she says."

By Chris Meehan
Three women sat on portable stools among the gravestones, laughing and crying as they watched the rays of the evening sun stream through the trees. “You might say it was my great sorrow that brought us there, but I’d say it was really the love of my sisters in Christ,” explains Judy Hickey (Saskatoon).
Judy’s mother died 44 years ago, when Judy was eight years old. Following the custom of the time, Judy and her sister had not been allowed to attend their mother’s funeral services. The pain and anguish from losing her mom grew over the years, but Judy didn’t talk about it very much. Then she brought up her grief at a women’s group meeting.
“Judy, have you ever been to your mother’s grave?,” Janice Akerman asked after hearing the story.
“No. I’m afraid it’ll be too hard. And I don’t even know where she’s buried.”
“We’ll find out. We’ll come and get you next Monday for women’s group and we’ll go with you, if that’s what you need,” Janice said.
The next Monday evening, Suzanne Rooke and Janice rolled up to Judy’s house in Janice’s car. They drove 20 minutes to a large cemetery. Janice found the grave’s location online and printed a map so Judy could find the spot then and in the future.
Janice and Suzanne brought flowers for Judy to place on her mother’s grave. As they sat in the warm sun, Judy shared memories of her mother, the things she missed the most, and how her mother’s death had affected her life over the years.
“As we talked and cried together,” says Judy, “I realized how grateful I was for these women, and for the time and effort we had put into our friendship over the years to bring us to this point. They were God’s provision for me. I found that I could start to face my grief and move along with it, once I had the strength and courage of my women’s group to bolster me. I wouldn’t have wanted to face it on my own.”"

 By Chris Meehan
Tom Evans, the coordinator responsible for the Biloxi, Mobile and Shreveport branches will step down from his position on July 1, 2010. Diane, Tom’s wife, will also relinquish her handmaid-type responsibilities for these three branches.
Mike Coney, principal branch coordinator for New Orleans and a member of the community’s board of governors, will assume Tom’s responsibilities. Linda Coney, principal handmaid in New Orleans, will take up Diane’s work relating to the women leaders of these three branches.
Tom began serving as a mission coordinator in 1987. In 1988, he helped guide the St. Mary of the Pines prayer group in Shreveport through their decision to become a People of Praise mission branch. He and Diane have seen the Shreveport branch through the sudden deaths of two branch leaders, Jim Minto and Pat O’Connor and through the changes that came with the birth of the community’s Allendale outreach in 2002. They helped the Biloxi and Mobile branches recover after Hurricane Katrina scattered members and destroyed homes in 2005. From 1987 to 1999 Tom served as principal branch coordinator for New Orleans.
“Tom has been a fine pastoral leader, good at moving people forward, and he performed brilliantly in a number of difficult situations with his calm and steady presence” says Kevin Ranaghan, head of the branch relations team on which Tom and Diane serve. “And Diane excels in one-on-one pastoral work.”
Cliff Vaughan, Shreveport’s head branch leader, agrees: “I’m so grateful to Tom. He’s continually formed us through weekly phone calls and personal visits, two, three or four times a year—whatever was necessary. Tom always has the right words to say. He knows the Lord and he knows the People of Praise and that’s a great combination. Tom and Diane have been so generous with their time, their wisdom and their sense of humor. Just ask Diane about the rubber cockroaches that sometimes appear in funny places after their visits.”
The Shreveport branch honored Tom and Diane at a Lord’s Day meal during their branch visit in April. Debbie Vaughan said, “When I spend time with Diane, I experience being formed in the community’s ways. For example, Diane doesn’t just know the community’s teaching on right speech. She has the heart of the Lord, his love, for the people she talks about, so of course she speaks rightly about them. I also admire Tom’s integrity.  What he believes is what he says, what he says is what he lives. There’s a wholeness about him.”
At 72, Tom says he’ll manage to stay busy, compliments of Diane’s To-Do-When-Retired List. They also hope to visit branches they’ve never been to. Tom and Diane have two grown sons.
Craig Lent had this to say about the Coneys: “Mike’s extensive pastoral experience and Linda’s years as principal handmaid for her branch make them well-qualified for this work. Mike recently retired from Shell Oil. They’re a wonderful couple with a great family—they’ll do a super job.”"

Pat Hrbacek was appointed to head the Colorado Springs branch on September 10. He follows Louis Grams, who has served as the branch’s head since 2000.
“The vision, pastoral care and guidance Louis possesses have done so very much to build this newer branch,” said Kevin Ranaghan, chair of the branch relations council. “There is no way to express adequately everyone’s gratitude to him.
“Louis has faced health problems in recent years, including a number of surgeries and recoveries. Pat has been serving as the branch’s acting head for a number of months, a job he has done very well. Please pray for Pat as he continues these responsibilities.”
Pat and his wife Kara moved to Colorado Springs from Servant branch in 2000, arriving a few months after the Gramses, who also came from Servant Branch. (Kara is the daughter of Jim and Carol Rolland of Servant Branch). The Hrbaceks have four daughters. In addition to leading the branch, Pat works as an attorney and is a partner in a Colorado Springs law firm. Kara is a stay-at-home mother and part-time high school humanities teacher.
“Kara and I have been the recipients of so much love and service from our brothers and sisters in Colorado Springs,” Pat says. “So it’s an honor and a privilege for me to serve in this new way, especially following Louis, who has been a model servant in this position.”
In 2006, Louis was bending over to work in his garden when some screws in his back (from a previous surgery) came loose, triggering major damage to his autonomic nervous system. He says that doctors understand little about how to repair the autonomic nervous system, but a number of specialists can treat his various symptoms—blood pressure swings, breathing trouble and fatigue among them. He relies on a portable oxygen machine to assist with his breathing.
Louis is quick to add that his doctors have uncovered no connection between his current health problems and the Churg-Strauss syndrome that the Lord healed him of in 1997. He continues to work for Kevin and the branch relations office and he’s a member of the Colorado Springs branch leaders team. He is writing music, and beginning to compile the many musical compositions he has penned over the years.
“When I was sick before [in the mid-1990s] I was so preoccupied with being sick that it was all I could think about. This is a different experience. I feel well some of the time, and when I feel sick I find lots of grace to do what I can do,” Louis says. “The Lord has more for me to do and I’m looking forward to what’s next.”"

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
A violent crisis disrupted life in Kingston, Jamaica, last week as local gangs and government forces clashed. The fighting began after police launched a manhunt for Christopher Coke, a gang leader wanted on gun and drug trafficking charges in the United States. Seventy civilians are reported dead amid rumors of aggressive police tactics and a trail of corruption that allegedly leads to the country’s Prime Minister Bruce Golding, according to multiple news reports. The government declared a state of emergency and has restricted some civil liberties.
The day the conflict boiled over, Sunday, May 23, members of the Kingston branch came unwittingly close to the fighting. Branch members delivering meals to residents near the Tivoli Gardens neighborhood encountered barricades and saw black smoke rising from a burning police station.
“We knew there was a risk of trouble when we set out to deliver food, but we saw other cars driving into the area, so we decided to go ahead,” explains Joseph Mutidjo, a member of the feeding team. “Demand for food was heavier than usual because other feeding groups stayed away.
“Later that day a gun battle took place on the same street we had been on. The Lord definitely protected our feeding team.”
The team handed out 320 meals that Sunday.
As the violence spread, schools closed and many businesses shut their doors. The branch canceled men’s and women’s group meetings and members did their best to stay home. Locksley Robinson nearly drove into a gunfight on his way home from work, but police stopped him and sent him another way.
All branch members are safe and unharmed.
The fighting has subsided this week, though the state of emergency remains in force and Christopher Coke is still on the run.
“It’s a tragic situation,” says head branch leader Vince Keaveny, “the worst I’ve ever seen.”
“We tried to keep a low profile last week,” adds Joseph. “Rumors were flying everywhere, and the situation was fluid and confusing. Please pray for us, and pray that we can figure out how to continue delivering food to the people who need it.”
Editor’s Note: Kingston branch member Sam Davis submitted this first person account of the effort to feed Kingston’s homeless on Sunday, May 23.
Feeding His Lambs in the Lion’s Den
By Sam Davis
Despite the rising tension and concerns for the safety of our teams, we decided that our feeding ministry must go on.  We did not realize that God had already set in motion a plan that would not only grant safe passage for his servants but would deliver more meals than we had ever delivered to the homeless and poor.
The first sign that this was going to be an extraordinary day came when we met to prepare our food.  When the pots we’d used to cook the food were empty, we had packaged a record 320 meals! (We normally distribute 250 meals.)
We held hands in a circle and prayed that God would provide a special cloak of security for us and that he would lead us to the 320 brothers and sisters most in need. We worried that many of the homeless would not be in their usual spots and that there would be meals left over. Nevertheless, we set out on Kingston’s emptier-than-usual streets in search of the hungry.
In downtown Kingston we were happy to see familiar faces emerge to greet our vehicle.  The homeless formed a line, said grace and collected their meals against the backdrop of black smoke from a building set on fire less than two miles away.
“We haven’t seen the others [from other feeding programs],” one lamented as he requested a second meal to have later in the evening.  Suddenly, the purpose of the additional meals became clear.  With the civil unrest, there was no guarantee of when and where the next meal would come from. Many received a second meal until they all were gone!
Soon after we left, the government declared a state of public emergency and sealed off the downtown area.  From television we learned that there were gunfights that day on the very streets on which we stood handing out meals.
That day reminded us that if we are willing and obedient our God is faithful and we need not fear any ill.  We now eagerly look forward to our next feeding program!"

						Branches  |  6 Comments",Permanent Link: Tampa Dispatch: A Sign From God Saves A Life,"Pat Benito (left), Linda Scrofani (right).
 
Editor’s Note: In an interview conducted by Chris Meehan, Rosa, a 21-year-old college student from Lakeland, Florida, describes meeting Linda Scrofani (Tampa) last May, when Linda and fellow branch member Pat Benito were working as sidewalk counselors at a Tampa abortion facility. We’re not using Rosa’s real name.
On May 12, 2009, I found out I was pregnant. I was living alone and going to college. My father is a strict man. I was afraid.
I was considering an abortion, and I called a clinic to make an appointment. I told the lady on the phone that I was spotting every day. She said, “We’ll check it out, then you can consider your options.” I made an appointment, and two close friends drove me from Lakeland, Florida, to Tampa.
We were walking toward the clinic, when a woman [Linda] called out, “A pretty flower for a pretty girl.” Then she looked at all of us and said, “Three pretty flowers for three girls!” That drew me toward her. She gave us the flowers—pink carnations—and then she asked, “What brings you here today?” I lied at first and said I had an appointment to see a doctor. She followed up, asking what was happening. I told her I had found out I was pregnant.
She asked, “Honey, do you know that this is an abortion clinic?” I started to cry, “Yes, I do know.” She asked if she could hold my hand and pray. I said, “Please.” Afterward I said, “You are what I was waiting for. I have been praying every day to God to show me a sign and let me know if I was doing the right thing for myself.”
After that, I saw a lady walk out of the clinic. She looked so dead. The man with her had his hands over her shoulders. He looked relieved, but you could see from the way the woman walked that she had no more purpose. She was gone.
I decided to keep the child, and it was like a big heavy weight lifted off my shoulders. Linda gave me a great big hug. After listing several centers that I should call, she asked if she could call me. She said I could call her if I needed any help—that she would be there for me.
The sun shone the whole day after that. It was beautiful, gorgeous. I sat down on the curb and cried. It was the hardest decision of my life.
After that, every month Linda called me and talked to me on the phone.  I gave her my address and she mailed me a laminated list of baby names and a journal to write in. She also came to the hospital and gave me a painting of Mary holding Jesus.
My son Jowell Anthony was born on Christmas Day. He weighed 6 pounds, 13 ounces.
I live at home with my family now. Jowell is getting big. He wakes up smiling, which makes my day. My father now loves his first grandson and comes to kiss him when he comes home from work. Jowell is a happy baby.
I believe God acted in Linda’s actions. She was like an angel."

						Branches  |  5 Comments",Permanent Link: In Buffalo A Word Casts Out Fear,"By Chris Meehan
The word of the Lord can change your life, even if it comes in question form.
“What would God have you do if you weren’t too afraid to do it?,” asked Jeanne DeCelles (South Bend), speaking at the Buffalo branch women’s retreat in 2002.
The question rattled around in Arlene Meyerhofer’s (Buffalo) mind. She suspected that the Lord was trying to tell her something. “Please, Lord, don’t be subtle!,” she prayed.
She didn’t have to wait long. “When I arrived home from the retreat,” Arlene remembers, “I found my fifth-grade daughter Pamela with a piece of paper in each hand. She had spent the weekend working on lists of reasons to be homeschooled and reasons to stay in school. As the tears welled up, she said, ‘Mommy, see how much bigger the homeschool list is? I just want to learn! Won’t you please pray about homeschooling me?’”
Arlene didn’t know anyone in her area who homeschooled and “the thought of taking responsibility for my child’s future like that terrified me!” But that question from the retreat helped her overcome these fears. She and her husband George talked things over and decided Arlene would begin teaching their daughter.
Plenty of new possibilities flowed from the decision. Pamela did chores one day a week at a riding stable in exchange for horseback riding lessons. She had more time for violin lessons, for Scottish country dancing, art lessons and service projects, too. Arlene also began homeschooling her son George, who enjoyed it so much he passed up a scholarship to a nearby private high school to remain in home school. “I worried that my children would lack social confidence if I homeschooled them, but Pamela recently spoke in front of seven different organizations,” Arlene says. To top things off, this spring Pamela was accepted into the honors program at Ohio’s Xavier University.
“The decision to homeschool was a turning point for our family,” Arlene says. “But without that word I would have been too afraid to undertake the task.”"

By Sean Connolly
Joe Bulger and Mary Timler moved through an Evansville neighborhood dotted with trailers, dirt lots and modest homes. Two women—Bethany and Stephanie—sat on a screened-in porch, talking. The missionaries knew Stephanie already and joined in the conversation.
When the talk turned to cancer, the missionaries told a story from the day before. A woman with osteoarthritis in her neck had been healed of severe pain. “It’s all gone,” the woman had said after they’d finished praying.
As the healing story tumbled out, Bethany looked surprised and then she started talking excitedly.
“I have a friend who has a whole group of Christians living up the street from her,” she said.
Joe and Mary looked at each other. Now they were surprised.
Bethany continued, “They just prayed with her for her shoulder and it was healed.”
Mary made the connection. “Oh, you know LeAnn, too!”
Bethany looked at Joe and Mary. “That was you all?”
Sure enough, a few miles away on the other side of Evansville, the missionaries and LeAnn are neighbors. Bethany and LeAnn are old friends who talk on the phone daily, so LeAnn had naturally told Bethany about the Christians who had invited her over for dinner and prayer meetings, and had prayed with her shoulder for healing.
“Bethany still lives in my old neighborhood,” LeAnn explained to the missionaries later. Then LeAnn agreed to go there with the missionaries sometime and talk with her former neighbors about the Lord.
“When we go through a neighborhood, we don’t always knock on every door,” Mary says. “But the Lord is leading us to the doors he wants us to knock on.
“We aren’t yet concentrating on a single neighborhood for our missionary work. We’re fanning out in different areas and now people in many neighborhoods know us. It’s wonderful to see our efforts bearing fruit across the city.”"

A goateed man named Mark motioned Evansville missionaries Peter Putzier and Mary Grams into his house with one hand, pressing a cell phone against his ear with the other. He hung up the phone and launched into the sad story of his last few months: a fall at work leading to an injured back and knees, losing his factory job, separation from his wife and two sons and heavy drinking.
“I’m afraid I’m going to do a really bad thing,” he kept repeating. “You know what I’m talking about.”
Peter had no doubt. He was talking about ending his life.
Peter assured him, “The Lord has sent us to help.”
The two missionaries prayed with Mark for healing of his knees and back, and they cast out evil spirits of fear and despair.
“You can praise the Lord in both good times and bad,” Peter explained. “You can praise God for your two boys, and for keeping you alive so far.”
Mark knelt down on the floor, littered with empty Diet Coke cans and food wrappers, while Peter led a prayer of rededication to the Lord.
Peter and Mary taught Mark a cheerful tune, “The Lord is my light, the Lord is my salvation, the stronghold of my life, whom shall I fear?”
Mark sang it over and over again. “It was the only time I saw him smile that day,” Peter recalls.
Peter returned to the house the next week, this time with missionary Liz Loughran. (Liz has since returned to college.)
Mark said he had been talking to his professional counselors more often than he had before, and he saw hope in the return of his two sons for a visit.
Peter taught him the rudiments of having a personal prayer time, and he and Liz introduced another song. But Mark only wanted to sing “The Lord Is My Light,” and he insisted that the missionaries write down the words.
“You and the other gal saved my life last week,” he said to Peter. “You came at my lowest point.”"

Trish Brewer (left) and Jenny Sergio plant a vegetable garden in the Triangle area of Indianapolis.
 
The Triangle area of Indianapolis wanted fresh vegetables, so this spring Jenny Sergio and Trish Brewer planted a garden—several varieties of tomatoes and peppers in five neat rows behind the duplex. But one Sunday morning in late May Jenny awoke to discover that that their plants had gone missing.
“There were just holes left in the garden,” Trish remembers.
Walt Seale mentioned the purloined plants to Walter, an older neighbor who mows lawns and knows about neighborhood goings-on. “Neighbors just don’t do that,” Walt told him. “We don’t steal one another’s tomato plants.”
Later that afternoon, Walter came to Walt and mumbled a cryptic message: “Walk down the alley and take a look down there on the left.”
Walt followed the alley behind the duplex, but saw no plants.
A few days later, on Wednesday, as Trish walked from her car to the duplex, another neighbor rode up on his mountain bike. A single full beer can dangled from either side of the handlebars, attached there by two six-pack rings.
“I heard about your tomato plants,” he said. “That’s terrible. I don’t like that at all. I’ve got some plants I want to give you.”
“Really? That’s very generous of you,” Trish said.
The man returned with a plastic pot containing three young tomato plants. “I don’t want this kind of thing happening in this neighborhood,” he told her. “We’re all friends here. We don’t want this to be the kind of place where people do that.”
“It sounded exactly like what Walt had told Walter,” Trish remembers.
She thought the plants looked familiar, but she couldn’t be sure. In any case, the Triangle now has a bigger garden than before the heist, thanks to the three tomato plants and some more vegetable plants donated by an Indianapolis branch member.
“We added a whole extra row to the garden,” Trish says."

Last November, five-year-old Veronica Linczer sat in a small examining room in an Indianapolis children’s hospital, along with her parents Ron and Anne (South Bend) and nine doctors and medical students. Veronica was scheduled for surgery on her cleft palate, until the oral surgeon, the plastic surgeon and the orthodontist got a look at her mouth.
“This is remarkable!,” the doctors kept repeating.
Veronica was born with a cleft palate, though not one that was obvious when her lips were closed. “Inside her mouth, on her upper-right palate, there was a trench-like opening or cleft covered by a clump of skin that should have contained bone and teeth,” Anne explains. “When she smiled you could see the malformed skin in place of one of her teeth.”
When she turned three, Ron and Anne had to decide whether to schedule a major surgery that would graft bone from Veronica’s hip onto her jawbone. If Veronica didn’t have the surgery by the time she turned six, a permanent tooth would not be able to grow in the cleft.
“We delayed surgery to give the Lord time to act,” says Anne. “We invited everyone at our branch meeting to join our family in our daily prayer for healing.”
After praying for more than a year, a baby tooth mysteriously began to poke its way through the folded skin. It took six months to twist and turn into a normal downward position.
The doctors in Indianapolis said they had never seen a tooth emerge from a cleft like that, because there hadn’t been enough bone to support a tooth. An X-ray had revealed new bone growth and another surprise—the shadow of an adult tooth, waiting to replace the baby tooth. A graft was no longer necessary, so the doctors called off the surgery. “It was a true healing,” Anne exclaims. “The gap in her gum line is gone and the cleft is gone. Her palate is in one piece.”"

						Mission Work  |  12 Comments",Permanent Link: On the Indy South Side Seeds of Community Life,"From left: CIM team members David Zimmel and Nick Raway.
 
By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
A new team of 10 people is carrying forward our city-building work on the South Side of Indianapolis: leading prayer meetings, running men’s and women’s groups, visiting neighbors, renovating South Side homes and prepping for a wave of summer Action teams.
Signs of community life are plentiful:
•    10 to 20 neighbors attend the weekly Sunday evening prayer meeting.
•    Two men’s groups and two women’s groups meet weekly.
•    Five South Side neighbors—three men and two women—are underway in the new start.
•    The community and community members have acquired eight houses, including seven located on  two adjacent blocks.
The members of the  team are now part of Christians in Mission (CIM), a recently reestablished unit of the Mission program office that will focus on building community in new start locations. Team members include experienced South Side residents, missionaries transferred from other locations and members with long experience in branch life.
(Note: Christians in Mission is distinct from the Missionary Company, which sent a team to Evansville, Indiana, in February. The Missionary Company aims to make initial contact with neighbors in a new start locale. Both are units of the Mission program office, headed by program coordinator Nick Holovaty.)
Members of the CIM single women's household take in a baseball game. From left: Angie Hass, Cathy Feehly, Naomi Caneff and Melissa Rader.
 
Mission coordinator David Zimmel is in charge of the South Side work. “For three years, we’ve focused on meeting South Siders and talking with them about the Lord. Now our goal is to form the people we’ve met in Christian community life. Our objectives include teaching neighbors to celebrate the Lord’s Day, to participate in a men’s or a women’s group, to study and pray using the Christian Community Bible, and to join in our weekly prayer meetings.
“Since February our team has formed households and found work to support ourselves. We live in three households, one for single men (Charles Chow, Michael Coney, Nick Raway, David Zimmel), one for single women (Naomi Caneff, Cathy Feehly, Angie Hass, Melissa Rader), and one married household (Ray and Robin Gonzalez). Most team members work full-time jobs; a few work part-time so they can free up hours for neighborhood work.
Michael is overseeing renovations to two of the eight houses in the new start, along with a number of improvement projects on the other properties.  Neighbor Larry “Gill” Gilliam has taken charge of renovating a bathroom in one of the homes. “He heard that we needed help so he started stopping by two or three times a week. He recently asked to come underway,” David says.
Four Action teams will also help with the renovation work this summer.
“I’m looking forward to getting a lot of cleaning and renovation accomplished in the next few months,” David adds. “It’s an exciting and busy transition time on the South Side.”"

From left: Andrew Kress (northern Virginia), Eddie Pingel (South Bend) and Sam Mertz (South Bend).
Fourteen Action members are in Indianapolis this week repairing homes on the city’s South Side. Team members are mudding joints, installing windows and doors, adding support beams to a teetering garage and hauling away trash and debris.
This trip includes four Action veterans—Don Ferber (Servant Branch), Chris and Geriann Raway (Servant Branch) and Sam Mertz (South Bend)—who have logged 29 trips to Allendale or Indianapolis among them.
I asked them why they keep going back.
“Working on these trips energizes me,” says Don, a retiree who has traveled 12 times to Allendale and Indianapolis since 2003. “It expands my sense of belonging to the community. I have friends throughout the branches that I’ve met from the trips.”
Chris Raway (Servant Branch) is on his fifth Action trip. “I’m a handyman and I can apply my skills,” he says. “It’s fun teaching them to brothers and sisters.”
Geriann Raway (Servant Branch)
 
“You don’t have to be Mr. Handyman to help on these trips,” he adds. “It’s great if you can plumb, install wiring or do carpentry, but if you can’t there’s still plenty of work to do.”
Work like driving the team from place to place, preparing meals, or traveling to the various Lowe’s and Home Depots around town and begging for discounted building materials.
“The life experiences that adults bring to these trips are huge assets,” adds Mike Coney (Indianapolis), who is managing this Action team’s work. “Just knowing what questions to ask about a job and when to ask them can make the difference between success and failure.”
Jim Brickweg, a junior at Trinity School at River Ridge, says he’s grateful for the chance to improve his carpentry skills. “I spent most of this trip putting in doors, which I didn’t know how to do before. I’ve been working with Chris—it’s been great getting to know him. I can tap into wells of wisdom I don’t already have.”
The Action team has a prayer meeting.
 
A Request for More Action Workers
From Mike Zusi, Action Program Coordinator
Brothers and Sisters,
We need more workers on this summer’s Action trips to Allendale and Indianapolis. We need drivers. We need men and women with experience in construction and experience managing projects and people. We need cooks, shoppers and people willing to beg for discounted and donated materials.
The success of our Action teams depends on the volunteers who come on the trips to lead work crews, teach skills and support the summer staff. Take a look at your summer schedule and pray about serving on an Action trip.  Then go to the Action page of the People of Praise website for information on trips and dates this summer.
Thanks to everyone who has served on Action trips, and thanks also for all your support of Action fundraising.  Your sacrifices are bearing great fruit.
In Christ,
Mike"

By Chris Meehan
“Jesus wants us to walk around this neighborhood and talk to Christians about getting to know one another.”
That’s what Evansville missionary Mary Timler told Denise, a home-schooling mother of three on the last stop of the afternoon on Wednesday, April 7.
“The Lord has been speaking to me about unity for five weeks,” Denise replied. “People need to pray and eat together just like in the book of Acts.”
“About five weeks ago, the Lord began telling us the same thing,” Mary said, astonished.
She realized that she and the other missionaries had been praying and thinking hard about John 17:21 (“that they may all be one . . . so that the world will believe that you have sent me”) at the same time that Denise had been studying Ephesians, with its long sections devoted to unity.
Denise invited Mary into her living room along with her missionary teammates, Joe Bulger and Peter Putzier. Kids’ artwork decorated the walls. Denise said that she’d rededicated her life to God several years earlier and had started attending a Pentecostal church. “The kingdom of God is here, and we need to act like it,” Denise said. “Healings should be normal.” Then she told a story about praying that her own asthma would be healed. The Lord healed her, leaving her doctor perplexed.
At the end of a 45-minute conversation Denise offered to have all the missionaries over for dinner or to let them gather for prayer in her house.
Her offer solved a problem for the missionaries. They’d been talking about having a prayer meeting, but several missionaries were feeling sick, so they needed to find a neighbor willing to host the meeting.
Mary called Denise later that day to see if the missionaries could host their meeting at Denise’s house the next evening. “Oh yeah,” Denise responded. “I meant what I said when I said you all could come over.”
The next evening some of the missionaries, Denise and another neighbor prayed with a woman for baptism in the Spirit in one of Denise’s bedrooms. Denise told Mary later that she hoped they could meet for prayer at her house again.
“Living life together should be normal for Christians,” Denise said."

By Chris Meehan
“I think the Lord wants us to praise the Lord and sing a song to them.”
Catherine Ficker was talking to Peter Putzier as the two missionaries approached a one-story home in an older Evansville subdivision with neat lawns and sidewalks. The missionaries sing often in nursing homes and prayer meetings, but they’d never sung unprompted on a front porch before.
Earlier that afternoon, as the missionaries gathered to pray, someone had read a psalm about praising God. In Catherine’s mind, the word about singing fit right in.
A dark-haired woman of middle age opened the door and looked out at them through the screen. “I think the Lord wants us to sing for you,” Peter said, “and you’re welcome to join in.”
The missionaries raised their hands and sang: “If you want to see the victory of the Lord, why don’t you praise him, lift up your hands and praise him?”
The woman stood plain-faced, but her kindergarten-aged daughter swayed and beamed with delight. She seemed to enjoy every note.
“All right, I have to go,” the woman said, as they finished the song.
“Great,” Peter said. “Praise God!”
The woman closed the door.
“That child got it,” Peter said later. “Her appreciation of our song reminded me of what Jesus said about receiving the kingdom of God like a little child.
“I’m sure God wanted us to sing that day. I would do it again if that’s what needed to be done.”"

Lyrics to “Jesus,” by J-T Kelly:
I picture you in dust and heat
I picture you awake at night
You are exhausted on your feet
Crowds to your left and to your right
And up ahead that looming tree
That only you appear to see
Your closest friends don’t understand
The nature of your Father’s plan
I picture you making a choice
A whole new way of life begun
How many people heard that voice
That called you my beloved Son
When you went off alone to pray
For 40 nights and 40 days
Did anyone go search for you
Or wonder what you’re going through
I picture Peter’s furrowed brow.
I picture Martha’s worried mind
You speak as best as you know how
Using every image you can find
To show your Father bright and clear
To everyone with ears to hear
And when there’s no more words to say
You put yourself up on display
I see that ugly stinking hill
I see the blood run down your face
Your mission now will be fulfilled
in nakedness, pain and disgrace
You finally did what you set out to do
In your death, your Father’s love shines through
And then just look at what your Father does for you
Oh just look at what your Father does for you
I picture New Jerusalem
The city founded on your blood
Your spirit fills up every street
Like a river full in flood
Life without end within her walls
Where you are finally all in all
Your Father forever glorified
In your hands, your feet, your side"

						Mission Work  |  7 Comments",Permanent Link: Missionary Work Expands to Evansville,"By Sean Connolly
Fourteen People of Praise missionaries moved from Indianapolis to Evansville, Indiana, on February 17. The move launched what we expect will be our third new start, following Shreveport (2002) and Indianapolis (2007). Evansville, a city of 120,000 in the southwest corner of Indiana, is the first mission location that is not already home to a People of Praise branch.

Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty heads the Evansville team. In Indianapolis, David Zimmel leads a team of 10 missionaries continuing our work on the South Side.
“Our team is large enough and strong enough to split and work in two locations,” Nick says. “We’ve been training new missionaries in Indianapolis for more than a year. Also, Indianapolis branch members are now very involved in our South Side men’s and women’s groups.”
Since February 17, Evansville missionaries have been knocking on doors around the city, delivering words from the Lord, praying with people and looking for those the Lord is calling to Christian community.

A woman told the missionaries that she could only see white light out of one of her eyes. The missionaries prayed once and then she could see shadows. Remembering that Jesus prayed twice for a blind man (Mk. 8:25), they prayed again. Then she said she could see the missionaries clearly with her bad eye.

A young man accepted the missionaries’ suggestion that they pause in their conversation so he could pray privately for five minutes. During prayer, he heard Jesus tell him that he should give his life over to God. He got down on his knees and did it.
A woman who couldn’t bend her knees because of pain knelt down on the ground in prayer after the missionaries prayed with her. Her pain was still gone a week later.

“Missionary work is physically and mentally taxing, and there are definitely moments of joy,” Nick says. “Some of that joy comes when people dedicate their lives to the Lord, and some of it comes when people laugh at us like they laughed at Jesus at Jairus’s house.” (Mk. 5:40).
The missionaries rely on God to supply some of their basic needs. They eat and live simply. Working odd jobs one day a week is sufficient to cover the rest of their living expenses.

The team lives in two adjacent rented houses half a mile from the University of Evansville. The manager of the houses gave them their first local job. After seeing how well they had cleaned the houses, he offered them work cleaning and renovating his other properties.

“Before moving to Evansville, we made preliminary trips to a number of cities, including Memphis, Louisville and Evansville,” Nick says. “Lots of people in and around Evansville were willing to listen to us and they asked us to come back. We’re glad we did.”

Tuesday in Indianapolis, Action division members cut down a tree, removed a fence and began filling a large dumpster—kicking off the ninth summer of Action division work. Team members began arriving on Monday—15  volunteers from four branches: Corvallis, Shreveport, Servant Branch and northern Virginia.
This summer’s schedule calls for four Action trips to Indianapolis and three to Allendale. The first Allendale trip arrives in Louisiana on June 21.
“There’s a lot of work to be done in both places,” says Action program coordinator Mike Zusi. “In Allendale, we’re going to run a camp for six weeks and do another round of home repair projects for our neighbors. In Indy, we’re cleaning and renovating properties for use in our community building efforts on the South Side and in the Triangle area near IUPUI.”
Walt Seale is directing the Indianapolis work, while Nathan Barrett will direct the work in Allendale.
Members of the first Indianapolis team will dig a trench for a new water line on a South Side home, lay carpet in two homes, untangle a maze of pipes in a Triangle home and clean a house in preparation for occupancy by campus division members next fall.

Mike Zusi says it’s not too late for volunteers to apply to attend one of this summer’s trips. Trip information is available on the Action web site, or volunteers can call Action administrator Jeanette Zimmel, 318-208-1124.
Members of the first Indianapolis team include: John Taylor and Ken Taylor (Corvallis); Andree Louvierre, Mary Jane Parker, Gabriela Bendele and Mark Bendele (Shreveport); Willie Forbes and Bruce Brand (northern Virginia); Elena Radtke, Sean Hagens, Martha Mertz, Lizzie Stauble, Don Ferber, Dick Stauble and Linda Stauble (Servant Branch).

   Evansville missionary Peter Putzier
“I’ve got to sit down—I’m in so much pain,” said Tim, a 25-year-old man with a long white cloth wrapped around his rib cage. He had broken two ribs and torn some of the muscles in his right shoulder in a car accident. It hurt to breathe, and he couldn’t stand up straight without pain.
As Tim sat on his front porch, Evansville missionaries Peter Putzier and Mary Timler started a conversation about the importance of hearing the Lord and responding quickly to what the Lord says.
“I can tell that you both have a relationship with God,” Tim said. “No offense, but I wouldn’t have kept talking to you if I hadn’t seen that.” Five days earlier, at church on Easter Sunday, Tim had rededicated his life to the Lord. He claimed he could “talk your ear off about the Lord.”
He also said that his rib cage hurt at an eight on a scale of one to ten, but when Mary and Peter prayed with him, he said the pain dropped to a two.
“Can you take off the binder?,” Peter asked him.
Tim’s eyes widened as he removed the white cloth, expecting a stab of pain at any moment.
“I can’t believe this.”  Tim began gingerly probing his ribs through his T-shirt, but he couldn’t cause any pain to flare up. He looked at his friend James, standing nearby.
“You’ve seen me the whole time,” Tim said. “I couldn’t take that thing off without grimacing before.”
Tears welled up in his eyes. “Thank you, God! Thank you, God!”
Peter suggested that Tim try singing, which requires deep breathing. Tim easily joined in a chorus of “Our God Is an Awesome God,” then he stood up straight and cried out, “The pain is gone. I’m so glad you came over here today.”
Peter asked Tim if he’d like to join them for missionary work the next day. Tim agreed and spent 90 minutes talking to neighbors and sharing the story of his healing. “At one point we ran into an old friend of his, and Tim was excited to talk about the Lord with him, even offering to pray with him,” Peter says.
When they started the day’s missionary work, Tim’s abdominal binder lay in the same spot on his porch where he had dropped it the day before."

Nick
After getting six or seven doors shut in their faces, South Side missionaries Rus Lyons and Catherine Ficker came to a house Rus knew well: Nick and Bonnie’s place.
Typically, Bonnie would come to the door and offer friendly conversation while Nick stayed quietly in the background. One time a missionary had encouraged Nick to forgive his father and follow Jesus, but Nick had insisted that he wasn’t ready.
Nick answered the door this December day. A former coal miner from West Virginia, he stood on the top step wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. He had jet-black hair, a deep voice and thick glasses. He feared going blind and losing his driver’s license.   He had some news. “I forgave my father,” he told Rus.
Then he started in on his familiar refrain: “I’m not ready to follow the Lord.”
“What would following the Lord look like to you?,” Rus asked.
“Giving up smoking and too much TV, plus attending church,” Nick said.
Rus pointed out that Nick was already following the Lord. It was Jesus who had inspired him to forgive his father.
“Nick, God wants to heal your eyes,” Rus continued, “but on one condition. You can’t say you aren’t ready to follow him—you already are!
“Tomorrow, when you get up, your eyes won’t hurt and have build-up on them. This will be a sign to you that you are ready. And don’t worry about how your whole life will change, just pray and fast and ask the Lord what you should do next.”
As Rus and Catherine prayed over Nick, he looked up and down Alabama Street. “Wow! I can see,” he said. “Really. It’s amazing.” He squinted and read the words on the cover of a Bible.
The next day, when he woke up, the film and pain in his eyes were still gone. He prayed like Rus said, and the Lord told him that he should go out in his yard and rake the leaves. The day after that, his eyes remained painless, but he couldn’t read anymore.
Rus and Catherine came back to visit him several more times, praying for his eyes each time. His pain is still gone and now he can read the large type again.
“He’s excited to see us now,” Rus says. “And he doesn’t say that he’s not ready to follow God.”"

“I hate my stained clothes.”
LaTanya, an eight-year-old Allendale girl, was hopping mad when she got into the car for her ride to school on a recent morning. Her drivers, Allendale missionaries Jeanette Zimmel and Cathy Grill, saw a brownish circle about the size of a quarter on the back of her yellow uniform shirt—a dried stain from oily hair gel.
As they approached the school, Jeanette asked LaTanya if she wanted to pray for anything that morning.
“Can we pray for the stain?,” LaTanya asked.
Jeanette and Cathy prayed three times. The stain didn’t disappear, but they told LaTanya to keep asking God to remove the stain by the time her first class began.
Later that day, one of LaTanya’s friends told her that something seemed different about her appearance. She’d seen the stain earlier, but it wasn’t there any more. LaTanya rushed to the bathroom to check the back of her shirt in the mirror. Her friend was right: no stain.
The next day, LaTanya told Cathy and Jeanette what happened.
“You can be sure God loves you,” Jeanette said. “He took that stain away.”"

Missionaries Peter Putzier and Joe Bulger (Indianapolis) were rapping on the door of a small South Side home, when Robert, a trim, 6’2’’ young man, turned the handle.
“Repent, for the kingdom of God is here!,” Peter said, delivering a message he’d received in prayer that morning.
Robert nearly cut him off. “Oh man, I had a dream about you guys!”
The night before, in his dream, he had seen two men come to his door: two men who looked exactly like Peter and Joe. Robert had been unable to speak in the dream, but he talked eagerly with the missionaries
Robert’s friends, a man and two women, joined the conversation,
asking questions about predictions that a world-altering tragedy is coming in 2012 and whether it’s okay to smoke marijuana since God made it.
“God made bears too, but they’re still dangerous!,” Peter replied with a smile.
After half an hour of talk, Peter addressed Robert directly: “What are you going to do about the dream? What’s your next step?” Robert said that his mother wanted him to go to church again. He said he’d take her the next day.
“Robert was in awe that we were there,” Peter remembers. “He recognized the hand of God.”
A couple of weeks later, Peter and Joe went back to see Robert. He had gone to church the Sunday before. He also said he wanted his newborn son to grow up knowing about the Lord. “It was clear that what we had talked about during our first visit was on his mind. The Lord had definitely paved the way for us!”"

It is with heartfelt regret that we announce the resignation of Paul C. DeCelles, Chair of the Board of Trustees of Trinity Schools, Inc., but we are delighted to announce the election of Craig S. Lent as the new Chair of the Board, effective April 1, 2010.
Paul has been Chair since the founding of the first Trinity School in 1981.  Under his leadership we have grown from a small school of approximately 40 students, holding class in a rented church facility, to a student body of 700 students, 3 campuses and approximately 150,000 square feet of educational space.  During Paul’s tenure, all three Trinity Schools have won the prestigious blue ribbon award from US Department of Education.  Most importantly we’ve produced 1,500 graduates who have excelled academically, in the performing arts, in civic leadership, and in the service of the poor and needy.
Paul’s passion for learning, and specifically for the unique education of Trinity Schools, along with the vision which he brought to fruition over the past 29 years as Chair of the Board of Trustees is unsurpassed.  “I will miss collaborating with all the leaders of the community of learners,” says Paul, “but I am especially grateful for my long association with Clem Walters, Kevin Ranaghan and Kerry Koller, who have been with me on the Board since the beginning.  I’m also grateful that Craig has accepted this position.”
We will miss Paul, but we support him in his decision to focus his efforts on the burgeoning mission, business and communication activities of the People of Praise.  Please join us in thanking him for his many years of service to the mission of Trinity Schools and in praying for his continuing efforts to serve God and his people.
Together with Paul, we welcome Dr. Craig Lent as the new Chair of the Board.  Craig is well suited for this responsibility.  He is the Frank M.

Ann Thomas
By Chris Meehan
Hip pain woke Ann Thomas (South Bend) at 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, May 2, and kept her awake until daylight. Her right hip has troubled her for years—an orthopedic surgeon and X-rays confirm a diagnosis of arthritis, a condition aggravated by bearing nine children and by chemotherapy treatments for cancer.
Just after 3:00 p.m. that day, when Ann stood for the first song at the branch community meeting, her hip was still throbbing. She knew she would have to change positions often to manage the pain.
Lisa Ficker was standing near Ann, at the front of the same section of chairs. A few weeks before, at a gathering of branch women, the Lord had given Lisa a word of knowledge—he wanted to heal someone’s right hip. She’d never given a word in front of such a large group and she didn’t know that Ann had a hip condition.
Lisa didn’t give the word at the women’s meeting, but she thought of it often in the days that followed. She remembered how her own lower back pain had been healed when someone gave a word of knowledge at a branch community meeting.
 “As the May 2 meeting started,” she says, “I felt the Lord remind me of the word.” She walked over to the chairs by the microphone and soon delivered her short message, “I think the Lord wants to heal someone’s right hip today.”
Then Chris Rowland led the branch in a prayer for the healing.
A few seconds later, Ann felt the pain leave her hip. She shared about the healing later in the meeting. The next morning she spent two hours on her hands and knees gardening at a friend’s house, without experiencing the throbbing pain. One month later, the pain is still gone.
In May, Ann attended the graduations of two of her children, the First Communion of a third, and the wedding of her oldest son Ricky. “It was really merciful of the Father to heal my hip,” she says."

By Chris Meehan
Three women sat on portable stools among the gravestones, laughing and crying as they watched the rays of the evening sun stream through the trees. “You might say it was my great sorrow that brought us there, but I’d say it was really the love of my sisters in Christ,” explains Judy Hickey (Saskatoon).
Judy’s mother died 44 years ago, when Judy was eight years old. Following the custom of the time, Judy and her sister had not been allowed to attend their mother’s funeral services. The pain and anguish from losing her mom grew over the years, but Judy didn’t talk about it very much. Then she brought up her grief at a women’s group meeting.
“Judy, have you ever been to your mother’s grave?,” Janice Akerman asked after hearing the story.
“No. I’m afraid it’ll be too hard. And I don’t even know where she’s buried.”
“We’ll find out. We’ll come and get you next Monday for women’s group and we’ll go with you, if that’s what you need,” Janice said.
The next Monday evening, Suzanne Rooke and Janice rolled up to Judy’s house in Janice’s car. They drove 20 minutes to a large cemetery. Janice found the grave’s location online and printed a map so Judy could find the spot then and in the future.
Janice and Suzanne brought flowers for Judy to place on her mother’s grave. As they sat in the warm sun, Judy shared memories of her mother, the things she missed the most, and how her mother’s death had affected her life over the years.
“As we talked and cried together,” says Judy, “I realized how grateful I was for these women, and for the time and effort we had put into our friendship over the years to bring us to this point. They were God’s provision for me. I found that I could start to face my grief and move along with it, once I had the strength and courage of my women’s group to bolster me. I wouldn’t have wanted to face it on my own.”"

 By Chris Meehan
Tom Evans, the coordinator responsible for the Biloxi, Mobile and Shreveport branches will step down from his position on July 1, 2010. Diane, Tom’s wife, will also relinquish her handmaid-type responsibilities for these three branches.
Mike Coney, principal branch coordinator for New Orleans and a member of the community’s board of governors, will assume Tom’s responsibilities. Linda Coney, principal handmaid in New Orleans, will take up Diane’s work relating to the women leaders of these three branches.
Tom began serving as a mission coordinator in 1987. In 1988, he helped guide the St. Mary of the Pines prayer group in Shreveport through their decision to become a People of Praise mission branch. He and Diane have seen the Shreveport branch through the sudden deaths of two branch leaders, Jim Minto and Pat O’Connor and through the changes that came with the birth of the community’s Allendale outreach in 2002. They helped the Biloxi and Mobile branches recover after Hurricane Katrina scattered members and destroyed homes in 2005. From 1987 to 1999 Tom served as principal branch coordinator for New Orleans.
“Tom has been a fine pastoral leader, good at moving people forward, and he performed brilliantly in a number of difficult situations with his calm and steady presence” says Kevin Ranaghan, head of the branch relations team on which Tom and Diane serve. “And Diane excels in one-on-one pastoral work.”
Cliff Vaughan, Shreveport’s head branch leader, agrees: “I’m so grateful to Tom. He’s continually formed us through weekly phone calls and personal visits, two, three or four times a year—whatever was necessary. Tom always has the right words to say. He knows the Lord and he knows the People of Praise and that’s a great combination. Tom and Diane have been so generous with their time, their wisdom and their sense of humor. Just ask Diane about the rubber cockroaches that sometimes appear in funny places after their visits.”
The Shreveport branch honored Tom and Diane at a Lord’s Day meal during their branch visit in April. Debbie Vaughan said, “When I spend time with Diane, I experience being formed in the community’s ways. For example, Diane doesn’t just know the community’s teaching on right speech. She has the heart of the Lord, his love, for the people she talks about, so of course she speaks rightly about them. I also admire Tom’s integrity.  What he believes is what he says, what he says is what he lives. There’s a wholeness about him.”
At 72, Tom says he’ll manage to stay busy, compliments of Diane’s To-Do-When-Retired List. They also hope to visit branches they’ve never been to. Tom and Diane have two grown sons.
Craig Lent had this to say about the Coneys: “Mike’s extensive pastoral experience and Linda’s years as principal handmaid for her branch make them well-qualified for this work. Mike recently retired from Shell Oil. They’re a wonderful couple with a great family—they’ll do a super job.”"

Pat Hrbacek was appointed to head the Colorado Springs branch on September 10. He follows Louis Grams, who has served as the branch’s head since 2000.
“The vision, pastoral care and guidance Louis possesses have done so very much to build this newer branch,” said Kevin Ranaghan, chair of the branch relations council. “There is no way to express adequately everyone’s gratitude to him.
“Louis has faced health problems in recent years, including a number of surgeries and recoveries. Pat has been serving as the branch’s acting head for a number of months, a job he has done very well. Please pray for Pat as he continues these responsibilities.”
Pat and his wife Kara moved to Colorado Springs from Servant branch in 2000, arriving a few months after the Gramses, who also came from Servant Branch. (Kara is the daughter of Jim and Carol Rolland of Servant Branch). The Hrbaceks have four daughters. In addition to leading the branch, Pat works as an attorney and is a partner in a Colorado Springs law firm. Kara is a stay-at-home mother and part-time high school humanities teacher.
“Kara and I have been the recipients of so much love and service from our brothers and sisters in Colorado Springs,” Pat says. “So it’s an honor and a privilege for me to serve in this new way, especially following Louis, who has been a model servant in this position.”
In 2006, Louis was bending over to work in his garden when some screws in his back (from a previous surgery) came loose, triggering major damage to his autonomic nervous system. He says that doctors understand little about how to repair the autonomic nervous system, but a number of specialists can treat his various symptoms—blood pressure swings, breathing trouble and fatigue among them. He relies on a portable oxygen machine to assist with his breathing.
Louis is quick to add that his doctors have uncovered no connection between his current health problems and the Churg-Strauss syndrome that the Lord healed him of in 1997. He continues to work for Kevin and the branch relations office and he’s a member of the Colorado Springs branch leaders team. He is writing music, and beginning to compile the many musical compositions he has penned over the years.
“When I was sick before [in the mid-1990s] I was so preoccupied with being sick that it was all I could think about. This is a different experience. I feel well some of the time, and when I feel sick I find lots of grace to do what I can do,” Louis says. “The Lord has more for me to do and I’m looking forward to what’s next.”"

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly
A violent crisis disrupted life in Kingston, Jamaica, last week as local gangs and government forces clashed. The fighting began after police launched a manhunt for Christopher Coke, a gang leader wanted on gun and drug trafficking charges in the United States. Seventy civilians are reported dead amid rumors of aggressive police tactics and a trail of corruption that allegedly leads to the country’s Prime Minister Bruce Golding, according to multiple news reports. The government declared a state of emergency and has restricted some civil liberties.
The day the conflict boiled over, Sunday, May 23, members of the Kingston branch came unwittingly close to the fighting. Branch members delivering meals to residents near the Tivoli Gardens neighborhood encountered barricades and saw black smoke rising from a burning police station.
“We knew there was a risk of trouble when we set out to deliver food, but we saw other cars driving into the area, so we decided to go ahead,” explains Joseph Mutidjo, a member of the feeding team. “Demand for food was heavier than usual because other feeding groups stayed away.
“Later that day a gun battle took place on the same street we had been on. The Lord definitely protected our feeding team.”
The team handed out 320 meals that Sunday.
As the violence spread, schools closed and many businesses shut their doors. The branch canceled men’s and women’s group meetings and members did their best to stay home. Locksley Robinson nearly drove into a gunfight on his way home from work, but police stopped him and sent him another way.
All branch members are safe and unharmed.
The fighting has subsided this week, though the state of emergency remains in force and Christopher Coke is still on the run.
“It’s a tragic situation,” says head branch leader Vince Keaveny, “the worst I’ve ever seen.”
“We tried to keep a low profile last week,” adds Joseph. “Rumors were flying everywhere, and the situation was fluid and confusing. Please pray for us, and pray that we can figure out how to continue delivering food to the people who need it.”
Editor’s Note: Kingston branch member Sam Davis submitted this first person account of the effort to feed Kingston’s homeless on Sunday, May 23.
Feeding His Lambs in the Lion’s Den
By Sam Davis
Despite the rising tension and concerns for the safety of our teams, we decided that our feeding ministry must go on.  We did not realize that God had already set in motion a plan that would not only grant safe passage for his servants but would deliver more meals than we had ever delivered to the homeless and poor.
The first sign that this was going to be an extraordinary day came when we met to prepare our food.  When the pots we’d used to cook the food were empty, we had packaged a record 320 meals! (We normally distribute 250 meals.)
We held hands in a circle and prayed that God would provide a special cloak of security for us and that he would lead us to the 320 brothers and sisters most in need. We worried that many of the homeless would not be in their usual spots and that there would be meals left over. Nevertheless, we set out on Kingston’s emptier-than-usual streets in search of the hungry.
In downtown Kingston we were happy to see familiar faces emerge to greet our vehicle.  The homeless formed a line, said grace and collected their meals against the backdrop of black smoke from a building set on fire less than two miles away.
“We haven’t seen the others [from other feeding programs],” one lamented as he requested a second meal to have later in the evening.  Suddenly, the purpose of the additional meals became clear.  With the civil unrest, there was no guarantee of when and where the next meal would come from. Many received a second meal until they all were gone!
Soon after we left, the government declared a state of public emergency and sealed off the downtown area.  From television we learned that there were gunfights that day on the very streets on which we stood handing out meals.
That day reminded us that if we are willing and obedient our God is faithful and we need not fear any ill.  We now eagerly look forward to our next feeding program!"

Editor’s Note: In an interview conducted by Chris Meehan, Rosa, a 21-year-old college student from Lakeland, Florida, describes meeting Linda Scrofani (Tampa) last May, when Linda and fellow branch member Pat Benito were working as sidewalk counselors at a Tampa abortion facility. We’re not using Rosa’s real name.
On May 12, 2009, I found out I was pregnant. I was living alone and going to college. My father is a strict man. I was afraid.
I was considering an abortion, and I called a clinic to make an appointment. I told the lady on the phone that I was spotting every day. She said, “We’ll check it out, then you can consider your options.” I made an appointment, and two close friends drove me from Lakeland, Florida, to Tampa.
We were walking toward the clinic, when a woman [Linda] called out, “A pretty flower for a pretty girl.” Then she looked at all of us and said, “Three pretty flowers for three girls!” That drew me toward her. She gave us the flowers—pink carnations—and then she asked, “What brings you here today?” I lied at first and said I had an appointment to see a doctor. She followed up, asking what was happening. I told her I had found out I was pregnant.
She asked, “Honey, do you know that this is an abortion clinic?” I started to cry, “Yes, I do know.” She asked if she could hold my hand and pray. I said, “Please.” Afterward I said, “You are what I was waiting for. I have been praying every day to God to show me a sign and let me know if I was doing the right thing for myself.”
After that, I saw a lady walk out of the clinic. She looked so dead. The man with her had his hands over her shoulders. He looked relieved, but you could see from the way the woman walked that she had no more purpose. She was gone.
I decided to keep the child, and it was like a big heavy weight lifted off my shoulders. Linda gave me a great big hug. After listing several centers that I should call, she asked if she could call me. She said I could call her if I needed any help—that she would be there for me.
The sun shone the whole day after that. It was beautiful, gorgeous. I sat down on the curb and cried. It was the hardest decision of my life.
After that, every month Linda called me and talked to me on the phone.  I gave her my address and she mailed me a laminated list of baby names and a journal to write in. She also came to the hospital and gave me a painting of Mary holding Jesus.
My son Jowell Anthony was born on Christmas Day. He weighed 6 pounds, 13 ounces.
I live at home with my family now. Jowell is getting big. He wakes up smiling, which makes my day. My father now loves his first grandson and comes to kiss him when he comes home from work. Jowell is a happy baby.
I believe God acted in Linda’s actions. She was like an angel."

						Branches  |  5 Comments",Permanent Link: In Buffalo A Word Casts Out Fear,"By Chris Meehan
The word of the Lord can change your life, even if it comes in question form.
“What would God have you do if you weren’t too afraid to do it?,” asked Jeanne DeCelles (South Bend), speaking at the Buffalo branch women’s retreat in 2002.
The question rattled around in Arlene Meyerhofer’s (Buffalo) mind. She suspected that the Lord was trying to tell her something. “Please, Lord, don’t be subtle!,” she prayed.
She didn’t have to wait long. “When I arrived home from the retreat,” Arlene remembers, “I found my fifth-grade daughter Pamela with a piece of paper in each hand. She had spent the weekend working on lists of reasons to be homeschooled and reasons to stay in school. As the tears welled up, she said, ‘Mommy, see how much bigger the homeschool list is? I just want to learn! Won’t you please pray about homeschooling me?’”
Arlene didn’t know anyone in her area who homeschooled and “the thought of taking responsibility for my child’s future like that terrified me!” But that question from the retreat helped her overcome these fears. She and her husband George talked things over and decided Arlene would begin teaching their daughter.
Plenty of new possibilities flowed from the decision. Pamela did chores one day a week at a riding stable in exchange for horseback riding lessons. She had more time for violin lessons, for Scottish country dancing, art lessons and service projects, too. Arlene also began homeschooling her son George, who enjoyed it so much he passed up a scholarship to a nearby private high school to remain in home school. “I worried that my children would lack social confidence if I homeschooled them, but Pamela recently spoke in front of seven different organizations,” Arlene says. To top things off, this spring Pamela was accepted into the honors program at Ohio’s Xavier University.
“The decision to homeschool was a turning point for our family,” Arlene says. “But without that word I would have been too afraid to undertake the task.”"

						Branches  |  6 Comments",Permanent Link: Community Members Return to Employment,"By Chris Meehan
In the current weak US job market, some community members have emerged from long stretches of unemployment with strengthened faith and paychecks in hand. On smaller salaries and budgets that remain tight, they tell of increased trust in God and deep appreciation for the support of the community.
Their stories vary, revealing no magic formula for finding employment.
Hugh Springer, Sr. (Servant Branch) found a job with a much a longer commute—295 miles, all the way to Neenah, Wisconsin. (He stays with Steve and Amee Pable of the Appleton Branch during the week and returns to the Twin Cities on weekends.) On the other hand, the job John Fasbender (Servant Branch) found is in nearby downtown Minneapolis.
Hugh’s job as manager for a medical products company came after two years of searching and more than 100 interviews. John benefitted from the concern of a brother, Brad Bye, who heard from a golf buddy about a management job at a title insurance company.  “Brad’s recommendation got me the crucial first interview, which ultimately led to the job,” John says.
The recession hit Muncie hard, leaving 10 of the 34 men in the branch unemployed. Three years ago, Dan Capstick lost his job of 22 years at auto parts manufacturer BorgWarner. He worked briefly for another company before landing a job with good benefits but a lower salary at Tomasco, a parts supplier for Honda. Like John, Dan got the job through a community brother who passed his resume along to a supervisor. “I knew something good would eventually happen,” Dan says.
Servant Branch members Mary Jo Koplos and Paul Putzier took advantage of their unemployment to explore new possibilities. Mary Jo lost her full-time job composing software manuals for the University of Minnesota three years ago. She relied on money saved for just such an emergency, and eventually decided to accept several part-time jobs, rather than full-time work. “God had to help me see that I need not take the standard 9-to-5 route,” she says. “I had to make some cutbacks and take some initiative, but the Lord took care of me.”
She is currently writing product descriptions, substitute teaching, editing a newsletter and writing features for a news web site based in Eagan, Minnesota. The last job allows her to write stories about the community and Trinity School, both based in Eagan.
Paul Putzier, a geologist by training, researched a variety of new occupations before launching his own business. He is now a job placement specialist, helping people find new lines of work after suffering injuries. Jim Reinhardt, a professional in this field, helped Paul get the business going. “I encounter the Lord every day in my work and routinely pray with clients,” Paul says. “It’s tremendously gratifying to help others find work, even when it’s as basic as assisting them in creating a resume.”
After a slow start-up year, Paul says the work is paying well, though less than his previous job. Like some of the others, he says he relied on the generosity of brothers and sisters to help his family make ends meet.
Of course, there are still community members who remain unemployed. Jon Cassady (northern Virginia) lost his marketing job with IBM in March, 2009. He plugs ahead with vigor—networking and interviewing—with an encouraging word always at the ready. In the meantime, he has lent some of his expertise to the LaSalle Company and its web site development division, One:Ten Communications.  As far as Jon is concerned, unemployment, just like employment, is an opportunity to serve. “I have a new mindset now: whether I have a job or not, God is my employer.”"

						Branches  |  19 Comments",Permanent Link: Mercy for a Thief,"By Chris Meehan
After the Lord saved Beth Boyle (Servant Branch) from the theft of her Christmas cash, she saw a chance to pass along God’s generosity to the thief.
Confronting a thief was the last thing on her mind as she strolled into the entryway of the Cub Foods grocery store the Saturday afternoon before Christmas. All she wanted to do was polish off her Christmas shopping by picking up some made-in-Minnesota specialty items for her South Dakota relatives. She was carrying some extra cash in her purse to make the purchases.
Beth Boyle
The store was jammed, and so were the carts in the covered entryway. Beth stopped to help a woman untangle her cart. Then, as she stepped inside the store with her own cart, she noticed a display of Minnesota-grown Honeycrisp apples to her immediate left. She turned to get a better look.
“Suddenly, I had a strong nudge to turn around and check my cart,” she says. “Definitely from the Holy Spirit. A man, standing alongside my cart, quickly turned away.”
Suspicious, Beth turned to check her purse. Her wallet was gone.
She looked up at the man and caught his eye. “Excuse me, sir, have you seen my wallet?”
“No, ma’am,” he replied. “Are you sure you didn’t leave it in the car?”
“Yes . . . I checked it as I was getting out of the car.”
The man began walking toward the store exit, but Beth followed.
She caught up with him, then summoned up a boldness she didn’t know she had. “I’m sorry, but can I check your coat?”
The man didn’t reply and he didn’t run, so Beth patted down the front pockets of his heavy wool overcoat. Unable to find anything, but still not at ease, she moved into position between the man and the exit and asked if she could summon the manager for a more thorough search.
“My mother’s waiting for me,” the man said. “I can’t wait for him.” Then he brushed past Beth and ran out the door. Disappointed, Beth watched him run.
Suddenly, a voice called out from behind Beth, “Run after him!” It was the woman she had helped with the cart.
Encouraged, Beth darted after the man, who was sprinting across the parking lot toward the street. “Police! Help! Theft!” she yelled as she ran.
Abruptly the man turned around. “I’m going to get rid of this,” he said, as he ran past her. He tossed her wallet through the store’s front doors, then ran off again.
Beth saw that her money was still inside, so she went over to the woman who had helped her out. She hugged and thanked the woman and her mother, calling them “the angels in my path.” “We’re praying for you,” the woman said.
After the conversation, she saw that the man was in custody.
A policeman came and began asking Beth if she wanted to press charges. He said that the thief had freely admitted to taking her wallet. Beth thought about it for a moment.
“What was going through my mind was that God was merciful to protect me and give me back my wallet. So perhaps I could turn around and be merciful—it was a bit of the Christmas spirit.”
She told the policeman that she would not press charges, but agreed with his suggestion that the man be banned from entering that store in the future.
“I left the situation with a grateful heart, and a strong desire to pray that it be a life-changing experience for him,” she said. “I felt God’s presence every step of the way.”"

						Trinity School  |  4 Comments",Permanent Link: Greenlawn Sophomores Study Food Chemistry,"By Sean Connolly
Thirty-one Trinity School at Greenlawn sophomores spent Project Week working in the chemistry labs at Saint Mary’s College. They were living out an idea hatched by former Greenlawn chemistry teacher Katy McShane (South Bend) a year ago.
The students learned lab techniques and designed experiments to reveal the chemistry of everyday objects—pennies, aspirin, fast food hamburgers, even Mountain Dew.
The key catalyst for their learning was Dr. Toni Barstis, a Saint Mary’s chemistry professor, Trinity parent and cancer survivor.
Toni and Katy began talking about the idea after last year’s Project Week. They formed a bond through their common enthusiasm for science and their common connection to cancer. After Mrs. McShane died from pancreatic cancer in October, her co-chemistry teacher (and the new head of school) John Lee added his enthusiasm, and the plan for this year’s Project Week was born. St. Mary’s offered the labs and Dr. Barstis volunteered her time to guide the students.
Christen and Marian (Photos courtesy of Saint Mary's College.)
They began with the basics, designing experiments to study how the mass of a penny changes after years in circulation. They moved on to synthesizing aspirin and learning a lab technique called thin-layer chromatography, which they employed to determine the chemical make up of over-the-counter pain tablets. (This technique could come in handy in a poisoning situation, Dr. Barstis explains—if someone swallowed a host of unmarked tablets and their composition had to be determined in a hurry).
The students spent the final three days executing their own experiments around common foods and beverages. Many measured the sugar content in soft drinks. Others explored the fat content in burgers, the salt content in soups and the calorie content in nuts. All the students prepared formal lab reports to communicate their findings.
“I wanted to make sure that the experiments weren’t scripted, that the students could create and put their own stamp on their work,” Dr. Barstis says.
The results?
Grace Pingel and Christa Rose tested burgers from McDonalds, Burger King and Wendy’s.  They ground the meat, liquified it, and spun tubes of liquified meat in the centrifuge to isolate the fat from the protein, before carefully weighing the fat. The Burger King patty measured in at 28.6% fat, while Wendy’s scored the healthiest burger, with 14.4% fat.
Michael Sayre and Bobby Cramer tested the sugar content in sodas and other drinks. They prepared sugar-water solutions to use as controls and used a homemade hydrometer (basically a small buoy) to measure the density of their solutions. Then they compared the densities of the sodas with the controls to determine sugar content. The two were surprised that Mountain Dew and Arizona lemon tea had similar sugar concentrations—about 17% (the highest concentrations they measured).
Nate Griggs and Tim Pingel tackled the salt content in soups. Their experiment involved reacting silver-nitrate with their soup and some chromate ions. The reaction was supposed to yield a red precipitate. But they ran into trouble when testing tomato soup–there was no way to see the precipitate in the red soup.
From left, Guanhua, Noah, Natalee and Alex in the Saint Mary's chemistry lab.
This is exactly the sort of real world problem Mr. Lee was hoping students would stumble upon. “When the groups come to a roadblock,” he says, “they have to collaborate and ask themselves, what chemistry do we know that will help us go beyond this?”
In the case of the tomato soup, Tim and Nate redesigned their experiment to get around the obstacle. “We used a filtering process that we had learned the day before synthesizing aspirin,” Tim said.
“It was a lot of fun being in a college lab,” added sophomore Marian DeLee. “It made us feel more like scientists. I also liked the independence we had. Our teachers didn’t give us a lot of instructions, just the basics. We had to figure out how we wanted to make our measurements.”
The concentration on the students’ faces and the excited chatter in the lab made the students’ reactions to the week of experiments seem obvious.
“My goal was to encourage the students, to get them excited about science, to take Katy’s energy and build on that,” Dr. Barstis said.
It’s an experiment that Mr. Lee hopes can be repeated next year."

The press sold 900,000 books in 2010, including Catholic high school religion textbooks, books on spirituality, resources for parish ministry and, increasingly, e-books and other digital content. Ave Maria is a 144-year-old Catholic publishing house founded by the Congregation of Holy Cross and  located in Notre Dame, Indiana.
“Ave Maria came to us at a time when both publishing and education are standing at a crossroads because of the Internet,” says David Salmon (South Bend), One:Ten’s president. “This new web site puts them in a strong position to serve their current market and to benefit from future Internet-driven changes. We’re very grateful that they entrusted us with the creation of this important component of their business, and we look forward to expanding our partnership.”
One:Ten, based in South Bend, is the division of the LaSalle Company that builds web sites for businesses and specializes in serving the needs of publishers. The company has grown to 10 employees since its founding in 2006.
“One:Ten did more for us than we thought was possible,” Mr. Grady says. “I can’t imagine a more hardworking, creative, diligent and above all patient group of people.”
The new Ave Maria home page includes a carousel of moving book images, a banner with rotating ads, and news on company products, but the biggest innovation lies behind the scenes. One:Ten’s lead developer Jeremy Osterhouse designed features that give Ave Maria control over every aspect of their home page. Ave Maria employees can edit text and swap product information in and out of the page, and they have the power to alter the layout. The banner, carousel and other design elements can all be rearranged with a few mouse clicks.
“We wanted to be able to redesign the home page every day if we wanted to,” Mr. Grady says. “We wanted the look and feel of a daily newspaper.”
Click on a book image, and the site takes you to its product page. Alongside information about author, title and price are links to YouTube videos and interviews with authors, sneak peeks inside the book, related links and easy ways to spread the word about the book on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
Ave Maria provides students and teachers with free online supplements for many of its textbooks: classroom handouts, crossword puzzles, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, even sample tests. “These resources are important to teachers and to our business,” says Mr. Grady. “We wanted them to be available in an attractive and clear way. One:Ten did that for us.”
Another key feature: when customers order books, the site can help determine what type of customers they are (parish, individual buyer, bookstore, etc.) and offer volume discounts and other special prices accordingly. This streamlines the ordering process, says Mr. Grady.
He adds that one of the major reasons he hired One:Ten was their roots in the religious education market as part of the LaSalle Company and their background as a Christian company. “It was terrific to work with a group of people who already understand our mission. We didn’t have to instruct them in what a Catholic high school is all about, what a parish is all about, what our books are all about. Many times, after they left our meetings, we would shake our heads in relief and talk about how glad we were to be working with them.”
One:Ten computer programmer Collin Anderson (South Bend) says the feeling was mutual: “One highlight for me was building a web site for another Christian business, knowing that we were moving the kingdom of God forward together.”
Project manager Laura Ficker (South Bend) adds that she appreciated the hard work, patience and thoroughness of the Ave Maria staff. “They were a perfect fit for working with us,” she says."

						Mission Work  |  12 Comments",Permanent Link: Chasing After God,"By Chris Meehan
About 6:00 on a Saturday evening in late January, missionaries Rus Lyons, Peter Putzier and Joe Bulger were standing at a gas station in tiny Hartford, Kentucky—64 miles from Evansville. They’d walked 36 miles over three days of hitchhiking and sharing the gospel with people in small towns. The trip had been one of their toughest—at least in terms of catching rides.
Previous trips had always brought them home in time to open the Lord’s Day with their fellow missionaries, to tell stories and rejoice together in what the Lord had done. But it was already too late for that. Darkness had set in, limiting their options. They’d learned by experience that it’s practically impossible to hitchhike after dark.
They had been exchanging text messages with Nick Holovaty in Evansville about their predicament. “Call Evan Reinhardt,” he wrote. As the missionaries sat down to open the Lord’s Day, Nick led them in a prayer for their brothers, asking God to bring them home by 7:45.
With hope and a prayer, Rus dialed Evan. Evan is a 29-year-old Christian who lives in Owensboro, Kentucky, a town about halfway between Evansville and Hartford. On a previous hitchhiking trip, he had stopped his truck to pick up Nick and two other missionaries, telling them that he felt his truck was a gift from God and that he wanted to do something good with it.
To their surprise, Evan was already in Hartford, visiting a friend about a quarter mile from where the missionaries were. He eagerly agreed to wrap up his visit and drive them as far as his gas supply would allow.
When Nick found out that Evan was driving the missionaries, he called and invited Evan to come to Evansville and spend the night with the missionaries. Evan happily jettisoned his evening plans and drove the missionaries all the way back. “You gotta chase after God,” he said.
They arrived in Evansville just after 7:45, after most of the missionaries had eaten. Everybody was eager to meet Evan and hear stories from the trip. (The previous evening, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, the hitchhikers had prayed with three college students for baptism in the Holy Spirit.) As he ate, Evan kept pausing to comment on the food: “This is amazing! Five-star restaurant quality!”
The next morning, Nick and Rus showed Evan how to make a Scriptural meditation, and Evan made one before he needed to leave to make it to his church service. Before he left, he commented on the fellowship he’d experienced in that short time, telling Nick, “This is what everybody wants, but not many people have it.”
He hopped into his truck, waved and took off—but stopped after 20 feet, stuck his head out the window and thanked the missionaries one more time.
“We’ve met lots of people like Evan in our missionary work,” Nick says, “Christians who are hungry for fellowship and willing to chase after God, even if that means driving 60 miles to be with us for the Lord’s Day. The Lord is connecting the Christians in the Mississippi Valley. He is building a network of believers.”"

By Chris Meehan
The Kingston branch held a large Festival of Lessons and Carols on Sunday, December 19. Ushers estimated that 300 people attended the ecumenical service, put on by the 30-member branch.
“In previous years we held the service in the high school performing arts hall where we normally meet, which can hold 100 people,” says Kevin Rodriguez, one of the organizers of this year’s event. “But it’s been on our hearts to share the experience with more people.”
There was no shortage of space in Kingston’s 100-year-old Holy Trinity Cathedral, site of this year’s service, which the branch put on in collaboration with members of the cathedral parish. Kingston’s Roman Catholic Archbishop Donald James Reese offered a welcome to the crowd.

Branch member Sam Davis gave one of several reflections during the traditional pre-Christmas service, which includes a series of reflections and Scripture readings interspersed with Christmas hymns. “The new people I encountered were very, very happy to be there,” he said.
Three guest instrumentalists from a nearby home for boys added saxophone, flute and clarinet to the usual bass, drums and guitar in the branch’s music ministry, and another guest played the keyboard.
Branch members pitched in to promote and prepare for the event. “I handed out flyers at my church. I also brought along family members and they loved it,” said Dorothy Over.
“The event put us in the mood for Christmas by reminding us what it’s really all about,” added Dawn Keaveny..
Holy Trinity’s pastor has already invited the branch to host the event again in 2011."

						Mission Work  |  13 Comments",Permanent Link: In Allendale Holiday Hams Arrive on Time,"By Chris Meehan
The Tuesday before Christmas, Patti Deakin looked out her window in Allendale and discovered a man dropping off some heavy boxes on the front porch of the house next door. Patti went over and found seven packages, each containing ham, vegetables, fruit, potatoes and cookies, enough food to serve as Christmas dinner for a family of six.
The food came from the youth group at the Catholic parish some of the community members in Allendale attend. The same church had given the Allendale Christians in Mission team some Turkey dinners at Thanksgiving, but Patti says, “we had no idea there would be food to distribute this Christmas.” Patti, her husband Gerry and Nathan Barrett talked about whom they might give them to, and they quickly came up with six names. “Since Christmas comes at the end of the month, many Allendale residents were low on food stamps, and these gifts were much appreciated,” Patti says.
They needed a seventh name, and Gerry thought of Karl, a disabled vet who frequently rides his bicycle down Yale Avenue. Though Gerry saw Karl frequently, his personality had remained something of a mystery. It had taken Gerry more than a year even to learn his name. Then, bit by bit, Gerry had pieced together some of his story. He was a former drug addict who earned money by doing yardwork. He was also trying to help his wife get through a 90-day program to overcome her own drug addiction. But Gerry didn’t know where Karl lived, or if he had a stove to cook the food or a refrigerator to store it in.
The next day Karl knocked on Gerry’s door and Gerry asked him if he had a working stove and refrigerator. He did, so Gerry offered him the food. Karl’s eyes grew big and he gave a wide grin.
“Nobody ever does that for me, Mr. Gerry,” he said.
“But the Lord is going to do it for you today!” Gerry replied."

“So what do you have to do to join this thing? How do you get in?,” asked Devon Wallace. He had just spent the afternoon knocking on doors alongside Evansville missionary Rus Lyons.
“Well, we’re part of an ecumenical, charismatic, covenant Christian community,” Rus began.
“I don’t know what any of those words mean,” Devon said, “but I’m in!”
Earlier that day, Rus was getting ready to hop into the missionaries’ minivan and head to Rockport, Indiana, a nearby town where a few other missionaries were already knocking on doors. Then he remembered Devon, a 31-year-old Christian who had been coming to the men’s group meetings the missionaries host. Rus called him and asked if he’d like to tag along for the day’s mission work. “I’m leaving in five minutes,” Rus said.
Devon agreed, and a few minutes into the 35-minute drive burst into spontaneous prayer. “Thank you, Lord, for sending this man of God to pick me up so we can go do your will. This is awesome!”
“Someday Devon may come underway,” Rus remarked later. “But for now, I’d have to say I agree with him. He’s one of us. He really loves God and he loves us and what we’re doing. We’re including him in our plans for the future in Evansville.”

						Branches  |  2 Comments",Permanent Link: South Bend Campers Heading North to Servant Camp,"By Chris Meehan
Campers and counselors from the South Bend branch will head north to Canon Falls, Minnesota, in August to join Servant Branch brothers and sisters for a week at Servant Camp. John Zwerneman made the announcement at a meeting of the South Bend branch on January 8, following a series of discussions in the branch about the future of its summer camp.
“This year, we’re going to be joining forces with another very successful camp that began the same year our camp did, in 1978,” John said.
Servant Camp director Pat Ficker is enthusiastic about a unified camp. “I am extremely happy at the prospect of combining camps,” he says, “and my fellow camp directors are delighted as well. I think it’s the Lord at work–making us all one.”
John explained that the South Bend branch will not hold their camp locally in the next few years due to rising costs, scheduling conflicts and a forecasted decline in the number of branch youth. “We decided to take action now, before a decline in numbers became a big problem,” he said. Servant Camp has also seen a decline in the number of campers in recent years, making the move advantageous for both branches, Pat says.
John and Mary Behrens (South Bend), directors of the South Bend branch’s camp, will join Pat’s administrative staff and take special concern for the campers from South Bend. Pat says he hopes to place a counselor or two from South Bend with each group of campers.
“We’re looking forward to the relationships that will blossom for our children when they experience the joys of summer camp with the children from Servant Branch,” John Behrens says.
South Bend parent Ann Marie Pingel admits to feeling a touch of sadness that South Bend branch members won’t be returning to Michigan’s Camp Tanadoonah in 2012, but she also sees a sunny side: “I’m excited about the opportunities our children will have to build relationships between branches–something that usually has to wait until they join Action.”
South Bend camper Leo Kane (10), is excited that the new camp will give him the opportunity to fire a gun at their rifle range. His friend Xavier Olsen, 11, agreed, but added that using the camp’s climbing wall is a primary goal for him.
Calla Couch (20) is a veteran of both camps and has been encouraging her South Bend friends to join her at Servant Camp for years. “I really like it that the camp property is so large, offering plenty of beautiful hiking space.” This year’s camp will be a family affair for Calla: not only are her two sisters, Katherine (17) and Colleen (15) serving as counselors, and her youngest siblings Daniel (13), Aidan (10) and Bonnie (7) going as campers, but her mother, Beth, has also volunteered to be a counselor.
Long-time camp director Larry Grauvogel (South Bend) says the move fits in well with the history of camp in South Bend. “We’ve always been kind of flexible, switching locations from time to time. Though the commute time will obviously take longer this way, there’s a plus: Servant Camp is open to 8th-10th graders, for whom South Bend camp hasn’t been.”
Servant Camp has has been the week-long home for thousands of campers since its start in 1978. Carmen Lee (Servant Branch) led the camp for 26 of those years until his retirement in 2010.
“Every year we hear stories of how God blessed camp with healings, surprises, interventions in the weather, and great relationships,” says John Zwerneman. “We know that camp is a wonderful part of our life and we are thrilled to be doing it in this new way.
“This will be an exciting new adventure for us in South Bend. Please pray for both branches as we prepare to join together for camp in 2012.”"

						Branches  |  28 Comments",Permanent Link: A Soldier’s Life Is Saved,"By Chris Meehan
US Army specialist Joe Ridenour (Oahu) has been recommended for a commendation for helping save the life of a friend and fellow soldier.  Joe’s urgent phone call led to the rescue of a soldier who had attempted suicide near an army base 2,500 miles away from Joe’s station at Scofield Barracks, Hawaii. The 26-year-old soldier says, “I’m terribly grateful to God for such good friends like Joe.”
Joe vividly remembers the events of  Saturday, November 19. That morning he called his friend Mark Morris (not his real name), who lives near Fort Lewis in Washington State. (The two had met and become friends during communications signal training in Georgia.) Mark told Joe he’d done some heavy drinking by himself on previous weekends, but he brushed it off and said that he was just trying to stay out of trouble.
Joe was concerned, but not overly worried. “Things didn’t seem out of control,” he recalls. Later in the day Joe received several text messages from Mark indicating that he had begun drinking again. Joe decided to call and ask what was wrong. Already drunk, Mark responded angrily, “Nothing’s wrong!” The conversation didn’t go well, and Joe didn’t expect to hear from him again. But then he received more text messages. One said, “I’m sorry.” Another said,”Tell [name], all is forgiven.”
Joe wrote back, “What’s going on?”
“I’m fine,” Mark replied, “Don’t worry about it. Everything is taken care of.”
The tone of resignation in the messages rang alarm bells with Joe, who had taken suicide prevention classes as part of his Army training. He called Mark again, but Mark didn’t answer and the text messages had also stopped. Joe couldn’t be sure that Mark was going to commit suicide, but he says, “the Lord gave me the grace to overcome my pride and take the risk of looking foolish if I had misread the situation.”
He called Josh Pruitt, a soldier at Fort Lewis and a mutual friend, and convinced him to take immediate action. After calling Mark and receiving no answer, Josh dialed 911, and the operator dispatched paramedics. They found Mark unconscious on the floor of his home. He had swallowed all the medicine in his medicine cabinet.
Mark was in intensive care for three days. He remembers waking up in the hospital in a bit of a panic because an oxygen tube was running down his throat, but he doesn’t remember any of the events of November 19.
“I’ve always believed in Christ,” says Mark, but his faith had grown shaky and he says he had become more interested in parties than God. “Now my priorities have changed. I’ve opened up to see the blessing of friends, and to see what’s going on in the world and in myself. Overall, I still have difficult times, but I also see the blessings.
“I’m attending substance abuse classes and Alcoholics Anonymous several times a week. My prayer life is daily instead of weekly or monthly. I’m very open about the experience, always the first to talk about it if it ever comes up. I shamelessly tell the story. It’s in my past–not my future!”
Joe says he and Mark talk on the phone weekly. “We are much, much closer friends.”"

						Branches  |  15 Comments",Permanent Link: A Milestone for Yodit Derese,"By Chris Meehan
Yodit Derese
In June, 2010, Yodit Derese traveled to the US from her native Ethiopia for a surgery to correct a club foot. Her sister Naomi had already been adopted by Eric and Hilary Shreves (Vancouver-Portland), and Yodit, too, became part of the Shreves family, though, at 26, she is too old to be legally adopted. A lifelong Christian with deep faith, she also joined the People of Praise. (Her story appeared in the winter, 2011, issue of Vine & Branches).
Recently,  Yodit reached a significant milestone in her quest to remain in the US  permanently. The US government has recommended that Yodit’s application  for asylum be approved. Once this approval becomes final, she can apply  for a green card (permanent residency). Receiving a green card would  mean that Yodit could become a US citizen.
“I have seen God work in power many times,” Eric says, “but this whole story is one of the greatest miracles I have ever witnessed.”
The recommendation of approval came about through dogged work by Hilary and the help of a Portland immigration lawyer, Theresa Statler. A staff member for US Senator Ron Wyden recommended the lawyer to Hilary and suggested seeking asylum for Yodit under a special provision for members of persecuted social groups.
“I remember the day Yodit and I sat talking to the lawyer for the first time,” Hilary says. “I noticed works of art from all over the world on the walls of her office, especially Asia and Africa, gifts from grateful clients. When she explained all the work involved–weekly meetings for three or four months–I began mentally calculating the enormous expense the effort would require. I had no idea how we could afford it.”
To Yodit and Hilary’s surprise, Ms. Statler paused and said that she sometimes took cases pro bono. She volunteered to work on Yodit’s case for free.
Ms. Statler and her legal team found two professors who had documented the miserable and even dangerous conditions women with disabilities can face in Ethiopia, which buttressed her case for asylum.
Yodit is presently attending school and learning English, and has made friends with other Ethiopian immigrants. “Life in the United States–I love it!” she says. “I love living with my sister Naomi and with the Shreves family. My foot hurts sometimes, but it’s in very good shape now. Praise God!”"

						Branches  |  2 Comments",Permanent Link: In South Bend Back Pain Disappears,"By Chris Meehan
Pete and Megan Sgroi
Early in the afternoon on December 4, Megan Sgroi (South Bend) was pushing her grocery cart up and down the aisles when she felt the pain level in her back rising. She didn’t think she had the strength to finish her shopping, so she left her cart in front of the service desk and hurried home for a rest. She thought about skipping the community meeting at 3:00, but decided she would go and brave her way through it.
She spent most of the meeting lying down at the back of the room. When the meeting ended, Jodi Engles and Claire Kurdelak chatted with Megan and then prayed with her. Megan also asked for healing prayers from Mark Timler, who was serving on the prayer team.
Megan says she didn’t experience any drop in her pain level during the prayer, “but within two or three days I noticed all the pain was gone.”
Now, almost two months later, Megan’s back is still feeling fine. A part-time nurse and mother of five, she no longer has trouble loading the dishwasher, shopping for groceries, sitting at a desk at work or sleeping through the night. “I’m able to do everything I need to do at work and at home,” she says.
Her struggle with back pain began in August, 2010, and seemed to be triggered by a strenuous exercise routine.
“Megan was in pain all the time,” her husband Pete remembers. “She had to lie down several times a day.”
“Pete and the kids would help when they could,” Megan says, “but with him working and five children ages 2 to 11, our hands are pretty full. Life still goes on . . . so I did too.”
An MRI revealed a bulging disc in her lower spine which was pressing on a nerve. After a few months of physical therapy last winter, Megan began receiving spinal injections from an anesthesiologist. One of the injections worked, but six months later the pain returned, as bad as it had ever been. She experienced the pain for about three weeks, before it disappeared again, three days after the December 4 community meeting where she received prayer.
A few weeks after the pain left, at Christmastime, Pete and Megan hosted two dinners for 23 members of Pete’s family. “Megan went well above and beyond the call of duty for us,” says Pete’s mother, Gerry Sgroi (South Bend). “She was carrying on like a house afire for days.
“She couldn’t have done that before.”"

We would celebrate Lord’s Days together with other families, and we’d vacation in northern Michigan with Pete and Beth Walters and their family, and so I had a really rich childhood.
I’m the oldest of five, and when I was in eighth grade my family moved to South Bend. I went to Trinity and then went on to study chemistry at Saint Mary’s College. It was during college that I decided to join the People of Praise. I tried out college life for about a semester and just realized that I could be a good Christian girl by myself, but there had to be more. I saw the more in our life together in the People of Praise, so I wanted to join that.
So, when I was in college, the big question for me was, “What do I do after college?” I was thinking, basically, of being a doctor or a nurse. At that time Medicare had put a pretty significant cap on spending for physical therapy, so jobs were scarce. My line of thinking was, Well, I know there will always be doctors and there will always be nurses, so I’m going to choose one of those. I’m interested in both.
So the summer before my senior year of college I did some research for a foot and ankle surgeon in the Indianapolis branch, Dave Porter. One day during that summer, I got to shadow Genevieve DeCelles, now Genevieve Barrett. She’s a physical therapist and she was working for his clinic. I really loved what I saw her doing, so I thought maybe I should put that onto the options list. So I headed into my senior year and I decided to apply to one physical therapy school and one medical school. What I was really hoping for was that I would get into one and not the other, so that the decision would be really easy. That’s kind of a reflection of what my relationship with the Lord was like at the time. His good, faithful daughter would do anything that he wanted, but I wanted him to tell me, send neon signs. That’s not what happened. I ended up getting into both schools the same month. As I experienced that, I was realizing that the Lord wanted to know how I wanted to build his kingdom.
So, I went ahead and pursued physical therapy school, and I did that in Indianapolis. I lived in the Indianapolis branch during most of that time, lived in household with a family there, and as I was nearing the end of physical therapy school I was again faced with decision-making time. What did I want to do?
At the time, Allendale was about two years old and Dinkytown was just getting off the ground. I visited both places, and by April of my last semester I had gotten to a point where I really thought I could be happy and useful for the Lord in either spot, so both locations had particular draws.
So three weeks before I finished physical therapy school I came back from a clinical I was doing in South Bend. I was in Indianapolis and I had gotten to town a little before the rest of my physical therapy class, so I was kind of looking at free Friday and Saturday evenings, and I really liked to do things with people on those evenings. I particularly loved the Lord’s Day, so I thought, What am I going to do this evening? So I invited two high-school-age women over and we made pizza together and celebrated the Lord’s Day together. Then, as I kept thinking and praying in the days that followed, I realized that my heart had been moved to living and working with college-age women. So I called Genevieve up and asked her where to buy a parka!
Since moving here to Minnesota, my desire to live with college-age women has been blessed a hundredfold. I’ve lived with at least 35 women, and weekly I get to celebrate the Lord’s Day with them and hear about what the Lord has been doing during the week. So currently I’m learning about French diction, public health, pediatric nursing, the Google Art Project, pottery, the WolframAlpha search engine—all these things, because of how we share life and what we’re studying in our household in the campus division.
I’ve also experienced really being able to be a part of our brothers’ and sisters’ lives who have moved on from Dinkytown. One example of this is, recently I was in Allendale for Marie Elise Barrett’s baptism, and at one point we were standing around celebrating the day and thanking the Lord for that, and as I looked around the room I saw Laura Brummer, Colleen Murray and Genevieve Barrett–all sisters I’ve lived with in Dinkytown–and Chris Vieck was there, who was a huge help in getting Dinkytown off the ground, and Ellen Reed, who is a missionary in Evansville now (she taught me calculus at Trinity), so I am just so grateful to the Lord for these relationships and for what he is doing with all of us."

Six members of the Appleton branch made the covenant of the People of Praise on October 22. They include a married couple from Africa, a married couple in their 80s, a retired heavy equipment operator and a single woman who met the community through a church choir.
“The fact that this diverse group of people all found what they were looking for in the People of Praise speaks to the strength of our community life,” says Steve Pable, head of the branch leaders team.
Egide Nimubona and Revocate Niyizonkiza both grew up in Burundi. They met and married in Canada, before a job change for Egide brought the couple to Appleton in 2002. Two months after their arrival, they went to the Appleton airport to celebrate with their friends and fellow African immigrants Peter and Ana Vakunta, who were welcoming their children to the US from Cameroon. The Vakuntas are members of the Appleton branch, and so many branch members were also on hand. Their enthusiasm made an impression.
“When I saw tears in the eyes of some of you waiting for those children, I thought, this is not a normal group!,” Egide says. “I knew right away that this was the group for me.”
Revocate says she was not looking forward to starting over again in Appleton after leaving friends and family behind in Canada. But the fact that community members call one another “brother” and “sister”  made an immediate impression on her. “My brothers and sisters in the community have embraced me and accepted me the same way my biological brothers and sisters do.”
Fred and Dorothy Gedemer were neighbors for more than 30 years who married after their spouses died. Between them they have 10 children, 34 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren, “and we’ve only been married for 10 years!,” Fred quips. The Gedemers heard about the People of Praise from several branch members who were with them on a group trip to Israel. “We found the way the community thinks about the importance of serving others was a good fit with our perspective on serving. We’re like-minded in that way,” Fred says.
The only Appleton native in the group, Emily Siebers works for the book printer, R.R. Donnelley. She heard about the community from branch members in her church choir. “My favorite part of community life is simply going to the weekly meeting and talking to my friends,” she says. “Actually, everyone in the group is a friend of mine!”
Ken Haen is retired from a career in heavy equipment that had him digging lakes in Florida, mining in Kentucky and building coal ships that travel the Great Lakes. He moved to Appleton for work in 2005, leaving behind close friends from a prayer group in Milwaukee. Like the Gedemers, he met David Lee and other branch members on a trip to Israel. “When we got back from the trip we had a party at the community center,” Ken remembers. “I saw that this was what I had been looking for, a group where everybody looked out for everybody and you all had Jesus in your hearts.”
“We all experienced so much joy when these six brothers and sisters made the covenant at our anniversary banquet,” Steve adds. “We felt joy for each person making the covenant and joy for ourselves as these brothers and sisters committed their lives to us.”"

A campus division women’s household lived in the house since last fall. They moved in after two years of major renovations performed largely by visiting Action teams. In late 2009, a commercial developer offered to buy the property as part of an initiative to build student housing near the IUPUI campus. After negotiations with the People of Praise, the developer agreed to cover the cost  of relocating the house about a block away, across the street from Walt and Pam Seale’s home. The women’s household is planning to move back into their home—with a new address and a new basement—before the school year begins.

By Chris Meehan
Troop 77, a Boy Scout troop sponsored by the Muncie branch, celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. With 42 boys, the troop is larger than it has ever been. Members just learned that their scoutmaster, Pete Walters (Muncie), will receive the highest honor a volunteer can earn from the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America–the Silver Beaver. Awarded for “outstanding service to young people over an extended period of time both in Scouting and within the community at large,” the Silver Beaver will be presented at a luncheon on January 21 at Warren Central High School in Indianapolis. Pete was one of 16 to receive the award from a pool of 10,000 eligible volunteers, according to the Crossroads of America council of the Boy Scouts.
Pete and fellow branch leaders Alan Habansky and Tom Schmitt founded the troop in 1986 as a way for the Muncie branch of the People of Praise to serve its sons. “An Eagle Scout for the past 44 years, Pete knows what Boy Scouting can do for our young boys to help them become the young men of God that we want them to become,” says principal branch coordinator Jim Schenkel.
Six years ago, the troop nearly dissolved after membership dwindled to five boys. Pete says the boys deserve much of the credit for its resurgence. “I came up to the boys,” Pete remembers, “and said, ‘Look, guys, I’m busy with a lot of things at home, at work and in the People of Praise. Scouts are boy-led. What are you going to do about growing?’”
One of the scouts, Taylor Davis, suggested that they pray for more members. The boys committed t
hemselves to regular individual and joint prayer, and they took advantage of every opportunity the Lord provided. Scout Peter Coleman (Mission Division, Evansville), remembers discussing the matter that summer with scouts from another troop who were helping him on his Eagle project. It turned out that troop was also down to six members and losing its scoutmaster. After some discussion, those boys and their two assistant leaders joined Troop 77, doubling its size. Since then, more boys keep coming each year. “I might not be receiving this award now if those guys hadn’t prayed and taken the initiative,” says Pete.
Troop 77 is known for its big backpacking trips to places like Colorado and the Upper Peninsula, says Terry Bomkamp, a former Muncie scout leader who has moved to the Rockford branch. He joins Troop 77 each year for the event, handling logistics for the group.
“When I think of Pete, I think of his genuine desire to have a strong personal relationship with each of the scouts,” says troop alumnus Taylor Davis. “I have experienced some of the most difficult times of my life on my high adventure trips with Pete. He is a role model for me, and exemplifies a strong character every day.”
Son and fellow Eagle Scout Justin Walters (Mission Division, Indianapolis) notes that his father is the kind of leader who instituted a penalty of pushups for each time a scout showed up at a meeting without his uniform–and then joined the offender in performing the penalty.
“Our group is a well-mannered gang of all kinds of boys from different churches, different  backgrounds and families,” Pete says. “Troop 77 has not only brought them together as brothers, it’s attracting their fathers as well. Five of them are meeting with five of us men in the branch for an ad hoc sort of men’s group that meets twice a month. They love sharing their lives with one another and they’re telling their friends, who are asking us about it. Who knows where it will end?”"

“Trinity School owes its essence and its very existence to Paul DeCelles—he gave us as a school a love for humanity, for human desires and for the human project.”

Kevin Ranaghan: Paul DeCelles and 30 years of Trinity School

“If Paul DeCelles is to be thought of nautically in relation to Trinity, I have to say, without fear of exaggeration, that he has been Trinity’s architect and builder. He has been Trinity’s captain and navigator and at times its helmsman. He has fulfilled all these functions for more than 30 years. The result is that Trinity floats, sails, survives the tempests, and comes safely to port year after year.”

Elizabeth Grams:
I grew up here in Servant Branch and went to Trinity School. I came underway in the Colorado Springs branch and have belonged to the South Bend branch for almost 10 years now. I’m also a member of the Sisterhood. You may have noticed my name on the videos the community has been putting out, and I’d like to tell you a little bit about that: how I came to do that and what my work with the People of Praise looks like.
In college I studied music and theater. After college I decided to set them aside so that I could live in a campus division household and make myself available to serve the community in any way I could. I spent my evenings writing for Vine & Branches and learning some basic computer programming—this was an effort to help the budding One:Ten Communications division of the LaSalle Company. (I’d say it was more of “an effort” than “help.”) When Sean Connolly asked me to start working for the People of Praise Communications Office, not only in writing but primarily in video production, I had zero experience with video.
I started out in 2007 making filming trips to the South Side of Indianapolis, where our missionaries were then beginning to hold prayer meetings and lay the foundations for Christian community. Kevin Daly, who spent several summers of his college career serving in our communications efforts, taught me how to use our video cameras and edit video footage. We used a computer built and donated to us by Ken Larsen, and got a lot of equipment advice from Tom Bowar.
I work on the Greenlawn property, where Trinity School at Greenlawn, the People of Praise executive offices and the People of Praise growth center are all located. My studio is in Raclin Hall, the growth center building. The building also houses offices of the other communications team members, the property development team and the Center for Christian Studies. I often get to hear updates at our office morning prayer on the latest Action trip, or new properties the community has purchased or renovated. I get to participate in meetings of the growth team, led by Paul DeCelles, who is responsible for all the program offices. I’m always hearing about new things the Lord is doing among our missionaries and in all our branches from Chris Meehan who does reporting for the communications team.
I continue to rely on other brothers and sisters as I do the work I do.
Any time we make changes to the People of Praise web site or post videos in a new location, the folks in One:Ten Communications help us make it happen. In addition, Tom Noe, Dan DeCelles and others associated with the Center for Christian Studies save us from many slips of the tongue. Recently we were able to borrow some lighting equipment from the drama department at Trinity for a large video shoot. The property management team over at Greenlawn helped us make a living room into a studio. In fact, Paul Hommes and Nick Raway, both in Christians in Mission in Indianapolis, came to South Bend recently to donate a few days of their time to renovate a larger filming space for us. Susan Holovaty and Gloria Murphy have done hours of service for the communications team over the last year in transcribing video interviews. Joe Gleason, who volunteered a lot of his time as a college student to our video production, is now working in our department. I could go on and on about brothers and sisters whose names may not be in the credits of our videos but who are truly making it possible for us to communicate as we do.
One day a few months ago, I found myself in a very tight spot when our video camera’s behavior made an apparent change. We were scheduled to film a talk that day, and it was going to be our only chance to get it on camera, but our test footage was looking really funny. Nothing we tried could fix the problem. I started making phone calls to anyone in South Bend I could think of. One man, Jack, called me back immediately and gave me a few suggestions, offering more assistance if I should need it. I did what he said and it worked! He saved the day. I was so grateful to him that I later went to his business to thank him personally. He furrowed his brow, paused, and said, “It’s like that Gospel story–the one who came back.”
“You mean the ten lepers?”
He smiled. “Yes, you’re the one who came back to say thank you.”
Thank you, brothers and sisters, and thank you, Lord, for making it possible for us to labor with you in the Mississippi Valley!"

Gretchen Connolly:
I grew up here in Servant Branch and went to Trinity School back when it was at Gethsemane Episcopal Church in Minneapolis. I came underway when I was in college and moved to South Bend in 1999, where I taught at Trinity School at Greenlawn for five years. Then I moved down to Shreveport and helped with mission work in Allendale for three years. Sean had already been in Shreveport for a year, so we overlapped for a couple of years. After those three years I moved back to South Bend to work for the People of Praise in communications, and that’s when Sean and I started dating. We were married in 2009.
Sean Connolly:
And we have a little girl named Gloria and one on the way, a boy. You might have noticed at Justin and Cathy Walters’s wedding yesterday that he and I have something in common. We’re both corn-fed Indiana boys who married Minnesota girls!
I want to tell you a story about how the Lord has taken care of Gretchen and me. While we were living in Allendale, we were both in households that were financially in common. We were putting a lot of our extra money toward the mission work we were doing, so when we got married we didn’t have a lot of extra change. Our plan was to live on the campus of Trinity School at Greenlawn, in an apartment that’s known as the “launching pad,” because a lot of young married couples have lived there for year or two just after getting married. We were all set to do that too, but a month before our wedding a house came up for sale on Greenlawn Avenue, right across the street from the community’s property. Gretchen and I were very interested in it, because quite a few young singles and some married couples–many of whom work for the community–live either on the property or in houses nearby, so we knew it would be awesome if we could land there. We looked at the house and loved it, and we made an offer, which I admit was pretty low. The couple who were selling the house looked us in the eye and said, “No, thanks.”
So we let it go. We got married and went on our honeymoon. A couple of weeks after that the gentleman who was selling the house called me out of the blue and said, “Another person wants to make an offer on the house, but we like you, and if you want to pay us some more money, we would be glad to sell the house to you.” We knew that if we were going to do it we had to work fast, so I talked to Gretchen and I talked to my head, Paul DeCelles, who works in the same building as I do–which is convenient. Remember, I said we didn’t have much money before we got married, but when we got married brothers and sisters gave us money. In fact, we had a lot more money than I thought we were ever going to have. So, basically in the course of a week we decided that, yes, we could really do this.
Long story short, we got the house, and it has been a blessing to us. Cathy got to live with us in household for the three months before her wedding, and Justin and Cathy are moving into a house whose back yard is literally right behind us. That house is owned by the Sisterhood and they’re renting it to them, and we’re just tickled about that.
We’re just so grateful to all our brothers and sisters in the Lord for taking care of us."

						Branches  |  1 Comment",Permanent Link: Banding Together So All May Believe,"John R. Mott, a Methodist layman and pioneer of the ecumenical movement, helped organize the World Missionary Conference and spread its informal motto, ""the evangelization of the world in this generation.""
Commentary
By Sean Connolly
At a February conference in Rome, Catholic Cardinal Walter Kasper made a bold proposal to Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed leaders: “an ecumenical catechism,” a joint commentary on the Apostles Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer.
That was unthinkable 100 years ago, when a group of Protestants met in Edinburgh, Scotland, for a conference credited with launching the ecumenical movement. The president of the conference read a telegram to the delegates from Anglican leaders containing a single, prescient Scripture verse: John 17:21.
Nowadays, every place the word “ecumenism” goes, John 17:21 follows: scrappy local prayer services, papal encyclicals, harangues over the scandal of a divided Christianity. It’s ecumenism’s ubiquitous theme—Jesus’ prayer to his Father—usually shortened slightly: “that they may all be one . . . so that the world may believe that you have sent me.”
A simple logic governs today’s ecumenical movement: unity comes first. Before “the world may believe,” before Christians can achieve the final clause of John 17:21, we must fulfill the first clause, unity. This translates into lots of high-level dialogues aimed at resolving doctrinal disagreements, but not into much common evangelistic effort.
But there’s another way to read John 17:21—in reverse.
It’s startling to look back from today’s dialogue-heavy ecumenism to discover that the 1910 conference didn’t involve a lick of dialogue.
That meeting—the World Missionary Conference—aimed in a different direction. Organizers like Methodist layman John R. Mott saw great promise for spreading the gospel through the expanding network of railroads. They adopted a motto, “the evangelization of the world in this generation,” and let nothing stand in their way. They invited Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Quakers and others to get together and talk, banning dialogue about doctrine, so they wouldn’t be diverted from conversation about missionary cooperation.
Simple logic. In the words of one Baptist newspaper, “The world has to be evangelized. God wills it.”
The logic produced intriguing possibilities, like cooperating in some foreign mission fields, rather than working in parallel along denominational lines. After all, as delegate Cheng Jingyi put it, “Denominationalism has never interested the Chinese mind. He finds no delight in it, but sometimes he suffers for it!”
Tragically, four years later, this boatload of missionary zeal struck a big rock—World War I. The energy devoted to sending missionaries got diverted into a fight for Europe.
But the boat survived, and soon the same churches began talking about unity. Orthodox Christians joined a conversation in 1920 that eventually yielded the World Council of Churches in 1948. At the Second Vatican Council in 1964, the Roman Catholic Church made an irrevocable commitment to ecumenism.
This thread of discussion about unity leads straight to Cardinal Kasper’s proposed catechism, a joint articulation of the basics, relevant to any future missionary cooperation.
But many veterans are concerned for the ecumenical movement’s future. Ecumenical dialogue “is perhaps in danger of becoming a matter for specialists and thus of moving away from the grassroots,” Cardinal Kasper says.
Anyone who has counted nearly as many churches as people in a small town could agree with Anglican Archbishop N.T. Wright’s remark:  “Let’s not fool ourselves that if we can agree around the table in Rome, this solves all problems of church unity. . . . It’s just the beginning.”
2010 is as ripe with evangelistic possibilities as 1910. The Internet and the global economy are a railway for ideas and people such as the world has never seen. It’s time for all who love ecumenism to pick up the flag of the World Missionary Conference—“the evangelization of the world in this generation”—to seize on opportunities created by fruitful dialogues and bring the ecumenical movement back to the grassroots.
The story of the last 100 years shows Christian unity coming as the direct result of missionary cooperation, not the other way around. John 17:21 is still the right verse—but read it in reverse: By banding together to help the whole world believe, Christians from every denomination might just fulfill our Lord’s great prayer, “that they may all be one.”
Bold missionary action launched the ecumenical movement. The same can see it through to 2110."

US Army specialist Joe Ridenour (Oahu) has been recommended for a commendation for helping save the life of a friend and fellow soldier.  Joe’s urgent phone call led to the rescue of a soldier who had attempted suicide near an army base 2,500 miles away from Joe’s station at Scofield Barracks, Hawaii. The 26-year-old soldier says, “I’m terribly grateful to God for such good friends like Joe.”
Joe vividly remembers the events of  Saturday, November 19. That morning he called his friend Mark Morris (not his real name), who lives near Fort Lewis in Washington State. (The two had met and become friends during communications signal training in Georgia.) Mark told Joe he’d done some heavy drinking by himself on previous weekends, but he brushed it off and said that he was just trying to stay out of trouble.
Joe was concerned, but not overly worried. “Things didn’t seem out of control,” he recalls. Later in the day Joe received several text messages from Mark indicating that he had begun drinking again. Joe decided to call and ask what was wrong. Already drunk, Mark responded angrily, “Nothing’s wrong!” The conversation didn’t go well, and Joe didn’t expect to hear from him again. But then he received more text messages. One said, “I’m sorry.” Another said,”Tell [name], all is forgiven.”
Joe wrote back, “What’s going on?”
“I’m fine,” Mark replied, “Don’t worry about it. Everything is taken care of.”
The tone of resignation in the messages rang alarm bells with Joe, who had taken suicide prevention classes as part of his Army training. He called Mark again, but Mark didn’t answer and the text messages had also stopped. Joe couldn’t be sure that Mark was going to commit suicide, but he says, “the Lord gave me the grace to overcome my pride and take the risk of looking foolish if I had misread the situation.”
He called Josh Pruitt, a soldier at Fort Lewis and a mutual friend, and convinced him to take immediate action. After calling Mark and receiving no answer, Josh dialed 911, and the operator dispatched paramedics. They found Mark unconscious on the floor of his home. He had swallowed all the medicine in his medicine cabinet.
Mark was in intensive care for three days. He remembers waking up in the hospital in a bit of a panic because an oxygen tube was running down his throat, but he doesn’t remember any of the events of November 19.
“I’ve always believed in Christ,” says Mark, but his faith had grown shaky and he says he had become more interested in parties than God. “Now my priorities have changed. I’ve opened up to see the blessing of friends, and to see what’s going on in the world and in myself. Overall, I still have difficult times, but I also see the blessings.
“I’m attending substance abuse classes and Alcoholics Anonymous several times a week. My prayer life is daily instead of weekly or monthly. I’m very open about the experience, always the first to talk about it if it ever comes up. I shamelessly tell the story. It’s in my past–not my future!”
Joe says he and Mark talk on the phone weekly. “We are much, much closer friends.”"

						Branches  |  9 Comments",Permanent Link: Buffalo Branch Braves Epic Snowstorm,"Five-plus feet of snow covered the Shriver farm and Miller home this week.

Story by Elizabeth Grams and Chris Meehan. Photos by Mary Shriver and Lynne Miller.
Buffalo branch members are all safe after five feet of snow fell in parts of their region this week. The total snowfall in some places is expected to reach seven feet by the end of Friday. The region has received almost as much snow in a single week as typically falls during an entire winter.
“It’s been brutal,” says Dave Grzybowski, who spent the week working to remove several feet of snow at his own home and at the nearby church where he works.
Highways and major roads are closed, with hundreds of vehicles still stranded and 12 people reported dead. A driving ban has been in effect in the southern parts of the city, where the snowfall has been heaviest. Schools and businesses throughout the area have been closed since Tuesday, either because they are buried in snow or because their workers are stuck at home.
A few branch members south of town got five feet of snow in 24 hours, but the majority of the branch had less snow, ranging from a few inches to a foot or two.
Greg and Lynne Miller live in Cheektowaga, one of the hardest-hit areas, and they were still snowed in as of Thursday afternoon. Like many, Lynne made an emergency grocery trip on Monday evening when the snow began to fall. “My cart filled with snow as I took the groceries out. It was blowing and snowing. Driving home I couldn’t see. I was praying all the way home, ‘Praise you, Jesus!’ My husband shovelled three times that night. In the morning everything was covered.”
“I haven’t been to work for three days,” said John Gehl on Thursday. “Aside from the fact that it would be difficult to get to work (since the streets haven’t been plowed out), there would be no place to park if I got there!”
John explains that the lake-effect snow blowing in from Lake Erie covered an area shaped like a finger extending from the lake. Buffalo is situated on the northeast corner of the lake, so the eastward-moving snow hit mainly the southern part of town and the southern suburbs.
“We had a little thunder snow on Wednesday night,” says Arlene Meyerhoffer, whose home missed most of the snowfall. “There was booming thunder and snow for 15 minutes.”
Marge Stanley relied on her grandchildren to shovel her out of her home. She has lived in Buffalo all her life and says she has never seen this much snow dumped on the area. “I don’t think we’ve had anything like this, even in the blizzard of ‘77!”
Tom and Theresa Shriver live on a small farm south of Buffalo, where Tom raises turkeys as a side business and Theresa runs a craft shop. They have five feet of snow and counting outside their window, but they still hope to get their turkeys to the butcher this weekend before Thanksgiving and to host the annual open house for Theresa’s shop. Tom has been busy trying to keep some of the snow off the turkey pen and carving paths from the house to the barn and to the pen.
“Snowstorms have frequently kept us out of work and homebound for several days at a time,” Tom points out. “We’ve been through it lots of times over the 35 years we’ve lived here.”
He recalls doing the community’s Provident and Resourceful drill decades ago–living for a weekend without power or without using a car, for example. That drill has come in handy this week: the Shrivers are prepared with both city and well water, a wood-burning stove, and plenty of food in stock. Fortunately, they only lost power for a few hours this time.
By Friday morning, area residents were looking ahead to the next hurdles: removing snow and preparing for a rise in temperature this weekend, possibly with rainfall, that could cause massive flooding from melting snow. Many homes covered in heavy snow already have roof damage. Lynne was busy Thursday removing furniture and belongings from her basement in anticipation of flooding.
Bud Northway emailed the branch to cancel Thursday night’s prayer meeting in Black Rock, but branch members still plan to head to the neighborhood on Saturday morning to pray with neighbors at a soup kitchen.
“It’s nothing the hardy people of Buffalo can’t get through!” says Tom."

						Allendale, Missionary Blog",Permanent Link: Meet the Neighbors,"Meet the Neighbors. For the past month the missionaries in Allendale/Lakeside, David Zimmel, Joe Bulger, and Kevin McShane, have been systematically knocking on every door within several blocks of our new start on Yale Street. “Though the People of Praise has been on Yale Street for more than 12 years, we’ve discovered a great many of our neighbors we have never met,” said David. “We also discovered that by visiting neighbors, running summer camp, and doing neighborhood fix-it projects that our neighbors have a deep respect for our work and really appreciate our presence.” During this latest effort, the missionaries are using a wall sized map to keep track of the homes they have visited and making follow-up visits to homes where no one was available and to homes where people wanted to hear more about our work. (Con’t below photo).
This effort, in part, was initiated to gauge and to understand the degree of interest that our neighbors might have in us forming a grade school. The missionaries have found that many of our neighbors want to talk about educational opportunities for their children. “Not surprisingly, many of our neighbors have really appreciated the opportunity their children have had to attend our annual summer camp,” said David, “and so are interested in what we may be able to do year round.”
“We are not ready to make a decision about establishing a school,” he said, “this effort to meet and speak with our neighbors on the topic of education is a step in that direction.” The current efforts to meet the neighbors has also given the missionaries living in Allendale a wider window into the needs of our neighbors. “We’ve had an opportunity to get to better know people and for them to get to know us and our work,” said David.
David has been impressed with how passionate our neighbors are to raise the next generation for the Lord. Bless the effort Lord!"

Community members in the US gathered together last week to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday. They opened their doors to relatives, fellow community members, travelers and friends. Here are a few examples:


Evansville
In Evansville, preparations began on Wednesday, as missionary sisters cooked up a storm in the kitchen, along with several women and girls from the neighborhood.
“Rather than doing a potluck, we asked people to bring their own ingredients and then we cooked together,” says Chris Vieck.
They made nine pies—six pumpkin and three pecan—as well as 25 mini-pecan pies  and two 9×13 pans of a strawberry dessert with a pretzel crust.
At 7:30 on Thursday morning, missionaries John Earhart and Nick Holovaty began deep-frying six turkeys, one by one, in the backyard. Community sisters peeled, cut, boiled and mashed 50 pounds of potatoes. The food preparation made use of ovens and refrigerators in five different houses of community members.
At 1:00 p.m., 39 people gathered for prayer before splitting into two houses to eat. Attendees included 14 of the missionaries, Casey and Carrie Johnson’s family, twelve neighbors, Claire and Anne Raway (Indianapolis), Chris, Geriann and Mary Raway and Elizabeth Pease (Servant Branch), and Nick Raway, Joe Bulger and David Zimmel (Allendale). After dinner, the group sang old Gospel hymns and new praise songs of their own.
“I really felt close to the Lord in giving thanks together as a community on Thanksgiving,” says Carrie Johnson. “We had all put in the work and experienced the joy of putting on the meal. It was a big highlight in our community life.”


Appleton
In Appleton, Stephen and Jane Buch have been hosting Thanksgiving dinner for around 20 years, keeping an eye out for branch members with no family nearby. This year’s group included Michael and Ruth Schmelzer, Michael’s mother Viola, Barb Oestreich, David Sier (whose wife Joan was traveling), Jane’s sister and brother-in-law and Jane’s four-year-old grandnephew, Sawyer. Dessert included a pumpkin pie made with pumpkin Jane had canned, and was followed by games, including Sheepshead, a popular card game in Wisconsin. (Michael’s mother Viola won, as usual.)
“Just getting together is fun,” Michael says. “Plus it’s fun to go out to eat, and eating out at a brother and sister’s house is better than at a restaurant.”

Colorado Springs
In 2008, John and Katherine Brophy invited Bren and Karen Triplett’s family (all Colorado Springs) for Thanksgiving, since neither the Brophys nor the Tripletts had family in the area. The two families have gathered at the Brophys’ every year since then. This year, John’s parents Tom and Jackie Brophy (Tampa) also came, along with John and Maria Elliot, their daughter Kathryn (all northern Virginia) and their daughter Jane, who teaches at Thomas MacLaren School. Branch members Mark Elio, Jon Grams and Laura Kane, MacLaren teacher Josh Kelly and a friend of John Brophy who is new to the area, also joined them.
“Every year it’s more relaxed,” says Bren. “Josh and I ended up doing the dishes and putting them away, which to me means that Katherine is so comfortable with us doing it, that it’s like we’re really a family of families.”
“John and Katherine have a way of finding a way to fill their house!,” adds Mark. “It was a really joyful gathering, one of my best Thanksgivings ever.”

Vancouver-Portland
In Vancouver-Portland, a group of families has been gathering for a Thanksgiving meal since 2007. Over time the group has grown, so this year they held the gathering at the branch’s community center in Vancouver. They had 54 attendees, including members of the Brotherhood, relatives, college students and a family whose children attend Trinity Academy, as well as a Trinity Academy faculty member and two of her siblings. (A young man who was actually looking for another gathering wandered in and stayed for about half an hour.)
The guests included many transplants to the area from other parts of the US, as well as from Mexico, Lebanon, Ethiopia and Jamaica. The food included traditional fare along with ethnic dishes from around the world. Ramona Castro, who is originally from Mexico, brought homemade guacamole and salsa. Suad Sbait, from Lebanon, brought a cauliflower dish broiled with Indian spices. Yodit Derese brought an Ethiopian dish.
An open mic was the source of some hearty Thanksgiving-themed laughs. Pat Clark told a variety of jokes (How come the pilgrims had trouble holding up their pants? Because their buckles were on their hats!). Martha Olson and Joanna Robinson collaborated on a Thanksgiving rap.
After dinner, the children played a game with a large turkey balloon. One person held the balloon, while a child was blindfolded and armed with a nerf gun. The turkey roved around the room, “gobbling,” while the child tried to shoot it. Peter and Stephen Kabele and Carlos Castro made the game more interesting by setting up obstacles.
“My family are all in Lebanon,” says Suad, who attended the gathering for the first time this year with her daughter Jadwa. “We felt welcomed. It is nice to have brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces here in the community.”"

						Evansville, Missionary Blog",Permanent Link: Be Sober Minded,"Be sober minded. At all times there is great sorrow and great joy in the lives of those around us.
It was Thursday and one of our neighborhood friends had been telling us for days that he wanted to cook for us.
Thursday is melange day, a day where we combine and eat all our leftovers. We had a ton of tasty leftovers and on top of that, our friend was able to join us for dinner and decided to cook up some deep fried pork. We barely had enough room to fit all the food on the table. Our eyes, minds, and hearts were on the food. Surely a gift from God. We sat down and started serving the food. We laughed and joked around knowing that our day was over and all that was scheduled for the rest of the evening was food, fellowship, and sleep. Then Rus’s phone started ringing. It was Job.
Job is a quiet, sober, young man. Whenever we met Job he was caring for us two year old son. His son had been living with him for the past nine months. His girlfriend had left Job for another man very early on and had left the child in his care. Job first came over to tell missionaries that he and his son were getting evicted and were soon to be homeless. He told us that everything seemed to feel better after he talked to us. We went and visited him a week later. He moved into his friend’s small apartment with his son. It was obvious that Job was doing better. One clear thing was his love for his son. I saw him smile once or twice, and each time it was due to something his son was doing. We said goodbye and promised him we would try to see him again sometime. (Con’t below photo)
Gabe Yohe, Nick Holovaty, Nick Raway, Chris Raway.
At dinner, that Thursday evening, began, Rus picked up the phone. His face turned serious. He walked away and talked on the phone in the corner for a while. He turned to us saying, ”The cops are at Job’s house. His wife is trying to take his son. I’m gonna go over there and try to settle things down.”
We all prayed together, and Rus went on his way. Our conversation was much more sober for a while as we discussed the situation. Slowly, however, our conversation became much more jovial. We devoured the scrumptious food and began laughing once again. The food was so good that night. Compared to what we usually had, the pork tasted divine. The only thing that could get my mind off the food was a full stomach. The time flew and then the back door opened.
It was Rus, and he looked torn up but chuckled when he saw our wonderful dinner. Rus told us, ”Job’s ex-girlfriend took the child, and the cops couldn’t do anything about it. Job had no way to fight back legally, and the mother claimed that she had been taking care of the kid all along. Job was irate”
While listening to what happened, we all were hushed and some of us were holding back tears. Job’s former girlfriend simply came and took the child from Job’s arms. There was nothing Job could do about it. Job was powerless. When the mother drove away all Job could do was silently cry. His child and his pride had been taken away from him. Rus drove Job to a friend’s house for the night. On the way Rus and Job discussed what to do. Job could easily go take the child back from the girlfriend but that would land him in prison. There wasn’t much Job could do. He was homeless and now childless and brokenhearted.
Job is our neighbor. When we hear stories like Job’s, we want to help. When we love them we share their sorrow and when they love us they share our joy. Lord, give us a heart for the hurting, the lost and the brokenhearted."

Story by Chris Meehan and Elizabeth Grams. Photo by Andrea Kane.
South Bend branch members collected winter coats, hats, gloves and scarves this November. They sent 925 pounds of coats to Ukrainian refugees and 15 bags of hats, gloves and scarves to a local homeless center.
Coats for Ukraine
Beth Preuss was at a 25th wedding anniversary party for Gus and Karen Zuehlke when she first heard about the need for winter coats in Ukraine. Mike, a former missionary with ties to Christian aid agencies in Ukraine who asked that his real name not be used, planned to send a shipment of coats to help the refugees fleeing the conflict in the South and Eastern parts of the country.
According to a recent UN report, close to one million Ukrainians have sought asylum either within Ukraine, in Russia or in other neighboring states. Many fled their homes last summer, expecting to leave for only a short time, but the continuing conflict has left them with few options.
“Most of the refugees have food to eat and a roof over their heads,” Mike says. “But the refugees lack warm clothes to survive the cold climate.”
With only 13 days to go until the shipment of clothing left the U.S., Beth sprang into action. She contacted the pastor of her church, Christ the King, and spoke with John Lee, the head of Trinity School at Greenlawn, about collecting coats in their locations. Both agreed. Her husband, Rich, volunteered to organize the drive at his workplace. The South Bend branch also ran a notice about the collection in the branch bulletin.
Trinity’s Student Life Committee decided to make the drive part of their annual spirit competition between classes, which led to widespread student participation.
“I was impressed by the high quality of the coats,” says Beth, who sorted and folded many of them with her daughters before bringing them to Mike. “Some were clearly new.”
All in all, Mike filled 19 large boxes with coats from Beth’s three sources and from other South Bend branch members. The total came to 925 pounds, which included 239 jackets, 152 sweaters, 29 coats, 53 pairs of boots, 58 pants, 14 vests, 66 hats, 61 scarves, 32 pairs of gloves, and 24 pairs of socks.
Several families donated money to help with shipping the coats, while a few more families held a bake sale to raise funds for the shipping.
Beth says, “The Holy Spirit was moving in the hearts of all these people in our local area to have compassion on the refugees. I got to see the Lord at work in his people, and I was tremendously moved by it all. ”
The boxes will reach their destinations in Ukraine in time for the Ukrainian Orthodox Christmas, which is celebrated on January 7. Two organizations, Hope to People, in the city of Rivne, and Light in the East, in Kiev, will distribute the supplies to refugee families they support, and to other Ukrainian Christian organizations involved in relief work.
“I am very grateful for the overwhelming response,” Mike wrote to the South Bend branch.
 Hats for the Homeless
Last year the girls in the seventh, eighth and ninth grade youth group collected blankets for the residents of South Bend’s Center for the Homeless.  “This year the center’s executive director was happy to come speak to us personally about the need for other winter clothing,” explains Andrea Kane, who leads the group.  “He even brought a guest resident along, who spoke about her personal experience of homelessness and of getting back on her feet.”
The girls spread the word about the need for hats, scarves and mittens among branch members, and they went door to door in the Kanes’ neighborhood asking for donations. They also made 55 fleece hats and scarves. “All in all we sent 15 large bags and boxes to the homeless center,” says Andrea.
“I feel very grateful for my own coats and my warm clothes,” adds Christin Preuss, a seventh grader. “Just thinking about the people who don’t have those things, I want to help them as much as possible. I thought this was a great way to help, and I felt like the Holy Spirit was in this.”"

Beth Preuss was at a 25th wedding anniversary party for Gus and Karen Zuehlke when she first heard about the need for winter coats in Ukraine. Mike, a former missionary with ties to Christian aid agencies in Ukraine who asked that his real name not be used, planned to send a shipment of coats to help the refugees fleeing the conflict in the South and Eastern parts of the country.
According to a recent UN report, close to one million Ukrainians have sought asylum either within Ukraine, in Russia or in other neighboring states. Many fled their homes last summer, expecting to leave for only a short time, but the continuing conflict has left them with few options.
“Most of the refugees have food to eat and a roof over their heads,” Mike says. “But the refugees lack warm clothes to survive the cold climate.”
With only 13 days to go until the shipment of clothing left the U.S., Beth sprang into action. She contacted the pastor of her church, Christ the King, and spoke with John Lee, the head of Trinity School at Greenlawn, about collecting coats in their locations. Both agreed. Her husband, Rich, volunteered to organize the drive at his workplace. The South Bend branch also ran a notice about the collection in the branch bulletin.
Trinity’s Student Life Committee decided to make the drive part of their annual spirit competition between classes, which led to widespread student participation.
“I was impressed by the high quality of the coats,” says Beth, who sorted and folded many of them with her daughters before bringing them to Mike. “Some were clearly new.”
All in all, Mike filled 19 large boxes with coats from Beth’s three sources and from other South Bend branch members. The total came to 925 pounds, which included 239 jackets, 152 sweaters, 29 coats, 53 pairs of boots, 58 pants, 14 vests, 66 hats, 61 scarves, 32 pairs of gloves, and 24 pairs of socks.
Several families donated money to help with shipping the coats, while a few more families held a bake sale to raise funds for the shipping.
Beth says, “The Holy Spirit was moving in the hearts of all these people in our local area to have compassion on the refugees. I got to see the Lord at work in his people, and I was tremendously moved by it all. ”
The boxes will reach their destinations in Ukraine in time for the Ukrainian Orthodox Christmas, which is celebrated on January 7. Two organizations, Hope to People, in the city of Rivne, and Light in the East, in Kiev, will distribute the supplies to refugee families they support, and to other Ukrainian Christian organizations involved in relief work.
“I am very grateful for the overwhelming response,” Mike wrote to the South Bend branch.
 Hats for the Homeless
Last year the girls in the seventh, eighth and ninth grade youth group collected blankets for the residents of South Bend’s Center for the Homeless.  “This year the center’s executive director was happy to come speak to us personally about the need for other winter clothing,” explains Andrea Kane, who leads the group.  “He even brought a guest resident along, who spoke about her personal experience of homelessness and of getting back on her feet.”
The girls spread the word about the need for hats, scarves and mittens among branch members, and they went door to door in the Kanes’ neighborhood asking for donations. They also made 55 fleece hats and scarves. “All in all we sent 15 large bags and boxes to the homeless center,” says Andrea.
“I feel very grateful for my own coats and my warm clothes,” adds Christin Preuss, a seventh grader. “Just thinking about the people who don’t have those things, I want to help them as much as possible. I thought this was a great way to help, and I felt like the Holy Spirit was in this.”"

The men of the Yakima branch are proclaiming the Gospel in a new way to men in their city. Their method is simple: bring them to men’s group.
Once each month, the men in Gerry Orthmann’s men’s group which also includes Mike Hays, Ron Rice and Jeremiah Orthmann invite other men to join them for brotherhood, discussion and prayer. They’ve been holding these meetings since the spring of 2014. Typically six or eight guests attend each month, and several have started coming regularly.
“A couple of years ago I thought the Lord was prompting me to do something new with my men’s group,” recalls Gerry. “I talked to the guys about what I’d been thinking. Over the years we had invited men to different kinds of activities and events, but we could never really get any traction with those efforts.”
The group prayed and talked for several months before settling on the idea of an open men’s meeting-an idea that Gerry says a friend in Servant Branch, Colin LaVergne, passed on to him. They scheduled their first meeting last May.
“We had invited several guys to join us–neighbors, co­workers and guys from our churches,” says Gerry. “We weren’t really sure how many men would show up, but by 7:00 p.m. we had 10 guys sitting in my living room wondering what was about to happen. I talked very briefly about who we are as People of Praise and about how our men’s group is an important way for us to share life and build friendships as Christian men.”
Then Gerry showed a YouTube video of a skit with two men acting out a conversation between Jesus and Peter. “After the video I led a discussion about Peter being a regular guy like us and having a very personal relationship with Jesus. We had a great conversation about growing in our relationship with the Lord. As they left, some said they really liked it and asked when they could do it again.”
In June, 12 men came to grill bratwursts on Gerry’s porch. At the gathering in July, Gerry gave a short talk on being a Christian man, followed by a discussion. The next month, the men gathered in a local restaurant. Some of the guests had expressed interest in growing in their friendship with the Lord, so the group talked about how to get started with daily prayer and Scripture reading.
Since the summer, the men’s group has continued to plan together for each open meeting according to the needs of their guests. Often the meeting includes a short explanation about the People of Praise (if there’s a new guest), a short talk, discussion, sharings, intercessory prayer and, always, food.
When inviting guests, Mike says, “We let them know that it’s the People of Praise that sponsors this. We tell them that we’re an ecumenical community so they know where we’re coming from.” They do this ahead of time, so the guest can “hit the ground running,” as Gerry puts it, when he shows up at the meeting.
The group has agreed that, if a brother issues an invitation, he is responsible for reminding that man, offering him a ride, and perhaps following up with an invitation to breakfast or a Lord’s Day opening.
“We find that men are yearning for this kind of thing,” says Jeremiah. The meeting “enriches their faith and appeals to them.”
He adds that the meetings have also strengthened their regular men’s group meetings which continue as usual the rest of the month, and been good for him personally. “Being there gives me a jumpstart! It gives me the feeling of a larger brotherhood. It keeps us fresh and optimistic.”
Gerry says, “We tell these men that we’re just regular guys who love God, who want to live our lives as Christian men and want to share our lives with other men. That seems to make a lot of sense to them. It’s been awesome to see the Lord working on these guys. We put in the effort, and clearly the Lord is right in the middle of it.”"

A communitywide Action conference will be held in South Bend from April 8 to 11. The conference is for high school students in grades 9 through 12, and all interested adults.
“We’re aiming to set free more of the energy, creativity and talent that we have in Action, so that we can do more work in the Mississippi Valley,” says Mike Zusi, Action’s program coordinator.
The conference will build on the momentum from the Action conference three years ago, but with a twist. Instead of training exercises, attendees will have chances to get to work, planning and practicing camp activities for this summer, writing songs and producing videos for use in the camps in Allendale and Indianapolis (according to preliminary plans). The conference will also include work groups, news updates, door-to-door canvassing, praise and worship, as well as time for sports and other fun.

At the 2012 conference attendees learned construction skills, went door to door in nearby neighborhoods to pray with neighbors, played sports together and heard updates on our work in the new starts. They also learned a new song by Jared Gonzalez,  “Revive This Land,” and later worked on a collaborative music video for the song that has been viewed close to 19,000 times on YouTube. The Action coaching program also began at the conference. The program provides Action high school students the opportunity to meet regularly with someone-a coach involved in the community’s mission work.
Ben Mysliwiec, now a missionary in Evansville, helped plan the 2012 conference as a high school sophomore from northern Virginia. “The conference gave us a new fire, new confidence and joy.”
“It motivated us to work together and accomplish things,” added Genna Olson (South Bend), a high-school senior who attended the 2012 conference. She has worked on several action trips and plans to attend this year’s conference.
“We ask everyone to pray for the success of the 2015 conference,” says Catherine Bulger, the conference administrator, who adds that she is planning for 200 attendees.  She expects to have a registration form ready tomorrow. “We would also be very grateful for donations to help defray expenses so that many people are able to attend the conference. You can contact me for more details.”"

Story by Sean Connolly. Photo by Benhur Arcayan (Malacanang Photo Bureau) [Public domain] via Wikimedia Commons. Pope Francis is not coming to the U.S. to damn Americans for our wealth or our love of SUVs. He will arrive not as a critic but as a missionary one who will affirm what is best in the US before he challenges our choices. And he is likely to disarm and even charm those of us who believing the pundits are braced for harsh words from the Holy Father. That was the message of a talk on the September visit of Pope Francis by the British journalist Austen Ivereigh delivered in Chicago last week. Ivereigh the author of The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope knows something of Francis’s complex character and his innovative modus operandi. He says the pope is a “political animal the greatest Argentine politician since Perón.” Yet he also “hates confrontation” and is known to be “very anxious about this visit.” It is hard to predict what will happen when Pope Francis brings his signature style — spontaneity openness to the Holy Spirit speaking from the heart — to our shores for the first time. Ivereigh suggests that the big story of the trip will be found in small gestures “particularly when Francis is with the people.” His actions will speak volumes: Pope Francis plans to address Congress and then visit homeless residents of Washington D.C. He will speak at Independence Hall from the same lectern Lincoln used to deliver the Gettysburg Address. The speeches and their inevitable focus on big issues will challenge said Ivereigh but they may not be what most pricks consciences or moves the crowds closer to God. Francis the missionary has many types of arrows in his quiver. As Ivereigh explained in his talk and in his biography the intellectual and political lenses through which Pope Francis sees the US are distinctively Latin American. Jorge Mario Bergoglio has long had political interests. As a child he absorbed the stories of his grandmother a Catholic social activist in Italy before she emigrated to Argentina. In his teenage years Bergoglio went to the meetings of all three political parties and Ivereigh suggests that he may have been “torn between a vocation to the priesthood and a vocation to politics.” He felt an affinity for the popular nationalism of Perón and explored socialism but by the 1970s he had become linked to a group of Uruguayan and Argentine Catholic thinkers — “the River Plate School”. They were part of the liberation theology movement but they rejected Marxism and broke away from better-known liberationist thinkers. Instead of class warfare they valued popular religion and nationalism believing that a renewal of holiness and culture could liberate the poor. Among their leaders was Alberto Methol Ferré a Uruguayan philosopher who Ivereigh says had a strong influence on Bergoglio. Methol Ferré and Bergoglio championed a vision of a unified Latin America which would draw strength from its Catholic roots while avoiding socialism and unchecked free-market capitalism. The ideas of the River Plate School form the intellectual framework through which Pope Francis sees and will challenge Americans but they have been little noticed by US commentators. Ivereigh reports that sadly Methol Ferré’s writings are languishing in boxes in a Montevideo library uncatalogued and un-digitized. When Francis speaks to Congress the media will focus on what he says or doesn’t say about abortion immigration gay marriage and climate change but Ivereigh suggests that a call to renewed political life will be the true heart of his message. Pope Francis wants politicians who are “close to the realities of the people that they serve who are above all attentive to the excluded and the marginalized.” As he showed on his July trip to Bolivia in a speech to members of popular movements he also knows how to bypass the politicians and speak directly to the people tapping into their desire for change. “He comes as a pope with a vocation to renew politics leading change from below” says Ivereigh. This is a moment when change from below is already stirring in America but perhaps its biggest instigator won’t be running for the presidency. Instead he may be a Latin American from an immigrant family one who takes his name from a great populist saint of the 13th-century. As Ivereigh put it “It could be one of the great and defining visits of his pontificate and who knows a historic turning point for the United States.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.
20151017044830,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4764,June 26 2015 5:05 p.m.,Two Houses Arrive in Allendale,"One neighbor on the block told a CIM team member ""I looked out my window and I thought Well I guess someone bought the lot next door!"" Story by Elizabeth Grams. Photos by Laura Brummer Joe Bulger and Jeanette Duddy.  Two new modular houses rolled into the Allendale neighborhood on June 11 and 13. Christians in Mission members cheered as their future homes arrived at 1934 Dove Street and at 1935 Jordan Street. The houses face two different streets but share a backyard. They are two blocks away from the Yale Avenue location where other community households live. “These houses are coming just in time to free up space for our new school” says Mission Coordinator David Zimmel who oversaw the acquisition of the houses. “They are both an answer to prayer and the fruit of our neighbors’ support.” After wiring and plumbing are finished John and Colleen Bowar will live at 1934 Dove which they are renting from another People of Praise couple. Ben and Kathleen Reinhardt currently living at 1434 Yale will move into 1935 Jordan. That will leave the Yale property available for the start of the community’s new school Praise Academy at Lakeside which begins classes at that location on August 11.  Paul Barrett surveys the preparation for the house foundations on Dove and Jordan Streets just a short walk from his family’s home on Yale Ave. Plans were complicated by a recent Shreveport law that prohibited modular housing within the city limits without special permission. In fact last November the city zoning board had denied permission to several petitioners applying for zoning variances for similar types of modular housing. On March 11 David Jeannette Duddy and one of their neighbors Johnny went before the board requesting permits for modular housing at the empty lots on Dove and Jordan Streets. David described the community’s work in the Allendale neighborhood. Then Johnny also spoke in favor of the variance: “The People of Praise are good people. When you need help they’ll help you. When you need a ride they’ll get you. When you’ve got a broken window they’ll fix it. I think you guys got to do everything you can to help them do their project.” “We were really asking for a lot” said David “but the zoning board approved our project unanimously. They caught the spirit of what we’re trying to do thanks especially to the support of Johnny and our other neighbors. Since then everybody I’ve talked to about it agrees that there was some miraculous help from the city to get this going. The guys dropping off the houses asked how did you succeed in getting these houses here?”  John and Colleen Bowar in front of their new home 1934 Dove St. Both houses arrived on trailers in two sections and were placed on concrete foundations laid a few days earlier. The sight of two halves of a house rolling along the hilly Allendale streets drew Christians in Mission team members and other curious Allendale neighbors out of their homes. With the start of the school year coming in August and the arrival of Action teams June 22 the CIM team needed to build quickly to ease their housing crunch--more quickly than volunteer labor would allow. They chose manufactured housing as a cost-effective alternative to traditional construction: in their case says David roughly $50 per square foot instead of $100 per square foot. They wanted new homes that would fit in with the neighborhood’s existing architecture and be affordable to most Allendale neighbors. In the fall David and other team members had viewed one company’s modular homes in their warehouse and he was impressed with their product. “It was kind of a no-brainer. When you’re looking at building a new house you usually have to decide whether it will be inexpensive or fast or well-built. If you’re lucky you get to pick two of those. This company’s houses are all three.”  Patti Deakin Pat Malone and Marianne Duddy watch the new houses coming in. Each of the new homes is designed for common life and hospitality: four bedrooms and three baths with a central open area functioning as the living room dining room and kitchen. Colleen says “I’m really looking forward to moving in. When they put in the house I was talking with two of the women neighbors and realized one of them lives directly across from the new house. It was fun thinking about her being a neighbor.” The new houses are very close together: “Close enough to toss a tomato from one house to the other” says Colleen."

Our new primary school in Shreveport’s Lakeside/Allendale neighborhood opened its doors on Tuesday August 11. Praise Academy at Lakeside started with five students on day one with three more added today (Wednesday) bringing the total to 8. The school is located at 1434 Yale Avenue a house at the center of the row of homes where our Christians in Mission team members live.  The students who range from pre-kindergarteners through fifth graders spent their first day learning about the school environment. The school includes separate spaces for reading math school prayer meals (breakfast and lunch) and naps as well as a charming loft for students to read on their own. The first day also included a nature study using figs from the fig tree in front of Ron and Ruthanne Seitz’s home.   [embed][/embed]   The school day starts with breakfast at 7:45 followed by morning prayer at 8:15. School lets out at 3:10. “Yesterday as I walked down the block I saw CIM team members standing on their porches watching the children gather for the first day of school. We are all excited to see it get off the ground” said David Zimmel who leads the Christians in Mission team.  The staff includes Joan Pingel (principal) Colleen Bowar (teacher and dean of girls) and Kevin McShane (business manager and dean of boys). Angie Simmons a neighbor has volunteered to prepare lunch for the students. Many other CIM team members are playing supporting roles including menu planning security and after school care. Libby Grondin a violinist and Suzuki instructor is teaching music as a volunteer. Word is spreading about the school. “I’ve seen several cars drive slowly by our sign for the school taking down the phone number” David says. He expects more students to enroll this week.

Story by Elizabeth Grams and Chris Meehan. Photo by Rus Lyons. The community’s missionary work extended to Tennessee this summer thanks to two short excursions led by Evansville missionary Rus Lyons. Rus traveled to Nashville July 6-10 and Memphis July 20-25 bringing two brothers in the community with him each time. The men visited poor neighborhoods in each city knocking on doors and talking to people on the street. They shared words from the Lord and prayed with people for healing conversion and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Like Jesus’ first disciples they traveled without definite plans for where they would find food and shelter. They hitched rides from truckers begged for food and water and stayed with local residents who agreed to house them on short notice. The men carried on their persons only a few Bibles notepads rain jackets toiletries IDs a pocket knife and phones with chargers. Rus has made these kinds of “on faith” trips before—13 of them since 2008 but these two trips were the first since 2013. “The Lord put it on Rus’s heart to make these trips” says Mission program coordinator Nick Holovaty “and it seemed to all the Mission leaders like a good time for us to get to know more people as the Lord leads and to get to know what’s going on in more locations up and down our target area in the Mississippi River valley.” In Memphis Rus John Earhart and John Gruber (Servant Branch) preached to a crowd outside a two-story apartment building. “Jesus talks quite a bit about hell” Rus called out to the people on the second-floor balcony “because he doesn't want anyone to go there.” A group of men gathered around a truck in the apartment’s parking lot and interjected frequent questions and replies. One man knelt down on the gravel made a public confession of his sins and recommitted his life to Christ. “There are a lot of people hungry for the Lord in Memphis” observed John Earhart after the trip. In Nashville George Kane Ben Mysliwiec and Rus brought well-timed words of comfort from the Lord. One afternoon they told a man parking his truck that God wanted to fill him with joy. “Wow I needed that” he replied. Moments before he had prayed “I’m afraid to ask you God if it could get any worse.” He explained that he’d recently lost his house and job and his wife had divorced him. On another day the missionaries brought a message of God’s love to a family grieving the loss of a relative. “I was just praying that God would send someone to pray with my family!” a young man in the group told them. The missionaries prayed with the family on their porch and later the man asked to be prayed with for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Along the way the missionaries found food shelter and transportation from all kinds of people. They received rides from a trucker who picked them up on two different occasions and drove them a total of several hundred miles from a pair of gospel singers and from a Sikh who heard from them about Jesus’ resurrection for the first time. One family they met pooled all the money they had in the house–$29–for the three men. Managers at Popeye’s and Hardee’s restaurants provided free meals. A college student who knew a friend of the missionaries put them up for the night. Another family’s 14-year-old daughter used her birthday money to buy them food. A Christian couple whom Jim Schenkel (Muncie) found through his nephew  hosted them a few nights. A young girl who heard they needed food and water ran to grab some cold water bottles from her refrigerator and thrust them into the missionaries’ hands. Rus plans to take at least one more group on a hitchhiking mission in the Mississippi River valley this year. “Please keep praying that the Holy Spirit guide us and revive our land!” he says.
20151017105504,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4677,May 5 2015 10:25 a.m.,"Pope Francis, Tony Palmer, an iPhone & the Holy Spirit",Tony Palmer and Pope Francis. Story by Sean Connolly. Photos courtesy of Life Today.  It all started with an iPhone. On January 14 2014 Tony Palmer a charismatic bishop from a little-known Anglican communion used his phone to shoot a video of a friend—Pope Francis leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics. In the video Francis opened his heart to a group of Pentecostal leaders affiliated with Kenneth Copeland’s ministry. “I am speaking to you as a brother” Francis told them. “Let us allow our yearning to grow because that will allow us find each other to embrace one another and together to worship Jesus Christ as the only Lord of history.” He added: “the miracle of unity has begun.” This is the story of that miracle. Its threads cut through the spiritual divides that separate mainline Protestants Catholics and Pentecostals. But in tracing them the main protagonist is the Holy Spirit which means that anything could happen. The week after recording the video Bishop Palmer traveled to Texas to introduce Francis’s greeting to the Pentecostals. He was uniquely positioned to do so. Palmer had given his life to Jesus in a Pentecostal church in South Africa. He was married to an Italian Catholic. He had become an Anglican priest and bishop and he had adopted a Catholic Cardinal from Buenos Aires named Jorge Mario Bergoglio (later Pope Francis) as one of his spiritual fathers. In a fiery speech that set the stage Palmer read from the 1999 Lutheran-Catholic “Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification.” In that document the two confessions declared that they share a common understanding of the basis for salvation—and therefore that the central theological disagreement of the Reformation had been resolved. As Palmer put it: “The protest is over.” Methodists had joined Lutherans and Catholics in signing the declaration in 2006 yet millions of Christians had never heard of the declaration and so were living their lives as if the protest was still in force. But Palmer didn’t dwell on the past. He had come to the conference to play the role of John the Baptist of a prophet burning to announce something greater that was yet to come. “We are living in an incredibly important generation” he declared. After watching the pope’s greeting on a giant screen the Pentecostal leaders rose to their feet. They prayed for Francis enthusiastically with their hands raised in tongues and in the Spirit. “My dear sir” Kenneth Copeland said. “Thank you so from the bottom of our hearts.” Francis’s greeting was not supposed to become public but the month after the conference in Texas someone posted video from the conference on YouTube. “It went wild” Palmer’s wife Emiliana told me. Palmer was bombarded with emails from evangelicals and Pentecostals who wanted to be part of the unity miracle. Emiliana called Francis wondering what to do. He told her to “let it go” — the wind of the Spirit was blowing. In June 2014 the video led to a meeting in Rome that included Palmer Francis Copeland and another TV preacher James Robison. All told the leaders at the meeting represented more than 1.8 billion Christians including the Pentecostal movement the fastest-growing segment of the church.  Pope Francis and James Robison. The meeting included a two-hour lunch with prayer hugs laughter and even a high-five from Robison to the Pope. Francis as Robison put it spoke fervently “on the need for everyone — Protestant Catholic whatever — to have a personal encounter with Christ.” Lit up by the message Robison said “Sir as an evangelist that deserves a high-five.” Because the video of Palmer’s introduction had shot round the world alongside Francis’s greeting Palmer’s light was shining out perhaps more brightly than it ever had; then just as quickly it went out. On July 20 2014 a car struck the motorcycle Palmer was riding near his home in England. He was in surgery for 10 hours before he died a 48-year-old man who left behind his wife Emiliana and their two young adult children not to mention many shocked Christians. Palmer was born in England and moved to South Africa when he was 10. He met Emiliana there. She came from a wealthy Italian family who had traveled the world before settling in South Africa. Though neither was a practicing Christian during their engagement they attended a conference at the Christian Family Church in Johannesburg. The pastor gave an altar call and Tony and Emiliana went up and dedicated their lives to Jesus. Later that afternoon they went to a party in a wealthy neighborhood. Tony was offered drugs which he had taken in the past but something had changed. Emiliana recalls: “He looked at me and said ‘Emi I don’t belong here anymore.’” They left together. After getting married Tony and Emiliana quit their jobs so they could go full-time as door-to-door evangelists. They hit the streets for eight or nine hours a day watching VHS tapes of Kenneth Copeland’s preaching for inspiration before they went out. According to a video on Copeland’s website the Palmers led 167 families to Christ during that time. During the 1990s the Palmers came in contact with the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. As Tony put it later “When my wife found out that she could be charismatic evangelical Pentecostal and Catholic she wanted to reconnect to her Catholic roots.” Their children were raised Catholic but Tony remained an evangelical. In 2003 Tony got an email from Matteo Calisi a leader in the Catholic charismatic renewal in Italy inviting the Palmers to move to Italy to minister within the Italian Catholic charismatic renewal. But the invitation was conditional on the Palmers raising their own financial support. Just one couple agreed to back them financially Kenneth and Gloria Copeland. The Palmers sold their car and house and used the money to support their new work. While in Italy Tony joined the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches (CEEC) a young Anglican group with its base in Florida that had grown from a circle of charismatic evangelicals who had felt a hunger for the sacraments. With the CEEC Tony became an Anglican priest and later a bishop. The CEEC is a communion that is independent of the Anglican Communion led by the Archbishop of Canterbury but claims historic apostolic succession for its bishops. The story of how Palmer came to be friends with Bergoglio begins in 2003. That year Calisi Palmer’s co-worker helped start an ecumenical group in Argentina. The group brought evangelical and Catholic leaders together for fellowship and prayer and sponsored an annual charismatic rally which Bergoglio began attending in 2004. For the first two years he went as a spectator but something changed in 2006. What happened is related in Austen Ivereigh’s biography The Great Reformer. The cardinal spent the morning as usual seated along with everyone else but in the afternoon he came up to give a speech to the 5000 Christians gathered there. He “asked the preachers first to pray for him and knelt with his head bowed as they held their hands over him” Ivereigh writes. The pastor leading the prayer Norberto Saracco “ended with a crescendo of invocation: ‘Fill him with your Holy Spirit and power Lord! In the name of Jesus!’” Ivereigh describes how Bergoglio then preached with “new fervor” with “passion urgency clarity and strength.” After the conference the cardinal started praying regularly with a group of evangelical pastors. Later he arranged for some of them to preach at retreats for the Catholic priests of the Buenos Aires archdiocese aimed at helping them have a personal relationship with Jesus. Also in 2006 Palmer Calisi and a few others went to visit Bergoglio in connection with their ecumenical work. He asked to hear their stories. Palmer explained how his family attended Catholic mass together but he could not receive communion a fact that had perplexed the Palmers’ children. When he finished “Father Mario just wept” Emiliana told me. (The Palmers usually spoke affectionately of Bergoglio calling him simply “Father Mario.”) Bergoglio asked Palmer if they could keep in touch. With phone calls emails and occasional face-to-face meetings their friendship grew. During one of those conversations Palmer spoke to Bergoglio about whether he should become Catholic. He described the cardinal’s response to Ivereigh: “[Bergoglio] told me that we need to have bridge-builders. He counseled me not to take the step because it looked like I was choosing a side and I would cease to be a bridge-builder.” When Bergoglio was elected as Pope Francis Palmer expected that their friendship would be permanently changed. So he was surprised when after Christmas of 2013 Francis called him at home and asked when he could come to Rome for a visit. During that meeting Palmer told Francis about the Copeland conference asking if Francis would like to send a message. “Why don’t we make a video?” Francis said after a pause. Then he gave the greeting that went viral on YouTube. Palmer’s funeral was held in Bath England a Catholic requiem mass at which Bruno Ierullo a Pentecostal from Toronto and an ecumenical leader who knew Palmer sat near the altar along with the priests and bishops. Emiliana tearfully read a message from Pope Francis: “We were great friends. . . . Those of us who love him feel impelled by his zeal to follow in his footsteps to walk without rest preparing the bride one single bride for the bridegroom who will come.” In October Francis met with Emiliana and a contingent of bishops from the CEEC. He announced that Emiliana and Archbishop Robert Wise had agreed to “carry the torch this dream which was Tony’s: this dream of being able to walk in communion.” It is too early to tell what will come next in this work that the Holy Spirit brought about through Tony and Francis. The wound of Tony’s death is still raw and from the moment Tony took out his iPhone no one was following a script. One possibility stems from a draft document that Palmer Copeland and Robison brought to Francis in June 2014. Ivereigh spoke to Palmer just after the meeting “Palmer told me the draft declaration has three elements: the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed which Catholics and evangelicals share; the core of the Catholic-Lutheran declaration of 1999 making clear there is no disagreement over justification by faith; as well as a final section asserting that Catholics and evangelicals are now ‘united in mission because we are declaring the same Gospel.’” Palmer’s hope was that Protestant and Catholic leaders would sign the document sometime in 2017 during the 500th anniversary of the Reformation and the 50th anniversary of the Catholic charismatic renewal. “I’m convinced that this is a highly significant historical moment” Ivereigh told me. “We will look back and say this was the moment where Catholics and evangelicals came together.” The key says Ivereigh is not simply Francis’s openness to building friendships across denominations but the fact that Francis is charismatic. “All Catholic charismatics should now be saying that this is a charismatic pope—he is. And that’s why Copeland and Robison and these others are responding to Francis. They’re saying look this guy is a man of the Spirit. He is a Spirit-filled pope responding to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and discerning that this is the moment the kairos and that he must do what he can to bring this about.” This miracle of unity began with something small: a private video message that become public. It fueled a coming together of Tony’s evangelical and Pentecostal friends with his Catholic friend Francis while sweeping in hundreds of thousands of others through a 21st century spiritual agent—YouTube. For it to grow larger still requires something even more profound the fulfillment by the Spirit of an ancient spiritual promise: “Unless a grain falls into the earth and dies it remains just a single grain; but if it dies it bears much fruit.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.

20160125122346,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4821,Sept. 1 2015 10:11 a.m.,What To Expect When You're Expecting Pope Francis,Pope Francis visited victims of Typhoon Yolanda in January. Story by Sean Connolly. Photo by Benhur Arcayan (Malacanang Photo Bureau) [Public domain] via Wikimedia Commons. Pope Francis is not coming to the U.S. to damn Americans for our wealth or our love of SUVs. He will arrive not as a critic but as a missionary one who will affirm what is best in the US before he challenges our choices. And he is likely to disarm and even charm those of us who believing the pundits are braced for harsh words from the Holy Father. That was the message of a talk on the September visit of Pope Francis by the British journalist Austen Ivereigh delivered in Chicago last week. Ivereigh the author of The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope knows something of Francis’s complex character and his innovative modus operandi. He says the pope is a “political animal the greatest Argentine politician since Perón.” Yet he also “hates confrontation” and is known to be “very anxious about this visit.” It is hard to predict what will happen when Pope Francis brings his signature style — spontaneity openness to the Holy Spirit speaking from the heart — to our shores for the first time. Ivereigh suggests that the big story of the trip will be found in small gestures “particularly when Francis is with the people.” His actions will speak volumes: Pope Francis plans to address Congress and then visit homeless residents of Washington D.C. He will speak at Independence Hall from the same lectern Lincoln used to deliver the Gettysburg Address. The speeches and their inevitable focus on big issues will challenge said Ivereigh but they may not be what most pricks consciences or moves the crowds closer to God. Francis the missionary has many types of arrows in his quiver. As Ivereigh explained in his talk and in his biography the intellectual and political lenses through which Pope Francis sees the US are distinctively Latin American. Jorge Mario Bergoglio has long had political interests. As a child he absorbed the stories of his grandmother a Catholic social activist in Italy before she emigrated to Argentina. In his teenage years Bergoglio went to the meetings of all three political parties and Ivereigh suggests that he may have been “torn between a vocation to the priesthood and a vocation to politics.” He felt an affinity for the popular nationalism of Perón and explored socialism but by the 1970s he had become linked to a group of Uruguayan and Argentine Catholic thinkers — “the River Plate School”. They were part of the liberation theology movement but they rejected Marxism and broke away from better-known liberationist thinkers. Instead of class warfare they valued popular religion and nationalism believing that a renewal of holiness and culture could liberate the poor. Among their leaders was Alberto Methol Ferré a Uruguayan philosopher who Ivereigh says had a strong influence on Bergoglio. Methol Ferré and Bergoglio championed a vision of a unified Latin America which would draw strength from its Catholic roots while avoiding socialism and unchecked free-market capitalism. The ideas of the River Plate School form the intellectual framework through which Pope Francis sees and will challenge Americans but they have been little noticed by US commentators. Ivereigh reports that sadly Methol Ferré’s writings are languishing in boxes in a Montevideo library uncatalogued and un-digitized. When Francis speaks to Congress the media will focus on what he says or doesn’t say about abortion immigration gay marriage and climate change but Ivereigh suggests that a call to renewed political life will be the true heart of his message. Pope Francis wants politicians who are “close to the realities of the people that they serve who are above all attentive to the excluded and the marginalized.” As he showed on his July trip to Bolivia in a speech to members of popular movements he also knows how to bypass the politicians and speak directly to the people tapping into their desire for change. “He comes as a pope with a vocation to renew politics leading change from below” says Ivereigh. This is a moment when change from below is already stirring in America but perhaps its biggest instigator won’t be running for the presidency. Instead he may be a Latin American from an immigrant family one who takes his name from a great populist saint of the 13th-century. As Ivereigh put it “It could be one of the great and defining visits of his pontificate and who knows a historic turning point for the United States.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.
20160304034432,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1938,June 16 2011 9:20 p.m.,Trinity Academy to Begin This Fall in Vancouver-Portland,"By Chris Meehan  This fall's ninth grade class at Trinity Academy. From left Carlos Castro Stephen Kabele Naomi Shreves and Peter Kabele. (Photo credit: Glenn Rymsza). This fall the Vancouver-Portland branch will open a school in the Kenton area of Portland. The venture named Trinity Academy will begin by offering ninth-grade classes to four children of branch members. ""We are starting out small but we have high hopes for the future” says Vancouver-Portland branch’s principal branch coordinator Charlie Fraga. “We’ve been researching the possibility of a school for years. Finally now seems the time to start."" He adds that the school will fit in well with the branch's other city-building efforts in Kenton. The new school will use a version of the Trinity School curriculum adapted by The Academy Project a company owned and directed by Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) head of school for Trinity School at Meadow View.  Although Trinity Academy in the Vancouver-Portland branch will not be a Trinity School campus at the start branch leaders hope the school will grow toward that goal.  Jo Clark will lead the new Trinity Academy in the fall. Jo Clark a member of the branch with a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Georgetown University will be leaving her position as adjunct professor of chemistry at the University of Portland to become the head of school. The faculty will include various members of the branch each working part-time. Classes will be held in a variety of locations around Kenton explains Eric Shreves whose daughter Naomi will attend the school. “Our hope is that our students will be able to use the basement of the former rectory we own as home base where Jo would teach Humane Letters and walk to Charlie Fraga’s nearby Direct Development office to study Latin with Pat Clark who works there then perhaps meet up with Glenn Rymsza at a portable classroom on the grounds of De La Salle High School located a block away for Scripture or doctrine.” “This decision came after a considerable process of prayer and discernment” says Charlie. ""We received input from branch members from a feasibility study group comprised of some of the branch coordinators and prospective parents and from many people with experience working for Trinity Schools."" “The strength of character of these particular children was a key factor in the decision to move now” adds Jo. “We felt they could handle any difficulties caused by being the inaugural class and would go on to become leaders for newer students.” The inaugural student body consists of four ninth-graders: Carlos Castro Naomi Shreves and twins Peter and Stephen Kabele. After participating in the planning they are all on board with the project. Naomi (15) is excited to get started. “I’m hoping people will see us walking to and from class and recognize our uniforms and know who we are. I’m looking forward to a great education. It also looks like we’ll be able to take part in sports programs at nearby public schools.” Peter Kabele (14) was happy he had a say in how the school was formed and says all his friends “are okay” with the prospect of him attending another school. His brother Stephen is happy he’ll still be eligible to participate in activities such as band or choir at public schools if he chooses to. He even hopes to recruit a few more students before school starts. Carlos Castro (14) says he’ll enjoy walking between classes. Like the others he looks forward to the personal attention he’ll receive because of the school’s small size and appreciates everyone’s efforts to overcome the challenges that come from being so small. “I heard some things about Trinity from friends who live in northern Virginia and they really enjoy it.” “If this experiment works and we do grow larger and strong enough to become a Trinity School campus” Charlie says “it might be a model for how people in other small branches can give their children a Trinity School education. For now please pray that we can discover other students who might be candidates for joining us in this initiative before the school’s opening in September.”"

Trinity and Wilberforce faculty members on hand for faculty training joined them. Story by Sean Connolly. Photo by Jon Balsbaugh. A new high school will open its doors in Princeton New Jersey this fall thanks to a partnership between Trinity Schools and The Wilberforce School. The Wilberforce School (TWS) is an independent Christian school with 160 students. This year it is adding ninth and tenth grades to its previous pre-K through 8th grade offerings and the school expects to add 11th and 12th grades in coming years. Wilberforce high school students will follow Trinity’s curriculum in their math science and humanities courses and their teachers will receive ongoing training from Trinity master teachers. This makes the high school at Wilberforce the first of its type — a school that will license the Trinity curriculum and maintain an ongoing training relationship with Trinity’s teachers and administrative leaders. To reflect these close ties the school has a new designation Trinity Member School which it is already using in its marketing materials. Howe Whitman head of school at TWS and Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools Inc. signed a contract formalizing the partnership on August 6. “It has been a joy to work with everybody at Trinity” Howe says. “When Wilberforce leaders learned about Trinity’s approach it seemed like the natural conclusion to the education we are already offering to lower and middle school students. We wanted to be able to offer those students the same kind of challenging and deep education that Trinity high school students receive an education that honors God and focuses on the true the good and the beautiful.” “I am very pleased” Kerry adds. “This is a new way for Trinity Schools and for the People of Praise to fulfill our goal of educating as many students as we can in a true and integral Christian humanism. We have been very impressed by the academic excellence at Wilberforce and by their leaders’ commitment to a Christian vision for education.” The new partnership is the result of two years of prayer conversation and work on the part of Howe Karen Ristuccia (TWS academic dean) and other TWS leaders together with Kerry Andrew Zwerneman (head of school at Trinity School at Meadow View) Paul Kane (Trinity’s vice-president of finance) and members of the Trinity School board of trustees. Connections between TWS and Trinity Schools go back to at least 2002 when Paul and Howe got to know each other through Paul’s brother Leo. Coincidentally Karen began to hear about Trinity through her nephews Justin and Jonathan Young who both graduated from Trinity School at Meadow View in Virginia. She visited the campus in 2011 and later that year Howe and a team from TWS also visited with Andrew and others at Meadow View. In 2012 Howe and Kerry began to talk seriously about the partnership. Then in January of 2013 Andrew and two Meadow View students Ben Mysliwiec and Mollie Clement traveled to Princeton to speak about Trinity to a gathering of TWS parents. This fall former Meadow View teacher Katherine Krall who recently moved to Princeton will become the first ninth-grade Humane Letters teacher at TWS. Another connection came in 2012 when a team from the People of Praise communications office (Greenlawn Films) produced a marketing video for TWS. There are already many similarities between Wilberforce and Trinity. Both started small and both began holding their classes in church buildings. Both school cultures feature small classes daily morning prayer and close relationships between teachers and students. Both admit students from a variety of Christian denominations and both have reputations for academic excellence.  A group of Christian parents founded TWS in 2005 naming it in honor of a British abolitionist and Christian member of parliament William Wilberforce (1759-1833). Fifteen students are enrolled in the new high school and Howe expects the enrollment to grow. The high school has already attracted some graduating TWS eighth graders. Howe says the high school classes will start out with boys and girls together but they will transition to single-sex classes in the future. “I want it to be as much like a Trinity School as possible” he says. Kerry adds “We’ve been very successful in spreading our curriculum in the past but this partnership gives a new dimension to our work. We are very grateful to the Lord to be working with The Wilberforce School in this mutual endeavor.”

They came from African American congregations from Methodist and nondenominational churches and from Muncie’s Roman Catholic parishes. Deliverance Temple hosted the service the first of its kind in Muncie since 2009. According to Deacon Jim Rush an ecumenical officer for the local Catholic diocese the service would not have happened this year without Jim Schenkel and the support of the Muncie branch of the People of Praise. Mr. Rush began looking for someone to organize the service in early 2015. After the third person told him to talk with Jim Schenkel Mr. Rush got in touch with him and Jim ultimately agreed to spearhead the service. He sent flyers to every church in the city (roughly 130 churches) took out newspaper ads and ads in church bulletins. He even spoke before the city council about the event. A turning point came when Jim met Rev. Andre Mitchell of Deliverance Temple at a pastors’ meeting and Rev. Mitchell asked Jim why he had come. “I believe that God sent me here” Jim replied. Rev. Mitchell took Jim seriously and ultimately agreed to host the service at Deliverance Temple. “We shared a brotherly bond from the start” Rev. Mitchell said. Ten pastors and Christian leaders agreed to participate and stood together at the front of the church. Jim as emcee called on Bill Bolka (Muncie) to lead the group in “Amazing Grace” with his guitar. Men and women from different churches read Scripture passages. Then Peter Walters (Muncie) gave a talk on John 17. He said that Jesus’ heartfelt words on unity spoken on the night before he died showed how important the unity of Christians is to God. In keeping with that theme the service ended with the song “Father Make Us One.” Those words resonated with Rev. Andre Mitchell and his father Rev. Royce Mitchell who founded Deliverance Temple. “John 17 was my father’s theme passage for 25 years” Rev. Andre Mitchell explained. Later Rev. Andre Mitchell took Pete over to a mural painted on the wall. It showed a Bible open to the words of Jesus’ prayer in John 17 with the words “Lord Make Us One.” “I've always had an interest in promoting Christian unity but I’ve never been to a gathering like this” Rev. Royce Mitchell said. “This was the largest number of Catholics we've had in the church at one time.” Following the service Muncie branch members served a simple lunch and many of the people stayed to eat and talk together. The event surpassed Mr. Rush’s expectations. “It was a huge success. It gives us much to build on. It was wonderful to have an ecumenical group like the People of Praise support it.”

Photos courtesy of Elizabeth Adams Frank Bassett Maria Elliott and Bill Sjoberg. After the massive snowstorm dubbed “Snowzilla” hit the east coast of the United States this weekend brothers and sisters in the northern Virginia branch are still standing . . . in up to three feet of snow.  “So far everyone seems to be okay” says Principal Branch Coordinator Bob Magill. “We’re ready to look out for each other. It’ll take us a couple days to dig out.” The storm also brought heavy winds thunder and lightning to the D.C. area on Friday and Saturday leaving many people looking at two or more feet of snow outside their windows by Sunday morning. While children got busy building snow forts and sledding men in the branch took on driveways and sidewalks with their shovels and the occasional snowblower even as another round of snow fell Sunday afternoon.    In the branch’s south area coordinator Rick Ridenour enlisted men’s groups to look after the needs of those less able. John Elliott Dave Baldwin and Lee Smith worked from about 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday removing snow for single women and elderly members of the area as well as for other neighbors. As they travelled from neighborhood to neighborhood with John’s snowblower and some shovels more men from the area joined them in each spot. “First they had to clear part of the street just to get to my house” said Barbara Moore a branch member who lives alone. “The men labored so hard and so long yesterday. I’m grateful to them and to the People of Praise.”    Bill Sjoberg a meteorologist who works for a government weather agency started a branch email chain that well snowballed over the course of the weekend. He told everyone the proper way to measure the snow in their yards and reports came in steadily from different parts of the branch. While power outages and flooding have affected other parts of the East coast and at least 21 deaths associated with the storm have been reported life in the D.C. area has simply come to a halt. Branch offices and Trinity School at Meadow View along with public schools and government offices will remain closed at least through Tuesday. Flooding and water damage are a risk for the area when the snow melts.    For the moment branch members are taking the snow day to spend time with one another in their homes gathering for meals and games and traveling mostly by foot. “It’s been a time for family and fellowship” says Bill.

Craig Lent has appointed Ron Gouveia as the new principal branch coordinator for the Oahu branch. Ron began a six-year term on October 15 2015. He follows Tom Duddy who served three consecutive six-year terms. Ron 67 is a tenured coordinator and one of the men who led the Light of Christ prayer group whose members became the Oahu branch of the People of Praise in 1983. A lifelong Oahu resident Ron has one daughter Sharon and a son Jonathan from his 36-year marriage to his wife Carrie who died in 2006. He works as a certified public accountant and plans to retire in 2017. “I’m grateful for Ron’s willingness to accept the responsibility for leading the branch” Craig said. “Ron has been a faithful leader in Oahu for many years and has the trust and affection of his brothers and sisters in Christ.” Ron and Tom in addition to being neighbors within the same condominium are long-time brothers in the community. The Duddys came to Oahu in 1980 on a Navy commission and had their first ever Lord’s Day dinner with Ron and Carrie Gouveia’s household. On October 4 the Oahu branch devoted their annual community celebration meeting to honoring and thanking Tom and his wife Mary for their years of service.    “Tom served unselfishly humbly generously with a great passion to be the servant of all” Donald Busekrus said. Branch members recalled his accordion-playing skills his passion for birding and his annual role as Santa Claus passing out gifts to branch children. “The kids all like ‘Uncle Tom’” said Bob Linczer. Throughout his tenure as PBC Tom worked full-time as a legal assistant specializing in medical malpractice while Mary worked first as a parish secretary then for the marriage tribunal of the local Catholic diocese. Of Mary Alana Busekrus said ""She is always eager to share life with others by serving them. She brings meals to new moms or to sick community members helps with cleaning or moving and prays over or reaches out to those in need sharing her contagious humor and joy.""  “Tom did a wonderful job” Kevin Ranaghan said. “He was personally available for pastoral help for anyone in the branch. He always made a strong contribution to the branch review meetings every spring. I have the highest respect for his long service. He and Mary are known for their hospitality; they hosted many guests over the years.”"

Story by Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly. Photo by Lisa Ficker. Trinity Academy in Portland began its fifth year in September with 59 students in grades 6 to 12 up from 46 last year and a faculty and staff of 21. Along with the growth Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools has announced that the school has become a new Trinity Member School. This means Trinity Academy will license the Trinity curriculum and maintain an ongoing training relationship with Trinity's teachers and administrative leaders. Trinity Academy joins The Wilberforce School in Princeton NJ as a Trinity Member School. ""Trinity Academy's development has been quick and they've created a wonderful school"" Kerry said. ""Head of School Jo Clark and her staff have done a fantastic job."" The school's growth has led to other changes: just last year it had moved into a 10000-square-foot building but this year's increase in enrollment demanded more space. The landlord local Christian businessman Haddish Tarekegn had the remaining empty floor remodeled over the summer to give the academy two new classrooms a bigger common space and a significantly larger faculty room. The school's ninth grade humane letters class is now taught in separate sections for boys and girls and the school intends to add other separate classes in the future a move that makes Trinity Academy ""more like our model Trinity Schools"" Jo Clark said. Trinity Academy has attracted new faculty and staff from other branches of the community and elsewhere. This year the school hired Patrick Gaffney (formerly of Servant Branch) and Martha Olson (Vancouver-Portland) to teach full-time. Lisa Ficker (formerly of South Bend) is now serving as a school administrator. All three are graduates of Trinity School at River Ridge. ""The people attracted me to the school"" said third-year faculty member Chelsea Jones.  Several months after she started teaching Chelsea decided to join the People of Praise. ""After my interviews for employment Jo invited me over for dinner with her family. Her next door neighbors the Kabeles and her sister and brother-in-law the Shreveses were also there. They were some of the kindest holiest people I had ever met. After that I was all in."" Two formerly part-time teachers Dr. Francie Longshore and Patrick Tomassi have shifted to teaching full-time this year bringing the total of full-time faculty to eight. The school currently has 11 part-time faculty and staff as well. Members of the Vancouver-Portland branch many of whom are not parents of Trinity Academy students serve on the school board and advisory council. Charlie Fraga president of the school board said Trinity Academy's growth is due in part to branch members who live near the school telling their neighbors about it. As a result many Trinity Academy families became familiar with the People of Praise. ""These parents know us and trust us so they are sending their kids to our school"" Charlie said. Forty-eight of the school's students come from families outside the People of Praise. Charlie added that the school's growth has also resulted in growth in the branch and in its Action team and has caused a resurgence in community households. ""The three members moving here from other branches are single and they wanted to live in household. That's a good development for our branch."" Trinity Academy was founded by the Vancouver-Portland branch in 2011. From the beginning the faculty were trained in the Trinity approach by Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) and his Academy Project which aims to offer Trinity's vision of Christian education to independent schools. ""Andrew and his team were invaluable in the launching of Trinity Academy"" Jo said. ""In countless phone calls emails and trips to Portland they provided excellent counsel and training for us and they called us on with faithful encouragement."" Last year the school graduated its first class of five students. Jo commented ""Members of our first graduating class were accepted at some great colleges including the University of Notre Dame and Holy Cross College."""

Story by Sean Connolly. Photo by Benhur Arcayan (Malacanang Photo Bureau) [Public domain] via Wikimedia Commons. Pope Francis is not coming to the U.S. to damn Americans for our wealth or our love of SUVs. He will arrive not as a critic but as a missionary one who will affirm what is best in the US before he challenges our choices. And he is likely to disarm and even charm those of us who believing the pundits are braced for harsh words from the Holy Father. That was the message of a talk on the September visit of Pope Francis by the British journalist Austen Ivereigh delivered in Chicago last week. Ivereigh the author of The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope knows something of Francis’s complex character and his innovative modus operandi. He says the pope is a “political animal the greatest Argentine politician since Perón.” Yet he also “hates confrontation” and is known to be “very anxious about this visit.” It is hard to predict what will happen when Pope Francis brings his signature style — spontaneity openness to the Holy Spirit speaking from the heart — to our shores for the first time. Ivereigh suggests that the big story of the trip will be found in small gestures “particularly when Francis is with the people.” His actions will speak volumes: Pope Francis plans to address Congress and then visit homeless residents of Washington D.C. He will speak at Independence Hall from the same lectern Lincoln used to deliver the Gettysburg Address. The speeches and their inevitable focus on big issues will challenge said Ivereigh but they may not be what most pricks consciences or moves the crowds closer to God. Francis the missionary has many types of arrows in his quiver. As Ivereigh explained in his talk and in his biography the intellectual and political lenses through which Pope Francis sees the US are distinctively Latin American. Jorge Mario Bergoglio has long had political interests. As a child he absorbed the stories of his grandmother a Catholic social activist in Italy before she emigrated to Argentina. In his teenage years Bergoglio went to the meetings of all three political parties and Ivereigh suggests that he may have been “torn between a vocation to the priesthood and a vocation to politics.” He felt an affinity for the popular nationalism of Perón and explored socialism but by the 1970s he had become linked to a group of Uruguayan and Argentine Catholic thinkers — “the River Plate School”. They were part of the liberation theology movement but they rejected Marxism and broke away from better-known liberationist thinkers. Instead of class warfare they valued popular religion and nationalism believing that a renewal of holiness and culture could liberate the poor. Among their leaders was Alberto Methol Ferré a Uruguayan philosopher who Ivereigh says had a strong influence on Bergoglio. Methol Ferré and Bergoglio championed a vision of a unified Latin America which would draw strength from its Catholic roots while avoiding socialism and unchecked free-market capitalism. The ideas of the River Plate School form the intellectual framework through which Pope Francis sees and will challenge Americans but they have been little noticed by US commentators. Ivereigh reports that sadly Methol Ferré’s writings are languishing in boxes in a Montevideo library uncatalogued and un-digitized. When Francis speaks to Congress the media will focus on what he says or doesn’t say about abortion immigration gay marriage and climate change but Ivereigh suggests that a call to renewed political life will be the true heart of his message. Pope Francis wants politicians who are “close to the realities of the people that they serve who are above all attentive to the excluded and the marginalized.” As he showed on his July trip to Bolivia in a speech to members of popular movements he also knows how to bypass the politicians and speak directly to the people tapping into their desire for change. “He comes as a pope with a vocation to renew politics leading change from below” says Ivereigh. This is a moment when change from below is already stirring in America but perhaps its biggest instigator won’t be running for the presidency. Instead he may be a Latin American from an immigrant family one who takes his name from a great populist saint of the 13th-century. As Ivereigh put it “It could be one of the great and defining visits of his pontificate and who knows a historic turning point for the United States.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.

Story by Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly. Photo by Lisa Ficker. Trinity Academy in Portland began its fifth year in September with 59 students in grades 6 to 12 up from 46 last year and a faculty and staff of 21. Along with the growth Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools has announced that the school has become a new Trinity Member School. This means Trinity Academy will license the Trinity curriculum and maintain an ongoing training relationship with Trinity's teachers and administrative leaders. Trinity Academy joins The Wilberforce School in Princeton NJ as a Trinity Member School. ""Trinity Academy's development has been quick and they've created a wonderful school"" Kerry said. ""Head of School Jo Clark and her staff have done a fantastic job."" The school's growth has led to other changes: just last year it had moved into a 10000-square-foot building but this year's increase in enrollment demanded more space. The landlord local Christian businessman Haddish Tarekegn had the remaining empty floor remodeled over the summer to give the academy two new classrooms a bigger common space and a significantly larger faculty room. The school's ninth grade humane letters class is now taught in separate sections for boys and girls and the school intends to add other separate classes in the future a move that makes Trinity Academy ""more like our model Trinity Schools"" Jo Clark said. Trinity Academy has attracted new faculty and staff from other branches of the community and elsewhere. This year the school hired Patrick Gaffney (formerly of Servant Branch) and Martha Olson (Vancouver-Portland) to teach full-time. Lisa Ficker (formerly of South Bend) is now serving as a school administrator. All three are graduates of Trinity School at River Ridge. ""The people attracted me to the school"" said third-year faculty member Chelsea Jones.  Several months after she started teaching Chelsea decided to join the People of Praise. ""After my interviews for employment Jo invited me over for dinner with her family. Her next door neighbors the Kabeles and her sister and brother-in-law the Shreveses were also there. They were some of the kindest holiest people I had ever met. After that I was all in."" Two formerly part-time teachers Dr. Francie Longshore and Patrick Tomassi have shifted to teaching full-time this year bringing the total of full-time faculty to eight. The school currently has 11 part-time faculty and staff as well. Members of the Vancouver-Portland branch many of whom are not parents of Trinity Academy students serve on the school board and advisory council. Charlie Fraga president of the school board said Trinity Academy's growth is due in part to branch members who live near the school telling their neighbors about it. As a result many Trinity Academy families became familiar with the People of Praise. ""These parents know us and trust us so they are sending their kids to our school"" Charlie said. Forty-eight of the school's students come from families outside the People of Praise. Charlie added that the school's growth has also resulted in growth in the branch and in its Action team and has caused a resurgence in community households. ""The three members moving here from other branches are single and they wanted to live in household. That's a good development for our branch."" Trinity Academy was founded by the Vancouver-Portland branch in 2011. From the beginning the faculty were trained in the Trinity approach by Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) and his Academy Project which aims to offer Trinity's vision of Christian education to independent schools. ""Andrew and his team were invaluable in the launching of Trinity Academy"" Jo said. ""In countless phone calls emails and trips to Portland they provided excellent counsel and training for us and they called us on with faithful encouragement."" Last year the school graduated its first class of five students. Jo commented ""Members of our first graduating class were accepted at some great colleges including the University of Notre Dame and Holy Cross College."""

From left Carlos Castro Stephen Kabele Naomi Shreves and Peter Kabele. (Photo credit: Glenn Rymsza). This fall the Vancouver-Portland branch will open a school in the Kenton area of Portland. The venture named Trinity Academy will begin by offering ninth-grade classes to four children of branch members. ""We are starting out small but we have high hopes for the future” says Vancouver-Portland branch’s principal branch coordinator Charlie Fraga. “We’ve been researching the possibility of a school for years. Finally now seems the time to start."" He adds that the school will fit in well with the branch's other city-building efforts in Kenton. The new school will use a version of the Trinity School curriculum adapted by The Academy Project a company owned and directed by Andrew Zwerneman (northern Virginia) head of school for Trinity School at Meadow View.  Although Trinity Academy in the Vancouver-Portland branch will not be a Trinity School campus at the start branch leaders hope the school will grow toward that goal.  Jo Clark will lead the new Trinity Academy in the fall. Jo Clark a member of the branch with a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Georgetown University will be leaving her position as adjunct professor of chemistry at the University of Portland to become the head of school. The faculty will include various members of the branch each working part-time. Classes will be held in a variety of locations around Kenton explains Eric Shreves whose daughter Naomi will attend the school. “Our hope is that our students will be able to use the basement of the former rectory we own as home base where Jo would teach Humane Letters and walk to Charlie Fraga’s nearby Direct Development office to study Latin with Pat Clark who works there then perhaps meet up with Glenn Rymsza at a portable classroom on the grounds of De La Salle High School located a block away for Scripture or doctrine.” “This decision came after a considerable process of prayer and discernment” says Charlie. ""We received input from branch members from a feasibility study group comprised of some of the branch coordinators and prospective parents and from many people with experience working for Trinity Schools."" “The strength of character of these particular children was a key factor in the decision to move now” adds Jo. “We felt they could handle any difficulties caused by being the inaugural class and would go on to become leaders for newer students.” The inaugural student body consists of four ninth-graders: Carlos Castro Naomi Shreves and twins Peter and Stephen Kabele. After participating in the planning they are all on board with the project. Naomi (15) is excited to get started. “I’m hoping people will see us walking to and from class and recognize our uniforms and know who we are. I’m looking forward to a great education. It also looks like we’ll be able to take part in sports programs at nearby public schools.” Peter Kabele (14) was happy he had a say in how the school was formed and says all his friends “are okay” with the prospect of him attending another school. His brother Stephen is happy he’ll still be eligible to participate in activities such as band or choir at public schools if he chooses to. He even hopes to recruit a few more students before school starts. Carlos Castro (14) says he’ll enjoy walking between classes. Like the others he looks forward to the personal attention he’ll receive because of the school’s small size and appreciates everyone’s efforts to overcome the challenges that come from being so small. “I heard some things about Trinity from friends who live in northern Virginia and they really enjoy it.” “If this experiment works and we do grow larger and strong enough to become a Trinity School campus” Charlie says “it might be a model for how people in other small branches can give their children a Trinity School education. For now please pray that we can discover other students who might be candidates for joining us in this initiative before the school’s opening in September.”"
20161023163829,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5163,July 26 2016 12:17 p.m.,"""I Not Die”: From Sudan to Oregon, a Refugee Carries Her Cross",by Elizabeth Grams Photos: Rob Bolka Lisa Ficker Peter Hermes Furian Glenn Rymsza Shutterstock  Deborah Mayom a survivor of civil war in Sudan and a Trinity Academy parent with her grandson outside her home in Portland. My name Deborah. I love my name. I try to be strong lady like Deborah in Bible. I go five days no food I not die. Too many bullets coming they didn’t hit me. I drink urine I not die. I think my name is very very strong. Deborah Mayom is a mother of eight children a survivor of the long and brutal civil war in the African nation of Sudan an immigrant to the US and most importantly to her a woman of prayer. Last year through circumstances that can only be attributed to the Holy Spirit she became something else something she never expected to be growing up in a war zone—a Trinity Academy parent. Walking out of Little Caesar’s Pizza in North Portland in August 2015 she spotted a sign for Trinity Academy a school sponsored by the Vancouver-Portland branch. She went inside met Jo Clark the head of school and explained that her daughter Nyibol (NEE-ih-bull) was bright and ready for eighth grade. Deborah liked the fact that the school was Christian but she knew she didn’t have enough money to pay for tuition. Jo sensing the Spirit’s prompting told her to come back the next day with Nyibol.  Deborah returned the next day bringing Nyibol and Jo brought her daughter Addie—also 13 and ready for eighth grade. Deborah who has a large gap between her front teeth saw Addie’s braces and said “I like your smile!” Later that day Jo shared what she knew of Deborah’s story with Charlie Fraga who leads the school’s board. Though Trinity Academy had already given out all of the financial aid money in their budget for the year they agreed to admit Nyibol. A few months later a benefactor heard the story and decided to make a donation that more than paid for her tuition.  Deborah and two of her daughters: Nyibol who just completed the eighth grade at Trinity Academy and Abul who will start in sixth grade this fall. Deborah speaks five languages: Dinka Nuer Swahili Arabic and English. Her English is rudimentary but her speech has an unmistakable rhythm and her words are lyrical. Like the psalmists of old she tells of being poor threatened and on the run of facing death while surrounded by enemies on every side of deliverance at the hands of the living God. “I shall not die but live to proclaim what the Lord has done”—these ancient words are as real for her as they were for King David and his men. In telling Deborah’s story I have tried to include many of her own words. As with the Psalms they reveal her soul and the soul of her people.. . .The country of Sudan located in northeast Africa near Egypt and Ethiopia has a history not unlike that of Palestine the homeland of Deborah’s biblical namesake. After centuries of domination by one empire or another including Egypt and Great Britain Sudan achieved independence in 1956 then plunged into civil war. The war pitted the heavily Arab and Muslim northerners who dominated the government against the people of the agricultural and pastoral south where much of the country’s rich oil resources lay. In the south where Deborah grew up the population includes Christians and followers of traditional African religions.  Map: When Deborah fled Sudan she went from Duk (now part of the new country of South Sudan) to the Gambela Region of Ethiopia. Later she came to a refugee camp in Kakuma Kenya the closest thing to a home her children ever had before coming to the US. Deborah was born in 1974 to a Christian family in the village of Duk during a temporary and tenuous peace. Duk is small village. We take care of animals like cow like goat like lamb. We don’t have clothes no shoes. We don’t know what shoes mean! When I’m a child I don’t know nothing. I learn by soil. I learn by animal. I don’t learn by pen—write something down—never! I learn by hand.  I grew up going to church: my father and my mother they brought me. We pray.  In 1983 the government imposed Islamic Sharia law on the entire country including the non-Muslim south. The government ordered the transfer of southern Sudanese soldiers to the north far from their families. The soldiers rebelled and war once again swept through Sudan. In Deborah’s home area government soldiers burned down villages and dropped bombs from the air. Deborah told me that her father was killed by gunfire from a helicopter during a raid. Later when her village was attacked she became separated from her mother and the rest of her family. Muslim people shoot my church. Those people kill my dad immediately. They take our house. And then we run away. I separate from my mom. They shoot at us and then we run away. Tomorrow another place. Tomorrow another place. Walk walk walk.  Not knowing whether her mother brother and sister were still alive Deborah headed east along with many other refugees hiding alone or with small groups in the bushes to avoid getting caught by the soldiers. She trekked through river wetlands and across deserts eventually reaching Ethiopia. There she took up residence with thousands of other Sudanese in a camp with minimal shelter poor sanitation and barely enough food for survival. Cholera and other diseases were rampant.  A typical Dinka village in South Sudan similiar to the one Deborah lived in as a child. While in Ethiopia she met a soldier with the Sudan People’s Liberation Army which had formed after the imposition of Sharia in 1983 and had established training camps in Ethiopia. She married him in 1990. Deborah was 16—a normal age for a woman to marry in Sudan. A year later the Ethiopian government was taken over by a new party which was friendly to the government of Sudan. The new Ethiopian regime expelled the Sudanese refugees and soldiers from the camps. At the Gilo River while a group of refugees waited to be ferried across Ethiopian soldiers trained their fire on the crowd many of them children. Ethiopia people they shooting us. Yes they shooting us! We die. We go to river they shoot at us in the river. They shoot us they shoot us. In river there is too much water but we don’t know swim. And then people go in the water and then drown.  John Bul Dau an eyewitness said in a memoir Lost Boy Lost Girl that hundreds died while trying to cross the Gilo from bullets crocodiles or drowning. But Deborah carrying her oldest daughter had made it over on a ferry before the shooting started. She reentered Sudan where the war raged on. For many months she travelled in and out of southern Sudan moving on when fighting or air raids came close walking sometimes for months at a time in and through a broad border region that includes parts of Uganda Ethiopia and Kenya. Sometimes she ate food from trash heaps. In 1992 Deborah came to Kakuma a United Nations camp in northern Kenya which hosted tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees. Though she continued to make journeys to visit her husband who was still fighting in southern Sudan she and her growing number of children were based in Kakuma for almost 18 years. For the Mayom family and most inhabitants of the camp in the ’90s and early 2000s food clothing medical provisions and jobs were scarce. The refugees were not allowed to seek employment outside of the camp. Deborah used to bake little donuts that she would sell to other refugees using the profits to buy clothes for her children. Nyibol remembers going to school learning to read and write primarily in Swahili rather than in her native Dinka language.  Deborah and her children spent almost 18 years at Kakuma a United Nations refugee camp in Kenya. While at Kakuma one of Deborah’s children died suddenly from a mysterious illness. My son David he got fever and then after two day no energy. My son die. He’s a big boy 13 years. After that I pray. I pray God to make me come to America.  By 2005 much of the war in Sudan had ended and a peace process had begun which ultimately led to the creation of the new independent country of South Sudan. But the prospect of returning to Sudan from Kenya did not look good for Deborah and her children. There was still scattered fighting in the south primarily among tribes who had been stripped of much of the cattle and farmlands they had depended on for their livelihoods. Also Deborah’s husband had taken several other wives by this time (a common practice in South Sudan) and she says he did not provide financial support for her and her children. She petitioned the US government for asylum. While she waited her brother James came to see her. He had left Sudan at age seven one of thousands known as “lost boys” too young to fight but old enough to run. Like Deborah he had made his way to Ethiopia but had already been given asylum by the US in the early 2000s. He had been trained as an X-ray technician and in 2005 had returned to Sudan to help rebuild the south. James tracked down his sister and went to see her at Kakuma their first visit since the mid-1980s. He told her he’d been to Duk where there was nothing left. “You can’t even find the foundation of the houses. The war burnt down everything.” In 2010 after four years of waiting the US granted Deborah’s petition for asylum. She flew to a new world in Portland with her seven children. When they arrived none of them knew the language. Catholic Charities gave them a few months of financial support and an orientation. Sue Edwards a veteran volunteer with World Relief Services who befriended Deborah in Portland spoke about the challenges refugees like the Mayoms face: “They usually have a day or two to get ready then hop onto a plane. The government of their new country connects them with an organization like Catholic Charities or World Relief or Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service which takes care of them for about a week. They set them up in an apartment for three months and then they’re kind of on their own. The kids often get bullied—other kids don’t understand why they are so dark and don’t speak the language.” I got here. It’s a good place. And in the morning I’m looking at my window. I saw church. I say yes. I’m going now. My kids say you don’t know English! I say not about language. We go to pray. And then we go to church. And that pastor welcome us.  Nyibol remembers being surprised at how similar Portland seemed to Nairobi Kenya where she’d been before. “I was confused—I thought it would be different. People in Africa thought that robots do everything for you in the US. We thought we weren’t going to need our clothes because every day we’d wake up and find something new that the robots made for us.” Deborah had to learn how to lock a door drive a car use a shower and a refrigerator. Members of Glenfair Evangelical Church who had first welcomed her and where she became a member helped her with laundry and childcare in those first few months. Sue helped her learn how to drive and showed her how to cook a turkey but Deborah is still leery of the oven. Six years after coming to the US Deborah is more settled but her life is not easy. She works all afternoon and half the night in a low-paying job packaging food and cleaning at a bakery regularly sending money back to relatives in Africa including her mother whom Deborah had learned was still alive. After only a few hours’ sleep she gets her children ready and out the door for school. Before Deborah heads to work she studies and goes to a local community college to continue learning English. She spends much of her day off cooking food for the family to last the week. I’m working now. It’s a good job. Because before I pray I say God give me a good place. Because I love communicate. I love people. When some people look us maybe they say I look like someone not take shower. We strangers you know. When we come here and someone do that I’m not sad because they don’t know how to do. Right now I been for four years in that place; they know Deborah is a human being.  Nyibol has taken quickly to life at Trinity Academy. Perhaps unsurprisingly she is an especially quick study in Latin her sixth language. She played on the school’s first junior high basketball team. Pat and Jo Clark often drive her home from school since she lives near their home and Deborah works a late shift at her bakery job. Deborah often visits the school early in the day bringing huge bags of day-old bread and pastries from the bakery delivering them to students and faculty. She has registered her 11-year-old daughter Abul to enter Trinity Academy’s sixth grade in the fall of 2016.  Nyibol who first learned to read and write in Swahili enjoys learning with fellow Trinity Academy eighth graders (from left) Addie Ava and Agapena. “Nyibol is really bright and hardworking” says Jo. “Students were learning calligraphy in their art class and taking Latin at the beginning of the year. Nyibol loves both of those things. At one point she wrote a poem and she went to her Latin teacher and asked if she would help her translate it into Latin. Then she wrote it out in calligraphy and came to show me and her art teacher.” Nyibol she love Trinity. She love teachers she love students. Trinity is very very very good to Nyibol. Me too I love Trinity. They pray first and then they go to class. I love that. Dr. Clark is very very good lady. She put her life to Bible. God first and things second. Dr. Clark works for God. She don’t work for things. Dr. Clark comes to clean all the tables after the students are gone. She have a good family.  Jo Clark with Deborah. Deborah lives with five of her children in a simple Portland townhouse. (Two of the children have grown and moved out.) A clay cross decorated with beads and purple paint hangs over their door. Her neat sitting room has a display of family photos from Africa and plaques bearing Christian poems and old-fashioned pictures of Jesus. Lower on the wall hangs the handwritten poem Nyibol wrote at Trinity. Each seat on the sofas is covered with doilies Deborah embroidered with flowers. A framed photo of Deborah’s husband dressed in army fatigues stands in a prominent spot on the credenza. She talks to me about prayer: To my kid I say to pray to ask God everything. You don’t have nothing? Ask God to give to you. God there is big hand. God there is big eye. God there is big ear. Before my father and my mom told me don’t forget to pray. I didn’t forget to pray up to now. Because God hearing good. God looking good. God listening good.  At one point she pulled down the purple cross from above the doorway and held it in her hand showing how she would carry it high in front of her in Africa when she walked through the bush or when she prayed at church. Because we don’t we don’t forgot a cross. Because we die about a cross. We die forever about that cross. That song . . . It say we die about Jesus. They say you die Jesus about us. You go to cross about us.  She showed me how she kneels in front of a statue of Joseph and Mary and Jesus in the manger every day in the morning to pray. She kissed them all several times with affection and reverence. Here was another poor family who had to run for their lives into a foreign land. Here was another mother who lost a child. Here was another child in whom the parents placed their hope for a greater future. I’m poor. But I’m not thinking about it. I have food today because God change life. Right now I thank God. Because God working at night working in the morning every day. I know Jesus live with me. Lives with everybody. I go to backyard he’s there. I walking in the street he’s there. Everywhere.
20161023215641,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5365,Sept. 21 2016 10:34 a.m.,The Dusty Palace: Building Lives and Furniture in Grand Rapids and Beyond,Coleman Moore and Mark Petersen look at wood samples in the showroom of The Custom Cottage furniture shop in Grand Rapids Michigan. by Sean Connolly Photos: Margaret Anderson Sean Connolly and Courtesy of the Custom Cottage The Custom Cottage is a furniture shop in Grand Rapids Michigan located in the back of a red brick factory that covers a city block. The factory’s tall Italianate tower hovers over the surrounding neighborhood like a church steeple. Inside a thick yellow-green dust has settled everywhere—on the saws stacks of boards and worktables on bunk beds queen beds bookshelves and dining tables on a black leather Bible that rests on a small table near the entry even on the shop’s founder Coleman Moore. He is a shorter man of 60 in jeans a faded work shirt and a pair of aquamarine glasses that bring out the bright blue-green color of his eyes. With two pencils poking out from his pocket he looks the part of a lifelong furniture builder. But he was many other things—a real estate developer a student at nearby Calvin Seminary a pastor and a church planter—before he built his first piece of furniture. Even then he had no idea that a one-off project for his wife would become a business or that he would employ ex-cons alcoholics drug addicts homeless men and returned soldiers training them to become craftsmen. Like Coleman this place took me by surprise. When I first came into his shop my mission was simple enough: to plan the construction of a dining room table for my growing family in South Bend. I had no idea that God might want to open a similar furniture shop in Evansville a place where our neighbors might one day come to find that most precious of modern human necessities—a job.  * * *Coleman Moore grew up in the mountains of east Tennessee. His father was an executive who traveled often so busy with work that as Coleman recalled he only came to one of his son’s baseball games. “If I was going to spend any time with him the only opportunity was to do what he was doing” Coleman said. That meant working alongside him in the basement wood shop where father and son built shelves for the house and a pergola for the backyard. The son took to the work making his own Soap Box Derby car and a pontoon boat from Styrofoam and cedar. None of this seemed relevant to Coleman’s career path. After college he became an executive with a real estate development company. He managed a development in downtown Dallas with three office buildings and a 12-story hotel with an ice skating rink in the atrium. By the world’s standards he and his wife Mary were doing fine with three children a house and a cottage on the Gulf of Mexico. They were churchgoers but largely for their children’s sake. Then one Lent Coleman decided to read the Bible straight through. It took him 18 months but when he got to the end he told Mary that the Bible had “an absolutely radical message.” He said that they should either start living by it or quit pretending to be Christians. They chose the former and eventually God called them to move to Grand Rapids where Coleman enrolled in Calvin Seminary and began studying to be a pastor. To pay the bills Mary began working full-time on a night shift as a labor and delivery nurse giving up the time with her children that she had treasured in her former part-time job. “That was a very very difficult switch for me” she said. Times were tough for the Moores. “The family went to negative cash flow” Coleman said.  After graduation they moved to North Carolina where Coleman started an interracial church called The River. It was there that he also learned about the charismatic movement. At a charismatic conference Coleman heard an invitation to come up for prayer to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. He waited until the last moment then went forward falling to the floor after hands were laid on his head. For 20 minutes he had “an amazing conversation with God.” When he got up he had decided he would not speak for one week. In that silence he began to learn to recognize God’s voice how to distinguish it from the clutter and noise on one hand and the snarling whispers of the enemy on the other. “I wasn’t the same” he said of the experience. The Moores returned to Michigan in 2005 so Coleman could become the pastor of another Reformed church near Grand Rapids. He worked there for five years until it became clear to him that his charismatic spirituality and the church’s more traditional approach would not meld. He was in his mid-50s and unemployed or as he puts it “waiting on my next call.” He figured that a new call would come from a church and began searching for Reformed congregations of a more charismatic bent but no calls came. Then one day in 2012 Mary asked Coleman if he would build a headboard for their bed since she couldn’t find the kind she wanted anywhere. “I’d been looking on Craigslist because we didn’t have a lot of money trying to find a headboard in the shabby-chic style” she said.  Dan Romero is building a 10-foot-long dining room table. Each piece at The Custom Cottage is built to specifications set by the customer. Coleman finished the headboard and posted a picture on Craigslist figuring that if Mary wanted one perhaps others would too. A few orders came in and he began filling them in his garage. The fledgling company soon graduated to a four-car garage then to a 3000-square-foot space in Rockford a Grand Rapids suburb. The orders kept rolling in: for beds for nightstands desks and entertainment centers– so many orders that he hired seven people. The business was growing but Coleman saw it as little more than a stopover. “I’m still thinking Okay Lord when is that church going to open up that you want me to pastor?” That perspective changed on a Sunday in April 2013. Ryan Walkes a guest speaker at his church described the Bridge Street House of Prayer the inner-city ministry he had founded in Grand Rapids. Walkes made a passing comment about how the people they were meeting needed jobs. For Coleman it was a revelation. He saw the purpose of his life laid out before him—to provide jobs for people in the inner city. “The Spirit moved and moved my heart” he said. Walking out of church that day Coleman was asking the Lord what he should do next when God spoke to him in no uncertain terms: Do nothing for two weeks. For a man of action it was a hard message. “I’m not good at waiting” Coleman said. But he waited anyway. Two weeks later early on a Sunday morning he woke up suddenly. God began to speak to him again: Get up now. I am going to give you a vision. Write this down.  “I had a real vision” he explained “to move to the city of Grand Rapids close to where people who were struggling to find jobs would live near a bus route.” God told him that he would provide the space that he would provide the people and that Coleman shouldn’t worry about either. He gave Coleman a phrase which summed up his mission: “Building lives through building furniture.” Coleman began to tell his employees and friends that he would be moving the business to inner-city Grand Rapids. “Everybody I was working with thought I was crazy.” Then on a Sunday morning in June 2013 he woke up and heard God speak to him once more. He had the sense that he should drive to a building he had seen on the Internet an old factory. There he saw a sign advertising space for lease. He called the number and arranged a tour. “It had no door only a fire escape entrance. No docks” Coleman recalled but the price was “unbelievably low.” He signed a lease and The Custom Cottage opened in the old factory in August 2013. His first two employees at the new location came from the Bridge Street House of Prayer ministry.* * *I first heard about The Custom Cottage in the fall of 2013. Their Craigslist ads showed pictures of dining room tables made from old barnwood their long planks revealing the curved swirl marks of ancient steam-driven circular saws. A few weeks later I had to go to Grand Rapids for a conference and managed to stop by the shop. I met Coleman then realized it would be worth returning with my wife Gretchen. When we came back in January we both were excited about building a table but reality set in as we realized we would need to save up the money. It took two years of stashing money from Christmas checks and selling less important possessions but by Christmas 2015 we had met our goal. On a snowy Martin Luther King Day we brought our whole family to the shop to place our order. We were met by Ross Graveling Coleman’s right-hand man. Ross helped us finalize our plans for a table that would be seven feet long by 44 inches wide with two leaves that would take it out to nine feet. It would be made from long maple planks with knots and striations of dark color.  The Custom Cottage showroom in the front of the shop includes beds and tables in a variety of styles. Seven weeks later I returned with Jeremy Osterhouse to carry our table home. As we dusted it off and removed the top for transport Coleman told us more about his approach to the business. The mission of “Building lives through building furniture” shapes many of the practical details of how the business operates leading Coleman to some interesting innovations. One is complete flexibility of scheduling. Each builder has a set of keys and can work any time he wants 24-7. “If they need to be home to take care of the kids if they need to go along on a field trip or be there for a sporting event or a play that’s fine. I encourage that” Coleman said. This means that Coleman never has to hassle or punish a worker who’s late if a car breaks down or if he needs to leave to see his parole officer. Another innovation has to do with pay structure. He pays each of the builders minimum wage—$8.50 an hour in Michigan—and then pays them by the piece on top of that. He said a trained builder should be able to make between $15 and $20 per hour. Some of the workers do earn that much and those who don’t are offered further training.  Elijah Mosley works on a table.  Chris Conley works in the paint room where he paints polyurethanes and stains furniture. He also set up the business so that he rarely will have cause to fire someone. Coleman said there are only two reasons he would consider letting someone go. First if a builder after getting trained demonstrates no aptitude for furniture making. Second if he simply never shows up holding a place that could go to someone else. This means that no one will be fired for drinking on the job cussing out the boss messing up orders or getting tossed in jail for a couple of nights. “I can handle getting cussed out” Coleman said. The shop employs 10 people and Coleman said turnover is very low. Business comes in with help from Craigslist Facebook and word of mouth but Coleman said that God ultimately runs their marketing department and Coleman relies on God to bring in enough orders to keep everyone busy. “There have been times when we’ve had lots of orders to fill” he said. There have been slow times too but “we’ve never had a time when there has not been at least one order on the desk to fill.” Impressed I told others in the community about Coleman and the shop including Nick Holovaty who is responsible for the Mission program office and my boss Paul DeCelles who has overall responsibility for our mission work. We had been talking about how we could employ our neighbors in our mission locations and we wondered whether Coleman’s model might work. Paul suggested I return to the shop and write this story.* * *I returned in March hoping to meet some of the builders and learn about their experience. I arrived in time for lunch which the builders eat together each day. They share stories from their lives in an atmosphere of brotherhood that reminded me of a men’s group. A time of prayer follows lunch with one of the workers reading a Bible passage and a short reflection.  Each day at the shop the workers gather for lunch and a time of prayer swapping stories and praying for one another’s needs. Elijah Mosley is a 37-year-old African American a husband and father of seven children. He’s the most experienced builder and the natural leader on the shop floor. He said he’s built every kind of piece the shop produces and he has a fierce pride in his work borne out in the pictures he takes and posts to Facebook. “To build something you have to see it in your head” he told me. “It’s like a big puzzle. That’s the whole joy of what I do. You are able to take something and make it your own. It’s a craft.” He told me the story of a woman who saved her money for 15 months to buy a bedroom set then came in and paid for the whole thing in cash rather than putting down a deposit like everybody else. Eli saw the joy she had when she finally received her furniture and would not forget it. Eli also had a warning for me. He wanted me to know that not all the employees had troubled pasts and even those who did should not be seen in light of those pasts. They are builders now and the mission of the shop belongs not just to Coleman but to them. “I feel it’s us the workers that keep the company driving keep Coleman on his toes” he said.  Eli Mosley’s workstation features a sign made by one of his seven children. Another builder Mark Petersen 59 is clean-shaven in jeans and a gray t-shirt. Like Eli he also posts pictures of his work to Facebook and he talked proudly of a barnwood table with a trestle base painted light green that is featured in The Custom Cottage ads. When I met him Mark had been working at the shop for a little more than a year. He said that two years earlier he’d spent time in jail on a drunk driving charge. He’d been out of jail for only a month when he learned that he had stage three cancer in his neck. After chemotherapy and radiation treatments it took him more than a year to recover then he went to work at The Custom Cottage. “I live by myself” he said. “I don’t have a family and because of my past my finan - cial situation isn’t the greatest so it’s nice to be able to make extra money when I need to. It also keeps me out of trouble. You live by yourself you get bored at home you get tired and a lot of times it’s like man I need to get out of here I need to go do something and you end up doing something you might regret go to the bar but instead you just go to your job make some money and keep yourself out of trouble. It’s been a very good plan for me. “I’m still on parole right now. I’ve got about six months left. There’s just no way I want to take any chances. Getting into the system is extremely easy. Getting out is extremely hard.”* * *Two weeks later I was back in the shop. I had asked Coleman if he would take me through the same training he gives the other builders. I brought along Rus Lyons one of our missionaries who wanted to see if something like this shop might work in Evansville. Coleman said we would begin like all the builders do by making a bed. He got us started by sketching a plan for the bed a job the builder himself would normally do. (Planning is one of the hardest skills to master and Coleman wants each builder to learn how to do it.) Next he explained the shop’s system of building which involves putting wood together in layers. By the end of the first day with Coleman standing close by to answer questions I had finished putting together the headboard while Rus had begun working on a set of storage cubbies that would slide under the bed. The next day I built the end rail and began the long slow process of sanding everything.  Rus Lyons at his work table where he was building a king-sized bed. While working on the end rail I made my first big mistake. I was using a power hand planer to smooth the top of a leg so the three layers would be flush. The planer hit a ridge and kicked back sending a crack through one of the leg boards. I thought I had ruined it but Coleman said we would glue it. He told me that a lot of builders expect to be punished when they make mistakes and they’re surprised when they aren’t. Coleman sees this in light of the gospel. “How many chances does Jesus give us? Two three four in essence an infinite number of chances. So how many chances are we going to give each other?” When the bed was finally ready to assemble Mark came by and gave it a shake. It had quite a wobble and my heart wobbled along with it. I figured a legion of rookie mistakes had added up creating a permanent instability. But the story wasn’t over. It turned out we hadn’t secured the brackets properly. Once they were locked down we shook the bed again and it hardly moved. Mark gave me a fist bump.  Sean Connolly and Rus Lyons built this bed together out of maple and barnwood while Sean was working on this story and Rus was discerning whether to pursue an apprenticeship at the shop. The thrill of building is hard to describe. It felt like a runner’s high and stayed with me for some time. I could only imagine how good it would feel to someone who had spent years in prison or living on the streets–a thrill that no drug or crime could induce and that no Boss or Government Agent could ever take away. Before Rus and I headed home after our training Coleman said “I tell you what you guys sure qualified to be builders.” We would have made the cut and that only added to the thrill. We were pumped! For Rus passing this training meant more. After praying and talking with Nick Paul and the other missionaries he accepted an offer from Coleman to apprentice at the shop. In May he moved to Grand Rapids for six months to a year. Coleman will teach Rus every aspect of the business: building the pieces painting and staining them fixing mistakes marketing and advertising sales accounting etc. Rus’s intention is to open a furniture shop in Evansville on The Custom Cottage model and Coleman has agreed to help him get it started.   Two photos of a trestle table built by Mark Petersen a design that has been popular with customers. Coleman told me that talking with Rus has expanded his vision. He very much likes the idea that a furniture shop in Evansville would not only be transforming individual lives but be part of “something bigger that God is doing”—the transformation of an entire neighborhood and community. In one of our later conversations I asked Coleman about the name of the business. He told me it was inspired by a parable in C.S. Lewis’s Mere Christianity: “Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first perhaps you understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. “What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building a quite different house than the one you thought of—throwing out a new wing here putting on an extra floor there running up towers making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself.” The parable is a fitting metaphor for Coleman’s life–a real estate developer turned pastor who fully expected to build a church of a certain predictable type. But it turned out God wanted to build something else a dusty palace a place where each day he would go to work alongside his friends Coleman Eli Mark and the others building lives and building furniture. The building continues. Rus said “When I was driving from Evansville up to Grand Rapids for one of my first visits I saw one of my neighbors who right now is homeless has a son and spends more time with his son than quite a number of folks who have houses and jobs. I was filled with this searing love that the Father has for him and overcome with this desire to help him provide for himself so that he could provide for his son. And I knew one hundred percent that the Lord was calling me to start a business where he could do that.”
20170303213644,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5470,Oct. 18 2016 11:24 a.m.,Stories from Urban Farming - Evansville,"Peter Putzier sent us this story about the Urban Farm in Evansville: God continues to bless our efforts to expand the Urban Farm (Praise Harvest) in Evansville. A couple of weeks ago there was a word at the local community meeting which I remember as ""multiply your efforts"". The word stuck with me and I began looking for ways to respond. In the following two weeks I experienced several instances of God sending people to me who multiplied my efforts!   We are covering the space between our raised bed gardens with mulch that was dropped off for free after we sent a request in to the city arborist. The mulch was dumped in an empty space across the street from our garden plot to allow trucks room for maneuvering. This left us with A LOT of mulch to move across the street. One day I was out moving mulch and a man arrived at a nearby empty lot on a tractor. He spent about 30 minutes mowing the empty lot and when he finished he drove over and said ""You're making me feel guilty watching you work so hard. Would you like some help!"" The man who was a volunteer mower for the non-profit land owner proceeded to move mulch with me for an hour with the front end loader on his tractor. He moved half of the mulch. God was looking out for us by sending support through this generous man!  A second story: We have a neighbor in his late sixties who often stops to chat on the way to the bus stop. The man (who is always wearing a wide brimmed straw hat) has experience in small engine repair. Once when he stopped by to talk and I asked ""When are you going to help me fix our rototiller?"" He said ""Just let me know when you're working on it."" The following Saturday he and I worked on our broken rototiller (one tool in our fleet of cheap or donated tools that don't function at 100%!). Among other things he adjusted the distance between the magnet and fly wheel with a folded dollar bill. Within 45 minutes ""we"" had the tiller running! Praise God for multiplying our efforts through the help of our neighbors."
20170304025218,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5463,Oct. 5 2016 11:42 a.m.,South Bend Girls Discover Honey Making,Some of the girls from the South Bend branch went on a field trip to learn about beekeeping October 2nd. Thanks to Mary Lee who sent in this piece about it: On a sunny but chilly Saturday morning this Fall 12 girls aged 7 to11 and their leaders from the South Bend branch carpooled to Ken and Pam Peterson’s home where they were warmly greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Peterson and their dog Bailey. The girls were ushered into a fragrant and somewhat stuffy room off the Petersons’ kitchen where they crowded around a table laden with close to a hundred pounds of honey in jars of every shape and size. The only uniform thing about the jars was their amber color and the round white label bearing the name Church Yard Farms affixed to each lid. The jars of translucent honey seemed to glow as they captured the light that was flooding in through a nearby window.  Reverend Peterson a saintly looking retired Lutheran pastor had sort of stumbled upon the hobby of beekeeping after retirement when his son’s neighbor casually mentioned that his trees had never been so fruitful as when another neighbor was keeping bees. Of course (Mr. Peterson had an epiphany)! Fruit is produced when birds bees and to a lesser extent the wind carry pollen from one flower to another. So one reasons the more bees you have around the more fruit you will get! Thus began a journey of discovery that has evolved into a small time beekeeping operation with 16 hives scattered over 7 locations around the Michiana area.  The girls who were there to learn about beekeeping were enrapt as Mr. Peterson explained in great detail the life of a hive: what the three main types of bees are who work together to maintain the hive how they build honeycomb how they raise offspring how they forage for pollen and how they store up food for the winter (which we benefit from). They were alternately terrified and amazed when he dressed in full white protective garb opened a hive and pulled out a tray of honeycomb that was covered in massive clumps of bees busily going about the business of making honey. Back inside his house they clustered (like bees) around Mr. Peterson as he carefully sliced the outer layer of wax off of a honeycomb squealing in delight as the honey began to ooze out and chanting counted the number of cranks of the handle it took him to extract the honey using his beekeeper’s centrifuge.  As I watched the girls and felt their excitement I was moved almost to tears but I was not immediately aware of why. Was it that this is the kind of thing I tend to care about: people like Ken acquiring important basic skills and knowledge that humans have relied on for millennia (but that have been nearly lost in the modern world) and exposing kids to that knowledge and those skills? My instincts told me there was something deeper going on. After a lot of thought and reflection I realized that as I experienced Ken’s delight in his bees and watched the girls entering into his delight I was witnessing the Lord delighting in and caring for his creation through Ken. And the thought came to me this is a holy occupation.

Appleton Cincinnati Colorado Springs Dominica Grenada Kingston Memphis Rockford Yakima . . . the Sklorenkos have been to them all visiting prayer groups and branches. (They’ve been to all 21 locations where the community currently has branches). In June of 2016 after more than 35 years of travel and service the Sklorenkos made their last official branch visit to Buffalo. David formally retired from his role as Mission coordinator on July 1 a few months shy of his 80th birthday. But before all of those trips in the 1970s the Sklorenkos were living in Hawaii where David had founded or run a number of businesses involving road construction landscaping property development and warehousing. They had four children. They were founding members of a Catholic parish and were active in a charismatic prayer group. . . . They were an active couple. Clem and Julie Walters recall meeting them in 1978 when members of the prayer group in Hawaii took them unannounced to the Sklorenkos’ home. “There were David and Sharon and all the children from the oldest to the youngest working on a very dirty project moving stones” Clem said. “I thought to myself that guy can really do something—he can organize kids!” Julie recalls how Sharon immediately dropped what she was doing to welcome her guests to an impromptu meal and visit in their home. After the Sklorenkos attended the charismatic Kansas City conference in 1977 David felt a tug from the Lord to join covenant community on the mainland. The Sklorenko family moved from Hawaii to South Bend in 1979 leaving behind businesses family members and friends as well as the prayer group (which went on to became the Oahu branch of the People of Praise). “It was a leap of faith” says Sharon. “It seemed like a lot to leave everything but the minute I got to South Bend it just seemed right. I never looked back.” In South Bend David’s business expertise was put to use for the community right away. He took on management of the LaSalle Building managed the community’s bookstore and restaurant there and worked in the conference office of Charismatic Renewal Services (CRS) which was administering national charismatic conferences hosting thousands of people. Sharon worked in the building too first helping out in the restaurant then joining David in the conference office.  In February of 1997 the Sklorenkos were visiting the Kingston branch when couples from Appleton Rockford and South Bend visiting the island for vacations met up with them at a park. In 1980 they began visiting prayer groups and fledgling communities sprouting out of the charismatic renewal to train them in what the People of Praise had learned about community life. That work became part of the Christians in Mission program office after it was founded in 1981 and Overall Coordinator Paul DeCelles later appointed David to be a Mission coordinator. In the following years the Sklorenkos helped several of those groups through the process of becoming branches of the People of Praise. Over time their work naturally shifted from relating to prayer groups to relating to branches. David became the coordinator responsible for the branches in Appleton Grenada Kingston Rockford and Yakima. Sharon took on a handmaid-like role which Dawn Keaveny (Kingston) described: “She was always concerned about every woman in the branch and on every visit inquired how each was doing. She loved our children and they loved her in return earning her the title ‘Aunty Sharon.’ She shared practical advice about family marriage sisterhood and generally what it means to be a godly woman.” They did all this while David served as a coordinator in the South Bend branch and Sharon both served as a handmaid and worked at CRS assisting Vice-President Pat Rath. At the same time they were raising their children and opening their home to household members to David’s aunt and Sharon’s mother. David was also administering conferences across the US and he was intimately involved in several key property deals: securing the community centers in Rockford and Appleton buying the community’s first properties in Allendale and overseeing construction at the LaSalle Company’s new warehouse and office. The Sklorenkos were so often on the road that David eventually became a member of the American Airlines Two Million Miler program. They were known for their undaunted cheerfulness. Maureen McDonough (South Bend) whose friendship with Sharon goes back to the days they waitressed in the Lasalle Restaurant together notes that she never heard Sharon complain. “She never loved to travel but she was always ready to go in an instant when the Lord said ‘Go’” Maureen said. In September of 1988 Hurricane Gilbert swept through Jamaica destroying buildings and cutting off supplies. After the storm David and Sharon took the first flight they could get into the country to support the brothers and sisters in the recently established Kingston branch. In New York’s Kennedy Airport they discovered that the crates of canned goods they brought along wouldn’t be allowed on the plane so they bought a bunch of duffle bags and hurriedly repacked the food in those. “In the midst of our difficulties God sent Dave and Sharon from South Bend to encourage us” wrote Andre Johnstone in a 1989 Vine & Branches article. “They stayed with us for one week and experienced with us the difficulties of having no water no electricity no bread.” “David and Sharon represented and exhibited the spirit and the lived experience of the covenant that we had committed to” said Dominic Jeremiah the head of the branch leaders’ team in Grenada. “When they visited they would literally put down their bags from a long and exhausting flight and start assisting with laundry or folding clothes or choosing to go visit a brother or sister who needed to chat with them. David’s skillful diplomacy also opened many doors with leaders of the local church and established our community as a positive presence.”  In the fall of 1990 David and Sharon Sklorenko visited the branch in Grenada. Included in the photo are Jim and Beth Bulger (Servant Branch) and John and Amy Zwerneman (South Bend) who are continuing the Sklorenkos’ work in branch relations as well as Sheila Loughran (South Bend) and Edwardlina Sylvester (Grenada). Mike Madden (Appleton) points out that despite the breadth of David and Sharon’s relationships “You always feel like you are the only one in the room when they listen to you.” Jennifer Ambrose (Rockford) says “When Stu’s father died they pitched in and helped empty and clean up the house. They’ve been to our kids’ baptisms; we’ve been to one another’s parents’ funerals. They’ve had our backs administering a hug or a slap–whichever was necessary. And they know how to laugh.” The Sklorenkos have passed the baton to others. Jim and Beth Bulger (Servant Branch) began relating to the branches in Kingston and Grenada in 2014 and John and Amy Zwerneman (South Bend) began relating to the Appleton and Rockford branches in July 2016. Kevin Ranaghan started working with the Sklorenkos in 1996 and has continued to do so ever since then in his capacity as the head of the community’s branch relations team. “The branch relations team and many of our branches will sorely miss David and Sharon” he said. “They brought teaching understanding of the wider community and real-life wisdom into each branch. In a genuinely heartfelt way they have been friends to all forging bonds of love and care that will outlast their many years of service.” David and Sharon are celebrating their retirement in a way that should not be surprising: by packing their bags for a trip to Alaska.

Hurricane Matthew passed by us without causing any damage at all. We had three rain showers last night and it was heavily overcast but already we are back to normal. “It is nothing like we expected. We thought there was nothing we could do to avoid it. We did our best to prepare then sat back to wait. The country basically shut down. There was an unusual calmness in the air. We thought it was the calm before a storm but then we didn't get the usual winds that typically precede a storm. There was a little flooding in one section of Kingston but nothing affected branch members praise God. “We did not have to cancel any meetings–we don't have meetings on the first Sunday of the month any way. A lot of people prayed. A lot of concerns were shared. We followed the commonly followed recommendations: water and flashlight batteries stored and storm lamps.""

She is a member of the Sisterhood. We moved onto the corner of Linwood and Madison in Evansville on Good Friday 2012. Right onto the toughest corner of one of the toughest neighborhoods in town. One of our neighbors told us “You’re moving right into the heart of the hood.” I knew that the Lord had given us those houses and given us that strategic location but I didn’t realize that he was also going to give me opportunities to experience what life is really like for our neighbors there. I grew up on a farm near Vincennes Indiana. Our large family always had enough money and more than enough friends. From there I went to college in South Bend joined the People of Praise and shortly thereafter became part of the Sisterhood. Because of my education and background I knew how to speak and behave in such a way that I would be treated with respect. And I always had been.   The intersection of Linwood and Madison in Evansville was once referred to as “Devil’s Corner” because it was the site of so many fights and drug deals. Soon after our household of sisters moved onto the corner we started getting sick. We’d been cleaning our rental house for days but we couldn’t get rid of the stench. Was it old urine? Mold? Or worse had someone been making meth there? We didn’t know. We just knew that we’d been using gallons of bleach but the odor in the house was so strong you couldn’t even smell any bleach. We spent two weeks in South Bend while the missionary brothers worked on fixing the problem for us. New cabinets and countertops ductwork cleaned a new ceiling black mold removed and a repaired furnace later the problem was fixed. It turned out that thousands upon thousands of cockroach carcasses (thankfully long dead) were responsible for that sickening smell. That was a first taste of what it’s like but unlike our neighbors we had the manpower and means to fix it. Once the smell was gone I was so eager to be in the neighborhood. I slept like a baby that first night but within a week I started waking up in the middle of the night anxious and afraid. I didn’t know why. I thought it was the enemy so after our neighborhood women’s group one night I asked for prayers. During the prayer Netesha got a word from the Lord: “God wants you to know what it’s like for women in this neighborhood only they don’t know how to fight.” When she said that I remembered hearing neighbors talk about what sounded to me like paranoia at night. Netesha was right they didn’t know how to fight how to pray against the devil. God had given me another taste of what our neighbors’ life is like but unlike them I had the means to fight. After the prayer I went back to sleeping soundly. A year or two later on a warm summer afternoon I went to visit Mary who lives a few houses down from us. I had been talking with Carrie Johnson when I realized I was supposed to meet Mary at one o’clock. She didn’t answer the door so I started jogging back to Carrie’s house. While I was running a shiny white SUV pulled up next to me. The driver was wearing a White Sox cap and jersey. He yelled at me “Hey come over here! It’s the police!” I thought no way! All I could think of were stories I had heard of men impersonating police officers and abducting women so I kept going. He kept yelling at me and finally he flashed a set of police lights and blared the siren for a second. So I stopped. I still didn’t know what was going on but I was cornered. He got out of the car and flashed a badge. Again I thought of the stories I had heard: don’t believe a flashed badge. Right away a shiny black sports car pulled up as well and that guy got out too. The first guy yelled at me “I told you we’re US marshals! When I say stop you stop!” I wish I’d had the presence of mind to say to them “Do you know what neighborhood you’re in accosting a woman like this?” But it all happened so quickly I couldn’t think straight. Two of the missionary brothers Evan Lent and Joe Cassell had seen the whole thing from their house and they tried to approach me to help out but the second marshal kept them back. They couldn’t get closer to me than 30 feet. I was totally alone and I was so confused. What was going on? Why were they stopping me? What had I done wrong? Why was he yelling at me? The first marshal started grilling me and he was very aggressive. I was so intimidated. “Why were you running? What’s your name? Who were you visiting? What were you doing there?” I told him I was a Christian missionary and I was going to see Mary on a mission visit. He said “How do you know her? Do you know that she’s wanted?” I knew she was on probation but I didn’t know she was wanted. My heart sank at the thought that this woman who had been working on turning her life around might have committed another crime. He kept questioning me. I felt totally powerless. I couldn’t get anywhere or talk to anyone. They could have easily taken me away. I’d never been so intimidated accused disrespected and completely unable to defend myself. The angry questioning went on for a while and finally the marshals decided that my story was legitimate and I couldn’t help them find Mary so they both left. I was surprised by how shaken and confused I was by the experience. I still didn’t know what had happened or why it had happened to me.  The house the missionary men live in which houses the main kitchen dining room and meeting room for all the missionaries. That evening we had a prayer meeting at our house. Afterwards some of the sisters were praying over one another. I still felt pretty shaken so I decided to ask for prayers. When they started praying over me one of the neighborhood women Tyresha got a word from the Lord. She said “God wants you to know what it’s like.” After she spoke her word I remembered that Tyresha had been in jail. She had spent some years in prison. God was allowing me some share in our neighbors’ experience of life. Later on Mary found out what had happened to me. She told me that when I knocked on her door she was in the waiting room at the probation office hoping to explain her plan for catching up on her probation payments. She hadn’t committed any new crimes and it really didn’t make any sense that they would have sent the marshals after her: she’d been sitting right in their office for hours! I think there’s something of the Incarnation in these experiences. Jesus already knows what it’s like to live in these houses to be one of the neighbors to experience fear sleepless nights and disrespect. He’s letting us feel what he feels which is what our neighbors feel. I thank God for giving me some share in the experience of our neighbors’ lives. He’s given me a gift. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Rich imagined a different kind of soccer experience one where children of different ages played in a single location where the focus was on fun and learning rather than on winning games an experience that would harmonize with community and family life. He credits Katy McShane a covenanted sister who died in 2010 with helping him get the program off the ground.  This year 26 adults and teenagers coached around 40 boys and girls grades K-6 two times a week during the month-long program. Third-grader Justin Heintzelman says “I really like scrimmaging even when it’s difficult like when I have to play against my older brother Josh!”    Boys and girls appreciate the individual attention they get from the coaches as well as the shorter-than-normal fields.

Trinity and Wilberforce faculty members on hand for faculty training joined them. Story by Sean Connolly. Photo by Jon Balsbaugh. A new high school will open its doors in Princeton New Jersey this fall thanks to a partnership between Trinity Schools and The Wilberforce School. The Wilberforce School (TWS) is an independent Christian school with 160 students. This year it is adding ninth and tenth grades to its previous pre-K through 8th grade offerings and the school expects to add 11th and 12th grades in coming years. Wilberforce high school students will follow Trinity’s curriculum in their math science and humanities courses and their teachers will receive ongoing training from Trinity master teachers. This makes the high school at Wilberforce the first of its type — a school that will license the Trinity curriculum and maintain an ongoing training relationship with Trinity’s teachers and administrative leaders. To reflect these close ties the school has a new designation Trinity Member School which it is already using in its marketing materials. Howe Whitman head of school at TWS and Kerry Koller president of Trinity Schools Inc. signed a contract formalizing the partnership on August 6. “It has been a joy to work with everybody at Trinity” Howe says. “When Wilberforce leaders learned about Trinity’s approach it seemed like the natural conclusion to the education we are already offering to lower and middle school students. We wanted to be able to offer those students the same kind of challenging and deep education that Trinity high school students receive an education that honors God and focuses on the true the good and the beautiful.” “I am very pleased” Kerry adds. “This is a new way for Trinity Schools and for the People of Praise to fulfill our goal of educating as many students as we can in a true and integral Christian humanism. We have been very impressed by the academic excellence at Wilberforce and by their leaders’ commitment to a Christian vision for education.” The new partnership is the result of two years of prayer conversation and work on the part of Howe Karen Ristuccia (TWS academic dean) and other TWS leaders together with Kerry Andrew Zwerneman (head of school at Trinity School at Meadow View) Paul Kane (Trinity’s vice-president of finance) and members of the Trinity School board of trustees. Connections between TWS and Trinity Schools go back to at least 2002 when Paul and Howe got to know each other through Paul’s brother Leo. Coincidentally Karen began to hear about Trinity through her nephews Justin and Jonathan Young who both graduated from Trinity School at Meadow View in Virginia. She visited the campus in 2011 and later that year Howe and a team from TWS also visited with Andrew and others at Meadow View. In 2012 Howe and Kerry began to talk seriously about the partnership. Then in January of 2013 Andrew and two Meadow View students Ben Mysliwiec and Mollie Clement traveled to Princeton to speak about Trinity to a gathering of TWS parents. This fall former Meadow View teacher Katherine Krall who recently moved to Princeton will become the first ninth-grade Humane Letters teacher at TWS. Another connection came in 2012 when a team from the People of Praise communications office (Greenlawn Films) produced a marketing video for TWS. There are already many similarities between Wilberforce and Trinity. Both started small and both began holding their classes in church buildings. Both school cultures feature small classes daily morning prayer and close relationships between teachers and students. Both admit students from a variety of Christian denominations and both have reputations for academic excellence.  A group of Christian parents founded TWS in 2005 naming it in honor of a British abolitionist and Christian member of parliament William Wilberforce (1759-1833). Fifteen students are enrolled in the new high school and Howe expects the enrollment to grow. The high school has already attracted some graduating TWS eighth graders. Howe says the high school classes will start out with boys and girls together but they will transition to single-sex classes in the future. “I want it to be as much like a Trinity School as possible” he says. Kerry adds “We’ve been very successful in spreading our curriculum in the past but this partnership gives a new dimension to our work. We are very grateful to the Lord to be working with The Wilberforce School in this mutual endeavor.”

20170927155110,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5831,May 5 2017 10:39 a.m.,Alumna to Lead Trinity School at River Ridge,Beth Schmitz (Servant Branch) a mathematics and Scripture teacher gifted speaker and leader among the faculty will be the next head of school at Trinity School at River Ridge. Beth who graduated from River Ridge in 2001 is the first Trinity School graduate to serve as the head of a Trinity School. She follows Jon Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) who will assume the role of president of Trinity Schools Inc. in the summer of 2017. Jon takes the helm from Kerry Koller (South Bend) who is stepping down as president after 36 years and will continue to serve Trinity Schools Inc. in an advisory role. Beth who can still remember getting directions to morning prayer from a senior on her first day of school in 1995 says she is humbled honored and grateful for the chance to lead her alma mater. “I look forward to continuing our work of offering students a truly excellent education one that allows them to develop their natural abilities but also helps them to identify other gifts they would not necessarily identify on their own so they can serve the Lord in whatever ways he calls them to serve” she said. Beth grew up in Prescott Wisconsin in Servant Branch’s East Area the daughter of Tony and Claudia Schmitz (Servant Branch). After graduating from River Ridge she attended the University of Minnesota at Morris where she majored in mathematics with minors in both music and statistics. She credits her time at Trinity with broadening her interests and helping her to discover a love for mathematics which she continues to nurture by reading mathematical books on her summer breaks. During her senior year in college a friend suggested she might make a good Trinity School teacher. Beth applied and was hired right out of college never looking back. This is her twelfth year on the faculty at River Ridge. Beth made the covenant of the People of Praise in 2009 and serves her branch as a handmaid. At Trinity she has taught Latin Scripture Catholic doctrine science MATLAB computer programming and every math course in the curriculum. “I love sitting down at a seminar table with students from different traditions and digging into the Scriptures together something we are only able to do because Trinity is an ecumenical school” Beth said. She has served as master teacher for the tenth grade Scripture course and for several mathematics courses. She developed the mathematics course for River Ridge’s new sixth grade and has trained math teachers at The Wilberforce School a Trinity member school in Princeton New Jersey. David O’Hanley (Servant Branch) a fellow science teacher says Beth has an unusual ability to tailor her mathematics lessons to the needs of individual students. “She has a reputation as someone who listens to and understands students” he said. Penny Arndt (Servant Branch) who has taught at River Ridge since 1987 called her “very collegial—an excellent teacher and an excellent mentor for other teachers.” “She is a clear and confident public speaker with a lot of gravitas” Kerry said. “She is a leader not only among the faculty at River Ridge but among the faculty of all our campuses and member schools. I am delighted that she has agreed to serve us in this new way.” “Beth has distinguished herself for her calm serious-minded and unwavering commitment to our mission” Jon Balsbaugh said. “She brings to the office of head of school her long experience as a teacher and a considerable breadth of perspective that goes back to her days as a Trinity student. She cares for her students individually and puts forth all her effort to help them make their learning their own.” Beth is the fifth head of school at River Ridge.
20170927155315,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5697,Feb. 16 2017 4:51 p.m.,Jon Balsbaugh Appointed Next President of Trinity Schools,Mr. Jon Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) the head of school at Trinity River Ridge and a 20-year veteran member of the faculty will be the next president of Trinity Schools Inc. He follows Dr. Kerry Koller (South Bend) who has filled the role of president since the founding of Trinity School in 1981 and will step down this summer.  “I am confident that Jon’s vision leadership and experience will carry our mission at Trinity forward into the future” said Dr. Craig Lent chair of the Trinity Schools board of trustees which hired Jon after an extensive search. As president Jon will be responsible for overseeing Trinity’s three campuses—in South Bend IN Eagan MN  and Falls Church VA—as well as relationships with two member schools The Wilberforce School in Princeton NJ and Trinity Academy in Portland OR. His term of office lasts for six years and is renewable. Jon and his wife Jen also a teacher at River Ridge have five children: Dietrich (Servant Branch) 19 Anna (Servant Branch) 17 Emily 15 Nora 12 and Charis 8. The Balsbaughs will move to South Bend this summer so Jon can begin his new job. His replacement as head of school at River Ridge will be chosen this spring Kerry said. Jon grew up in Adair Village OR a small town outside of Corvallis. He credits his educational formation to his parents a machinist and a stay-at-home mother who made financial sacrifices to send him to a private Christian high school. He earned a B.A. in English from The Master’s College in Santa Clarita CA. After he and Jen were married the Balsbaughs moved to Minnesota where Jon earned an M.A. at the University of St. Thomas writing his thesis on C.S. Lewis’s novel Till We Have Faces. There searching for what God might be calling him to do with his life he stumbled upon a news article about Trinity School at River Ridge. “I was instantly captivated” he said. Jon started teaching at River Ridge in 1997 where he and Jen encountered the community. “We saw something in the mission of the school the integrity of the people involved and the quality of the families that led us to make an underway commitment” Jon said. The Balsbaughs made the covenant in 2006 and Jon became the head of school at River Ridge in 2009. He is a tenured coordinator. Kerry said he was delighted by the choice. “Jon is a man of tremendous intellectual depth who has masterfully developed the community of learners at River Ridge. He is one of our most gifted teachers in part because he is also a model learner. His love of truth goodness and beauty is revealed in his vast intellectual and aesthetic interests. He has the Trinity DNA.” Steve Hendrickson (Servant Branch) a longtime math and science teacher credits Jon with cultivating a vibrant culture of learning. “One of his notable decisions was to declare Free Learning Day” Steve said. “To the great surprise of our students we announced the cancellation of regular classes offering the students and faculty the chance to spend the day pursuing different interests—reading poetry together learning Italian cooking exploring the world of J.R.R. Tolkien or studying special topics in mathematics. We expected it to go well but the response from the students far exceeded our expectations.” Beth Schmitz (Servant Branch) a math teacher and River Ridge alumna points to Mr. Balsbaugh’s eloquence and clarity as a speaker explaining Trinity’s vision to students faculty and parents alike. Jon’s 2015 opening address to the students entitled “Ideas are Dangerous” gained a national audience after it was posted on the Internet and republished by the popular education blog Intellectual Takeout.   Joe Gleason (South Bend) an editor for the film director Terrence Malick who is living on assignment in Austin TX says his friendship with Jon began in the classroom discussing The Brothers Karamazov and has grown stronger over the years. “We have great conversations over email and have gotten together over breaks to discuss books movies art music Christ and our lives. Jon’s interests include cooking film and fly fishing. He is a gifted photographer whose images help me see beauty in ordinary things.” “For more than 35 years Trinity Schools have been faithful to the call of the Lord to provide students with an education rooted in the pursuit of truth the practice of goodness and the creation of beauty” Jon said. “Kerry has provided visionary and courageous leadership that has kept us grounded in our mission. It is at once a great honor and a humbling prospect to follow him into the office of president. I am looking forward to getting to know the faculty staff students and alumni of each of our campuses better and to working closely with our Trinity member schools. The foundation laid by the community during the founding of Trinity Schools Kerry’s steady leadership our dedicated and passionate faculty and most importantly a sense of calling from the Lord to engage in this work give me great confidence for the future of Trinity Schools.”

20180118092807,http://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3345,Nov. 27 2013 4:44 p.m.,"In Missionary Work, Blessed Are the Annoying",In August George Kane moved to Evansville to join the Missionary Company. This article which he wrote originally appeared in the Nov. 15 2013 edition of The Message the weekly newspaper of the Catholic Diocese of Evansville IN. It is reprinted here with permission. By George Kane Missionaries don’t always receive warm welcomes. Sometimes our neighbors don’t know how to react when we show up in their front yard. In fact I ran into this situation on my first day of mission work in Evansville. It was Monday; and man it was hot. The August sun hit the asphalt and cooked up into our sandals as Dan and I walked along a deserted street. We crossed an intersection and saw three people talking by the curb a few houses down. “How about we talk to these guys?” Dan asked. I grinned and shrugged “Sure.” As a new missionary my job was to listen and learn from the others so I was happily off the hook when it came to starting conversations. “How y’all doing today?” Dan asked cheerfully extending his hand first to the 300-pound bald man standing on the curb and then to the man and woman straddling a moped. The big man took Dan’s hand coolly. “I’m Dublin” he said. He avoided Dan’s eyes and let go quickly. The man on the moped squinted at Dan’s open hand smirked and shook his head. “Naw man I’m not interested.”  A cold ulcer of embarrassment stung my stomach. I was unfamiliar with this kind of outright rejection which some of the veteran door-knocking missionaries affectionately call “eating doorknobs.” Dan was undeterred “Hey do you guys want to hear a story?” The man on the moped revved its engine and he and his passenger pulled away. “Holla a’chu later man!” Dublin called and then turned towards Dan and me. “Man I don’t want to be rude but I’m busy.” As he walked away around the corner I felt defeated. Not only did they not want to hear about the Gospel they didn’t even want to hear a word we had to say! All we had done was annoy them. Though I was upset about this then I found out later that Pope Francis actually may have been thrilled that I had gone out and been annoying that day. When speaking about proclaiming the gospel the Holy Father has said “Let us ask the Holy Spirit for this grace of apostolic zeal…and if we annoy people blessed be the Lord!” At that moment watching Dublin’s broad shoulders disappear around the corner I was pretty low on apostolic zeal. But Dan wasn’t. “Well shoot” he said “how about we knock at this house right here?” After two attempts at knocking though that door remained closed too. I was starting to feel even sorrier for myself when I heard behind us “Hey man the guy who lives there is crazy be careful.” It was Dublin! His bald head glinted under the sun and poured sweat into his eyes as he stood and talked with us. It turned out that Dublin used to be Lutheran but was now Muslim. The conversation started to drift towards argument when Dublin said “God knows all your sins even before you do them. It don’t matter what you want you gonna sin anyway. He’s got it all written in his book.” Dan raised his eyebrows. “But…aren’t I free? I’m gonna be tempted but I still have a choice about what I’m gonna do…right?” Dublin took a step back and brought one hand to his head waving the other at us “No man stop; you’re confusing me. I used to be confused about this stuff before … that was terrible being confused … I know what I believe now and I’m sticking to it.” When conversations about God start to get too close to home people often use this kind of theological debate as a smokescreen or sorts. So Dan changed the subject. “What if we pray for something together?” Dublin nodded slowly and then bowed his head and clasped his hands. He asked us to pray that God would provide for his family’s material needs and stood there quietly as we did just that. As we ended our prayer Dublin surprised us by saying “Thanks for being out here talking about God…people need it.” It was amazing. Dublin saw success where I could only see failure!

The man on the moped squinted at Dan’s open hand smirked and shook his head. “Naw man I’m not interested.”  A cold ulcer of embarrassment stung my stomach. I was unfamiliar with this kind of outright rejection which some of the veteran door-knocking missionaries affectionately call “eating doorknobs.” Dan was undeterred “Hey do you guys want to hear a story?” The man on the moped revved its engine and he and his passenger pulled away. “Holla a’chu later man!” Dublin called and then turned towards Dan and me. “Man I don’t want to be rude but I’m busy.” As he walked away around the corner I felt defeated. Not only did they not want to hear about the Gospel they didn’t even want to hear a word we had to say! All we had done was annoy them. Though I was upset about this then I found out later that Pope Francis actually may have been thrilled that I had gone out and been annoying that day. When speaking about proclaiming the gospel the Holy Father has said “Let us ask the Holy Spirit for this grace of apostolic zeal…and if we annoy people blessed be the Lord!” At that moment watching Dublin’s broad shoulders disappear around the corner I was pretty low on apostolic zeal. But Dan wasn’t. “Well shoot” he said “how about we knock at this house right here?” After two attempts at knocking though that door remained closed too. I was starting to feel even sorrier for myself when I heard behind us “Hey man the guy who lives there is crazy be careful.” It was Dublin! His bald head glinted under the sun and poured sweat into his eyes as he stood and talked with us. It turned out that Dublin used to be Lutheran but was now Muslim. The conversation started to drift towards argument when Dublin said “God knows all your sins even before you do them. It don’t matter what you want you gonna sin anyway. He’s got it all written in his book.” Dan raised his eyebrows. “But…aren’t I free? I’m gonna be tempted but I still have a choice about what I’m gonna do…right?” Dublin took a step back and brought one hand to his head waving the other at us “No man stop; you’re confusing me. I used to be confused about this stuff before … that was terrible being confused … I know what I believe now and I’m sticking to it.” When conversations about God start to get too close to home people often use this kind of theological debate as a smokescreen or sorts. So Dan changed the subject. “What if we pray for something together?” Dublin nodded slowly and then bowed his head and clasped his hands. He asked us to pray that God would provide for his family’s material needs and stood there quietly as we did just that. As we ended our prayer Dublin surprised us by saying “Thanks for being out here talking about God…people need it.” It was amazing. Dublin saw success where I could only see failure!
20180702173355,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5649,Feb. 1 2017 12:29 p.m.,Egged on by the Spirit,Dave Young in front of his Prius. by Dave Young Photo: Kiki Young Splat. An egg hit the window of my blue Prius and broke. The yolk ran down the glass. I was just a block from my home in the northern Virginia suburbs driving my family back from a Trinity play. Anger suddenly rose up within me. What if I had lost control? My family could have been hurt. I could have hit someone! I’m gonna get the perpetrator! I pulled over got out of the car and started searching. No one was on the street so I stalked into the backyard of one of the houses but it was empty. My wife Karen pointed to some egg on the ground near a driveway. I knocked on the door of the house. No answer. We drove home and I switched cars and went back parking nearby. Sure enough soon a high school-age boy came out of one of the houses and began wiping egg off the street. I got a good look at him went home and called the police. The officer who came out told me he couldn’t do anything since no one had witnessed the incident. I replied that I felt compelled to go back and talk to the boy’s parents. If one of my children had thrown an egg I’d want to know I reasoned. A few hours later my resolve about returning to the house had weakened. My peace had returned my car was clean and I was back to my life. I was ready to move on and really didn’t want to go up the street and confront anyone. But something inside of me—I’m convinced it was the Holy Spirit—urged me to return. I walked over to the house and noticed a car in the driveway and a man the boy’s father watering some plants. He looked at me warily. I explained what had happened. “Did he have blonde hair?” he asked. “Yes.” “That’s my son” he replied. He apologized courteously telling me that his son wasn’t home but that he would have him apologize to me and clean the car. I thought about ending the conversation and returning home but again the Spirit prompted me. “Is there some adversity going on in your son’s life?” I asked. Soon the dad was in tears telling me that his wife had left them that fall. As he shared his story I consoled him and prayed with him telling him that he was a hero for doing all he could for his children during such a hard time. Before I knew it more than an hour had passed so much time that my wife later told me she had been worried about me. The next day I went down the street again and met the boy but by that time my heart had done a 180-degree turn. I felt no need to give him a piece of my mind. I was an advocate and encourager instead of the adversary I had been the previous day. Over the next few months I stopped by the house to visit the father and son taking time to joke listen and encourage and pray with them. I became friends with the father and the son and I developed an easy rapport. Eventually the family moved from the neighborhood and we lost touch though the father and I remain friends on Facebook. This experience has reminded me that good can come from anything that the world or the devil throws our way . . . even an egg.

Libby Grondin who teaches music said this about this photo of one of the preschoolers which was taken last Tuesday: He ""had the opportunity to explore the cello for the first time. He was able to pluck and bow (with help) the strings but in order to get a better feel for how it makes such a big low sound he put his hands (and then his ear) to the cello's top. He was very excited and surprised at how much the cello vibrated!"""

The smaller child had tears in his eyes. When Andre stopped the car the larger boy explained that their house was burning.Andre drove quickly to the shack a wide structure built from plywood scraps and faded wooden signs for a beauty salon. He recognized it as the house where he was supposed to be delivering the food.“I could see flames in the roof” he recalled. The roof was a mixture of corrugated zinc panels and cardboard with the pieces held in place by large rocks.“I got out of the car and my daughter said ‘Where are you going Daddy? Be careful!’”Inside the dark shack Andre found the place where the ceiling was burning and saw a piece of cardboard hanging down also in flames. An electrical wire dangled from the ceiling charred and blackened.He grabbed a bedsheet and began waving it but fanning only made the fire grow stronger so he pulled down the piece of cardboard and flung it outside. There one of the children told him to look for a water bottle on a table—the shack had no running water. Back inside Andre felt around for the bottle grabbed it and used it to extinguish the flames in a roof beam along with the embers that had fallen onto the floor.“There was just enough water to put out the fire” he said.With the fire quenched Andre took the children to their mother who was in a nearby bar. She said she had left them with an uncle but he was nowhere to be found.“I praise God that I got there at that time” he said. “The fire department would never have arrived in time and the whole structure could have burnt.”

(Chris Vieck) by Chris Meehan After six trips three summer camps myriad work projects and the efforts of more than 500 people the 2017 Action summer is in the books. Here are some numbers and stories: Numbers • More than 310 children attended the summer camps in Evansville Allendale and Indianapolis. Allendale our longest-running camp led the way with 130 campers. • 156 people from 11 branches served as staff interns and volunteers. (In Evansville one of the volunteers was a young man named Xavier Anderson. He grew up in Allendale where he once attended camp.) • Also in Evansville the teams put in 1500 man hours moving 100 tons of dirt to help grade the yards of community members. “Y’all are making it beautiful” one passerby exclaimed. • Two hundred people came to a barbecue in Evansville which featured hamburgers and greens grown in the new start’s urban farm.    Evansville: John Zimmel discussed a Bible story with some of the youngest boys. (Dan Schwab)   Evansville: Anna (far left) and Kady Busekrus (far right) walked with the littlest girls’ group who were on their way to spend some time with Dan Sullivan (Mission Evansville) and learn about compasses and staying on the straight and narrow. (Sophie Tiller)  Evansville: Luke (center right) and Peter (reaching in from the right) played capture the flag with the boys in their group. (Dan Schwab)  Evansville: Kady Busekrus (facing camera northern Virginia) and Jessica Davis chatted as they planted seedlings at the urban farm. (Dan Schwab) Stories Addie Clark a sophomore from Portland recalls a story from the camp in Evansville: “After we read about Jesus’ baptism and talked about the meaning of baptism one girl came back the next day and announced that she had asked her mom if she could be baptized. Her mom said ‘Yes!’” Alex Rowland a staff member in Evansville used a comic book Bible for daily lessons with the 12-year-old boys in his camp group. One of the boys asked if he could have a Bible to keep so Alex arranged to give him one. “The Bible was an absolute hit” Alex said. “When the boy returned to camp he had already read halfway through it. He said he had read as much as he could while it was still light.” In Allendale the camp ran very smoothly with so few fights and problems that the boys and girls joined together on the last day for a camp-wide pizza party—“something we would not have attempted in previous years” according to Abby Earhart (Mission Evansville). Three boys from the Allendale camp were playing basketball when three more boys from another neighborhood joined them. John Crimmins (Mission Evansville) saw what happened: “The other boys were getting in the Allendale boys’ faces yelling. The Allendale boys didn’t cuss back. They were peaceful in the face of aggression but not backing down either. It was the Lord working through them.” John invited the three strangers to the barbecue where one of them said that he had noticed that the Allendale boys had been playing with a calmer attitude than he was used to. “We have to be super tough when we play in our neighborhood” the boy said. In Allendale the younger boys had fun pelting an 11-foot-high cardboard Goliath with water balloons while attacking him with swords made from foam and PVC pipe. Brad Elliott (northern Virginia) reports that they used the same swords to knight some of the boys to the service of Jesus Christ. Rachel Was an intern in Indianapolis remembers visiting with an older woman on her front porch who complained of extreme shoulder pain. The woman allowed Rachel and two others to pray with her. They prayed two times and then the woman told them that she felt no pain raising her elbow over her head. “You could tell from her face that the pain had gone away” Rachel said. In Indianapolis the staff ordered sub sandwiches from Walmart for the campers. When Amy Root (Servant Branch) came to pick them up the woman at the counter apologized because she had accidentally put extra meat on all the sandwiches. She explained that there would be no charge for the extra meat. When Amy thanked her and explained who the sandwiches were for the woman realized that her own daughter was attending the camp and would be eating her sandwiches. Ellen Putzier (Mission Indianapolis South Side) reports that in Indianapolis two girls had been unable to make peace with each other. They had gone through the motions of reconciliation but Ellen noticed a deep change when they enacted the roles of the prodigal son and his father in a skit. The girls said their lines with feeling and embraced. “It was strikingly beautiful” Ellen said.  Indianapolis: Some of the girls enjoyed a relay race involving Hula-Hoops.

And that must be Gretchen holding the baby shaking her head and smiling. Sean looks back: “Serious training going on here serious. Right kids? . . . just give us one minute.

Photos by Patricia Olson and Margaret DeCelles.  More than 200 students and adults from 11 community locations came to South Bend last weekend for an Action conference the first community-wide Action gathering in three years. “Never have I seen so many people devoted to what they are doing and focused on God” said Cameron Huntington a high school freshman from Minnesota. It was a working conference and participants spent several hours each day designing camp activities writing music producing videos or planning Action activities for the 2015-16 school year. In the music track they sang together listened to classical music and spiritual songs in addition to composing their own songs. On the final day they performed a camp song written by Stephen Kabele Abby Earhart James Smith Myracle Newsome and Sharon Joh about God’s manifestation to Elijah in the “still small voice.”  Camp track attendees planned and ran a day camp for youngsters aged 5-12 in the South Bend branch a trial run for this summer’s camps in Shreveport and Indianapolis. They performed skits (David and Goliath) taught about forgiveness helped the girls weave cloth headbands and ran an obstacle course with the boys. Video track participants took a crash course in visual storytelling and created their own short films. They developed storyboards filmed with iPhones and edited their films in time to show them on the final day of the conference. The track voted for the two best films--a short film of a missionary encounter created by Chris Smith Christian Runyon and Stephen Magill and a stylized film showing a job interview created by Joe Feeks Tess Pingel Ruthie Olson and David Preuss. A planning track focused on what Action students can do during the school year. They articulated a vision statement for local Action divisions brainstormed ways to improve Action events all year round and discussed fundraising. They went door-to-door in a nearby neighborhood asking people to join them in prayer for the nation. They knocked on 166 doors and prayed with 30 people.  The conference also included a variety of talks presentations and reports. Gabe Yohe a missionary in Evansville who was a high school student during the last Action conference shared his testimony as did his fellow missionary Ben Mysliwiec. Sarah Loughran (South Bend) gave a report on the elementary school the community will open in Allendale next fall. Action student Stephen Kabele (Vancouver-Portland) explained the Action coaching program while Mary Raway (Servant Branch) explained why she's in Action to the many newcomers attending the conference. “It was great hearing what Action divisions are doing in their branches hearing why the People of Praise is in the Mississippi River Valley and knowing that we have a plan” said Olivia Griggs a high school senior in South Bend. Exuberant praise and worship punctuated the sessions. Jared Gonzalez (Indianapolis Triangle) led the music with help from a large band of high school students playing drums bass electric guitar electric cello and mandolin. An evening variety show featured classical chamber music barbershop singing ukulele rap and several songs composed by the performers themselves. Conference participants served and cleaned up for all the meals enjoyed long walks in the spring weather late-night basketball and soccer games (for the boys) and a late-night live action Clue game at the Greenlawn mansion (for the girls).  The conference ended with a prayer meeting led by Pat Murphy (Servant Branch) during which the crowd sang music they’d learned in the last few days and received an invitation from missionary Nick Holovaty to start preparing now to join the Lord’s campaign in the Mississippi River Valley. Peter Kabele a senior from Portland has already noticed fruit from the conference. “Every single day I’ve had conversations with people who went to the conference about the Holy Spirit the changes the Lord has made in their lives and about what we want do in Action moving forward.” “The Lord certainly showed up” says program coordinator Mike Zusi. “The South Bend branch poured itself out to serve us. I can't say enough about the administrative work of Catherine Bulger—the conference wouldn't have happened without her—or the dedicated service of Andrea Kane who organized all the food and housing. I expect we'll be seeing the fruit of this conference for quite some time.”

Photo by Beth Kabele. Dick Safranski an 82-year-old widower from Portland can't stop talking about the birthday gift his People of Praise neighbors gave him on January 26. That evening members of the Clark Kabele and Ridenour families crowded into his home and prayed with him to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. ""Getting prayed over was spectacular"" he says. The story began at the regular Monday night dinner that the Clark Kabele Brady and Ridenour families hold. They were talking about people they knew who might be open to being baptized in the Holy Spirit. (At their community meeting the day before they had heard a talk from the ""Spread the Fire"" series developed by Kevin Ranaghan and Louis Grams about praying with people for the baptism of the Holy Spirit.) Someone brought up Dick Safranski. Dick has lived in the same neighborhood-where several community families also live-for 19 years. He loved to walk around the block once or twice daily with Gloria his wife of 61 years. ""They knew everybody"" Pat Clark says. As Gloria battled cancer during the last six years of her life community families prayed over her many times. She died March 27 2013. During the dinner Pat noted that it was Dick's birthday and suggested the group go over and sing to him. Dan Kabele raised the stakes: ""Why don't we give him something that nobody else has given him?"" They all trooped over to his house but Dick was at his daughter's home for dinner so they sang into a cell phone before returning to Kabeles'. Dick arrived home minutes later to discover a message on his answering machine-muffled voices singing ""Happy Birthday."" He didn't recognize the number but called back. When the crowd realized Dick had returned they rushed back and sang to him again from his front porch. After they reminisced about Gloria and the blessings of his past year Dan said ""Dick we have something to give you for your birthday–would you like to be prayed with to be baptized in the Holy Spirit?"" Dick's eyes welled up with tears and he replied that he had always loved it when they prayed with Gloria and he wanted prayer as well. Dick was struck by Beth Kabele's voice over his shoulder speaking in tongues. ""They talked about bringing the Holy Spirit into the house and me"" he remembers. ""They did and he did!"" The next morning Dick told his family and his parish priest about what had happened to him and since then as Dan says ""He's been telling everybody he knows."" Beth notes that Dick has always been God's man. ""His example of a faith-filled life has impacted those around him in the neighborhood. He is highly respected as a steady faithful good patient and loving man. That's why we were so drawn to him from the first days of meeting him and Gloria."" ""I was a 'cradle Catholic'"" says Dick ""growing up in a Polish family with seven children and a love of the church. I've always been active in my parish but after being prayed with I'm even more cognizant of what's going on there. The word 'spectacular' doesn't cover it. I felt different since being prayed with; God has compensated me for losing my sweetheart. My faith keeps getting deeper."""

Story by Chris Meehan. Photo by Bob Cunningham.Servant Branch has begun live video broadcasts of their branch meetings that members can watch on the Internet. The broadcasts which are only available to Servant branch members are a new way for brothers and sisters who can’t attend the meeting because of illness old age travel etc. to participate in the life of their branch. “We wanted to help absent branch members be more united in heart and mind with those in the meeting room” explains principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler. The project is just four months old but reports from branch members indicate that it has already begun to fulfill its purpose. Pat Walsh is a long time branch member who suffers from post-polio symptoms and hasn’t been able to attend meetings for about 10 years. In the past she listened to the meeting at least a few days later on CD but now she watches it live and can talk about it afterward with her housemate Penny Arndt. “The broadcasts show my brothers and sisters as they sing and pray and that helps me feel more a part of what’s going on and join in” she says. Shane and Diane Drefcinski live in Platteville Wisconsin about 250 miles from the Twin Cities. They’ve been on assignment there for over a decade so Shane can teach philosophy at the Platteville campus of the University of Wisconsin. “It was often difficult to corral all six of our kids together to listen to an audio recording” Diane says “but now on Sunday afternoons I can call out ‘The community meeting’s on’ and they’ll gather around to watch and listen.” They look for their friends relatives and their sister Angela in particular. “We feel more connected and we are grateful to have this option now.” Nancy Caneff traveled from the Twin Cities to Florida recently to care for her 91-year-old mother. “On a day when my husband Tom gave a talk my mother and I were able to watch as he gave it. It was wonderful to recognize faces and voices; I felt present with the branch. As I sat on the side of Mom’s bed we sang along with some of the older charismatic songs she remembered.” The idea for the broadcasts came about six years ago when a group of branch members began meeting to talk about how to help aging community members. Last year the branch’s CD duplicator broke and Joel saw an opportunity. He spoke to the branch coordinators and they agreed to study how many people could benefit from live video broadcasts. After the study the numbers looked sufficient to justify the expense so Joel asked Tom Bowar to begin researching equipment. Eventually on Tom’s recommendation the branch purchased two video cameras along with a tripod and a computer to run the system. Now Tom leads a team of five that includes Ken Larsen Dan Laust Elizabeth Pease and John Gruber. A typical community meeting requires a three-person crew including two camera operators and someone to manage the computer where the feeds are mixed together and processed for Internet viewing. Two cameras on tripods are positioned at the back of the auditorium facing the stage. A third camera controlled by a remote will be used starting in December. It will be mounted at the front of the room where it can pick up shots of branch members. John a senior at Trinity River Ridge says that he enjoys working on the crew. “Every week there’s something different to deal with and learn about. People who are watching will often text Tom directly if there’s a glitch. We’re constantly changing and improving.” The glitches have been there Tom admits but branch members say the broadcasts have been getting better with each meeting. “We’re still learning and we want the production to be high-quality.” After the meetings the video recordings are archived and placed on a private page on the website Vimeo.com where branch members can access them for about three weeks. Gary Luzar lives 42 miles from River Ridge and has back problems that have kept him from recent meetings. He says: “It’s cool that the meetings are accessible to people in my situation.”

Story by Chris Meehan. Photo courtesy of Greenlawn Films. Marriage in Christ an outreach sponsored by Servant Branch conducted a training institute for couples from across the community from September 5 to 7. Sixteen couples from 10 community branches traveled to the Twin Cities to attend the three-day institute held at the River Ridge branch center. Its goal was to expand the Marriage in Christ (MIC) seminar nationwide by training the couples so they can put on seminars in their local areas. “Our goal with MIC is to share some of the wisdom God has given us in the community about marriage” says principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler who serves on the MIC executive committee with Bob Brickweg and Bill Wacker. “We want to help many more couples acquire the power of the Holy Spirit renew their relationships with God and strengthen their friendships with each other.” The seminars are aimed at the general public but community couples can also benefit from attending Joel says. They are ecumenical in their content and approach. The seminar consists of five weekly sessions of talks and discussions usually hosted by local churches. Topics covered include strengthening the couple’s relationship with God and with each other sin as an obstacle to a loving marriage the Holy Spirit and practical areas such as sexuality forgiveness and family life. Couples perform homework between the sessions taking 20 minutes each day to pray to grow in friendship through conversation and to perform small acts of love and service for each other. Couples pay around $100 to attend the seminar which includes manuals they can use for follow-up. The institute in September also featured the debut of a new series of five videos produced by Greenlawn Films in South Bend. The videos rely on short dramas and personal stories to cover the basic teaching points of the seminar and they will replace the talks in the future. Greenlawn Films spent a year developing the videos writing scripts holding auditions and rehearsals then filming and editing. Servant Branch couples Bob and Christine Brickweg and Tom and Nancy Caneff are the presenters. South Bend branch members Joe Gleason and Elizabeth Grams directed the episodes and Sean Connolly was the producer. “The quality of the videos is nothing short of spectacular” said Mike Freeman (Vancouver-Portland) who attended the institute with his wife Kathy. “They are tangible and beautiful expressions of the fruit of Christianity in marriage.” At the institute couples attended a condensed version of the seminar and learned the ins and outs of putting it on successfully. They received a kit with the materials needed to host seminars including the videos and manuals. “It was exciting to see something concrete that we can offer to the wider world” said Natalia Bendele (Shreveport) who also attended the institute. Bill Wacker who directs the MIC outreach says that the idea originated in 2010 after Servant Branch members heard prophetic words about outreach. Bill has had a longtime interest in the Bible’s teaching on marriage and he and Joel began talking about starting a marriage outreach. Soon Bill’s wife Adella joined the discussion along with Bob and Christine Tom and Nancy Sam and Mary Claassen Chris and Peggy Dietzen Dave and Peg Louiselle George Wolney and Jan Sweere. “We did a lot of experimentation and had many conversations among ourselves and with the community’s board of governors before we came up with what we have now. Once we got going we also got feedback from participants” Bill says. Since 2011 Servant Branch members have put on more than 20 MIC seminars in area churches and at River Ridge. Three hundred couples have attended. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis has welcomed MIC to several of its parishes and a diocese in Iowa is interested in spreading the seminar in their area. Over the course of the last nine months the MIC team has been gearing up to spread the seminar more widely. They hired one:ten communications to redesign their web site and worked with Greenlawn Films to produce the video series. They overhauled their manual to make it easier for couples to use and they hired Laura Brickweg in Servant Branch to work as an administrator. They have a seminar scheduled soon at St. John Neumann Church in Eagan MN and they are planning to hold another training institute from November 14 to 16. Learn more at www.marriageinchrist.com.

By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly. Photo by Chris Meehan. Craig Lent has announced that the South Bend branch will have a new principal branch coordinator beginning in October. Rich Was will start a six-year term on October 15. Rich follows John Zwerneman who served two consecutive six-year terms. Rich 50 is a tenured coordinator who has served three terms as an area coordinator in South Bend. He has been married to Trice (Rose) for 25 years and they have five children: Christina 24; Rich 22; Katie 19; John 16 and Rachel 13. Rich runs a State Farm Insurance agency in South Bend and has worked for State Farm for 23 years. He is a native of South Bend with a degree in economics and management from DePauw University where he played on the football team. “Rich is well respected by branch members and by his brother coordinators” Craig says. “I am grateful for his willingness to take responsibility for leading the branch and for serving his brothers and sisters in this new way.” At the branch meeting where he made the announcement Craig explained the process for selecting principal branch coordinators. “The branch coordinators meet have an election and nominate three men for the office of principal branch coordinator. The overall coordinator picks from those three names and forwards his choice to the board of governors for confirmation.” Of John Craig said simply “He has done a terrific job” before his words were interrupted by prolonged applause and cheering. John was elected to serve on the board of governors in May. His six-year term begins on December 1. The branch will have a chance to honor John at a later date Craig said.

20180703215204,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6632,June 27 2018 10:09 a.m.,An Urban Resurrection,Kelly Park has been completely rebuilt through the efforts of neighborhood children and adults and will be formally dedicated this summer. by Elizabeth Grams Photos: Margaret Anderson; courtesy of Beth Sanford For Lu Ella Webster a lifelong resident of South Bend’s northeast neighborhood Kelly Park is a place of happy memories. She can recall playing with other children black and white together on the domed monkey bars and pump merry-go-round back in the 1950s when the park was new. But in more recent years she says the park became run-down. Some neighbors would warn children not to play there. There were hypodermic needles on the ground and cars speeding close to the remaining playground equipment made it dangerous for little ones. The park’s one bench had broken slats. Its swingset and basketball hoops were faded and worn. Today the park has been rebuilt from the ground up with two basketball half-courts a pavilion a perimeter fence new playground equipment and dozens of beautiful trees. This summer South Bend city representatives will gather with neighbors and friends to cut the ribbon across the park’s brand new entrance and officially dedicate it. The seeds of the park’s resurrection lay in the dreams of a group of neighborhood children. With the help of many others moved by those dreams Beth Sanford (South Bend) and her friend and neighbor Lu Ella turned them into a reality. They raised $220000 in donations and pushed the reconstruction forward from start to finish. Matt and Beth Sanford and their children live half a block away from Kelly Park. They’ve watched their neighborhood change in recent years as new houses were built attracting families connected with the University of Notre Dame located just to the north. Wealthier households moved in next to or replaced middle or lower-income families. Kelly Park remained uninviting and unsafe until some neighborhood children voiced a desire to change it.  These eight-to-twelve-year-olds from the nearby Robinson Community Learning Center initiated the renovation of Kelly Park and raised the first $6000 in grant money. The children were attending a program at Robinson Community Learning Center a Notre Dame-sponsored outreach to the neighborhood. After taking a closer look at their neighborhood through the program they told their leader Lu Ella that if they could improve one thing about their neighborhood it would be Kelly Park. In 2013 the group of a dozen eight-to-twelve-year-olds made a small grant proposal for park renovations that was approved. Lu Ella still lives on the property where she was born and raised directly across the street from Kelly Park. She says her family—she’s one of 15 children—were the first African-Americans to move into the neighborhood. She has been a leader in neighborhood projects and helped the children develop and publicize their hopes for the park. In 2013 Beth was a stay-at-home mother of five and also an architect by training. With her children in school she was starting to feel a creative itch. She asked the Lord about it and decided she should offer to help Lu Ella. She had no idea that she had just gotten herself into a five-year project.  Beth Lu Ella and neighborhood boys joined Fr. Ed Silvia C.S.C. as he recently blessed the park. “The first thing we did was to have a design charrette with the kids” Beth says. “We worked with them to draw pictures of what they wanted. They wanted a basketball court a walking path for parents to exercise while their children play a gated playground a place that was handicapped-accessible. They wanted benches for adults and elderly people a pavilion and grill. What they wanted was not just for themselves but for the community. I was really inspired.” Beth and Lu Ella and their team took the design proposals to the city’s parks department. “They told us ‘That’s great! We don’t have any money.’ So we said ‘Neither do we! Okay we’ll raise it.’” Beth and Lu Ella started pounding the pavement. They quickly secured a $10000 donation from a neighborhood revitalization association. They approached their neighbors around the corner the owners of a local business who wrote out a check for $7500 on the spot. Encouraged they kept going eventually securing tens of thousands of dollars towards the renovation.  One iteration of Beth’s landscape plans. Beth worked with vendors cutting costs and asking for discounts on materials and labor. She found out that Indiana masonry workers had an apprenticeship program and asked if they could build the entrance piers for free. “I brought this really architecturally pretty drawing of the piers and the guy in charge said “That’s great but I can’t build that”—because they’re just first-year apprentices. And I said ‘Oh! Well what can you build?’ So we sat and modified the drawing.” She worked with neighborhood children and youth groups to help clean up trash in the park. She spoke with neighbors about what was going on in the park and asked for their input and she and Lu Ella kept in touch with city officials. They made sure to express their thanks to everyone involved. “Lu Ella and I fed the masons a full meal and they said ‘Wow we always just get cold pizza!’” Beth had plenty to learn since her background had been mainly in commercial residential and light industrial architecture. “As an architect I’m a research junkie” she says. “I started contacting my friends who are landscape architects to get their opinions. I called the manufacturers of the swingset: ‘this is how I’m interpreting your safety standards. Is this correct?’ I found out how expensive playground equipment is about the requirements for loose-fill barriers about surface materials and their compaction rates. Even things like where to put the grills and trash cans—you have to think about it from the city’s maintenance standpoint. I felt like it was God’s gift to me that I got to do this.”  Beth utilized all the volunteer manpower she could find like these apprentice bricklayers to help with the renovation. Beth’s son James saw kids playing on the new courts even before the paint was down. “The courts are definitely very well used. With two separate courts now you can have a playful game with grade school kids and a real scrimmage with some high schoolers. I think that was really smart.” At the Sanford house family mealtime conversations often came back to the park. Matt works as a machinist in the Notre Dame Department of Physics shop which donated scrap metals to the local blacksmiths’ guild where the men designed and built the new entrance sign for the park and a sculptural bike rack designed like a carousel. Matt himself engraved the plaques on each of the park benches with the names of donors. James brought fellow Trinity classmates out to help paint the new fencing. “Our family unit has grown in patience and support” Matt says. “We pray for Beth’s work at the park and we’re proud. The Lord has guided her.” After working together so long Beth and Lu Ella call one another sisters and their families have become close. “When something goes wrong we text each other: ‘Remember the Lord is in it.’ Every step of the way we said ‘Lord lead us to the people you want to lead us to and to the people you want me to ask for money.’”  Beth got involved in all aspects of the project even forging part of the sculptural bike rack. This year workers planted 26 boxwoods and 116 trees including 83 arborvitaes that created a green screen around two sides of the park. Recently Beth noticed that someone had been stealing some of the shrubs. As she was thinking about what to do she saw a woman walk into the park with a wagon and some dirt looking like she was about to take off with another shrub. Beth started to pray and got the sense that instead of confronting the woman she should listen to her. The woman began talking about how Notre Dame had paid for all the plants and how she and some friends were going to come over and fertilize them. Beth explained to her that she and others had raised the money to renovate the park showing her pictures of the renovation. While they were talking a group of boys rode up on their bikes and Beth invited them to help water the plants. Soon the woman was helping to clean up around the plants and the boys started to help her. “God bless you” the woman said to Beth. “You’re good with these boys.” She left promising to come back and help again. “Beth and Lu have been great partners” says John Martinez Director of Facilities and Grounds for South Bend’s parks department which honored the two women as volunteers of the year in spring 2018. (They even got to throw out the first pitch for a South Bend Cubs minor league baseball game.) “This has been well-received by the whole neighborhood” said John. “I wish we had more neighborhood groups like them.” “It’s a good feeling” Lu Ella says seeing the fruit of their labors every day from her home. “One day there must have been a hundred kids over here in the park and what a blessing to hear the laughter! And the Notre Dame law students had their family picnic over here. We had a man whose wife passed and they wanted to have a celebration for her and all the family were saying let’s do it at Perley Park and he said ‘No she grew up across the street. This is the park she played in.’ They had it here in the park. And then they did fireworks later on at night and it was beautiful.”  Neighborhood children make good use of the park’s new playground equipment. Now Beth sees neighborhood families rich and poor alike playing alongside one another in the new park. “For me learning how to build a park is one thing but now I can see the social impact and I know how God has had his hand in it . . . you have all the expensive new homes coming in next to all the older homes that have middle to lower-income families. Before the new families would not even come to this park. Now you’re starting to see the neighborhood coming together. It’s like a place of union.”

Soon the woman was helping to clean up around the plants and the boys started to help her. “God bless you” the woman said to Beth. “You’re good with these boys.” She left promising to come back and help again. “Beth and Lu have been great partners” says John Martinez Director of Facilities and Grounds for South Bend’s parks department which honored the two women as volunteers of the year in spring 2018. (They even got to throw out the first pitch for a South Bend Cubs minor league baseball game.) “This has been well-received by the whole neighborhood” said John. “I wish we had more neighborhood groups like them.” “It’s a good feeling” Lu Ella says seeing the fruit of their labors every day from her home. “One day there must have been a hundred kids over here in the park and what a blessing to hear the laughter! And the Notre Dame law students had their family picnic over here. We had a man whose wife passed and they wanted to have a celebration for her and all the family were saying let’s do it at Perley Park and he said ‘No she grew up across the street. This is the park she played in.’ They had it here in the park. And then they did fireworks later on at night and it was beautiful.”  Neighborhood children make good use of the park’s new playground equipment. Now Beth sees neighborhood families rich and poor alike playing alongside one another in the new park. “For me learning how to build a park is one thing but now I can see the social impact and I know how God has had his hand in it . . . you have all the expensive new homes coming in next to all the older homes that have middle to lower-income families. Before the new families would not even come to this park. Now you’re starting to see the neighborhood coming together. It’s like a place of union.”

20180703215438,http://peopleofpraise.org:80/news/?p=3349,Dec. 9 2013 5:06 p.m.,Thanksgiving Surprise for Allendale Family,By Chris Meehan Some community members brightened the Thanksgiving celebrations of an Allendale family late last month. On the Tuesday evening before Thanksgiving Kathleen Mehaffey and Ben Reinhardt brought a basket to the home of a family with four children. The basket contained a 14-pound turkey dressing potatoes vegetables and dessert. The father of the family answered the door and shook their hands vigorously as he accepted the food. “Oh wow” he said. “The kids will be so happy. I can’t wait to tell them in the morning. They’ve been asking for turkey but it’s been several years since we could afford one.” The mother told them that she had been planning to buy a ham the next morning—all the family could afford. “This makes my day” the father added laughing. “I was getting tired of ham!” The basket came from Shreveport branch member Gwen Stuart. Gwen had been helping with a Thanksgiving-week food giveaway at the church where she works. The supervisor of the giveaway had given Gwen two food baskets to deliver to needy families. Gwen was unable to make contact with one family despite repeated phone calls and knocks on their door. The supervisor asked Gwen if she knew anyone else who could use the meal. “I’m sure I can find someone” Gwen replied thinking of the community’s outreach in Allendale. On Tuesday she dropped off the basket at the Allendale home of Ron and Ruthanne Seitz. The basket migrated from the Seitzes to the single women’s house headed by Kathleen. Over dinner the women brainstormed the names of families who might benefit from the basket and eventually settled on the family with four children. Some of the children had come to the community’s summer camp but the women wanted to get to know the parents better. “I think the Lord was being very specific in his care for those neighbors” says Kathleen. “We didn’t have reason to believe that they were any worse off than all the other poor families who live in our neighborhood but the Holy Spirit prompted us so we took the food to them.”

Below is an explication of the covenant which Paul gave at the 1976 covenant-making community meeting in South Bend. At the end of the talk Paul read the covenant aloud. You may notice that it differs slightly from the version we use today. In January 1986 the board of governors approved two revisions to the covenant. The first is that the word “basic” was omitted to avoid confusion with other unrelated groups known as “basic communities.” The second is that the word “Church” was made lowercase to better reflect the diversity of our various denominations. We hope that reading and discussing this will deepen your appreciation of what the Lord has called us to.  Barb Potts (right) congratulates Audrey Rebar on making the covenant in Corvallis on October 15.

20180710023820,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=1929,June 16 2011 9:02 p.m.,Lloyd Mehaffey to Lead New Orleans Branch,"By Chris Meehan  Mike Coney (left) and Lloyd Mehaffey. (Credit: Linda Coney) Lloyd Mehaffey began serving as the principal branch coordinator for the New Orleans branch on June 15. He follows Mike Coney who has served for two consecutive six-year terms as PBC. Mike continues to serve on the community's board of governors and as the coordinator responsible for the Biloxi Mobile and Shreveport branches. He says he is looking forward to serving the New Orleans branch however he can in the future. “Lloyd is an experienced branch coordinator” says Kevin Ranaghan chair of the branch relations council. “I have always been impressed by his deep understanding of our community life which will be a big help to him and the other brothers and sisters.” Born and raised in New Orleans Lloyd has been a member of the branch since it became part of the People of Praise in 1986. Lloyd and his wife Kathy were also members of the group that preceded it the Community of Jesus the King. During his years at Hendrix College in Conway AR Lloyd started interdenominational prayer meetings on campus and did street witnessing in nearby Little Rock. “I always thought the Lord was ecumenical so why shouldn’t I be the same way?” he asks with a laugh. In the last few months Lloyd Kathy and other branch members have occasionally visited a local park to evangelize and pray with strangers. As vice-president and part owner of Mehaffey & Daigle Inc. he sells industrial raw materials to plastics pharmaceuticals and chemicals companies in five states which requires a day trip every week or two. Lloyd and Kathy have six children ages 15-30 (Dan Kathleen Stacy Emily Shannon and Megan) two still at home. He has a strong baritone voice and for many years Lloyd sang in the branch’s music ministry. “I am extremely happy Lloyd will lead us” says Bill Wiltz (New Orleans). “He’s a one-of-a-kind guy and one of the main reasons I’m in the People of Praise. He’s never too busy to help and was on the phone with me almost every day of the nine months we were out of our home due to Hurricane Katrina.” During Mike Coney’s twelve years as head of the branch Hurricane Katrina was a defining moment says Tom Evans (New Orleans).  “I clearly remember our first branch meeting after Katrina. We had all been dispersed over several states for about six weeks. It was Mike who contacted us all to ‘Come on home’ for a Lord’s Day celebration and community meeting at his home which had escaped flooding. All of us who could make it did and we had a joyous reunion everybody catching up on everybody else’s stories. It was a wonderful moment for us all and Mike presided.” Branch member Phil Slattery notes that Mike has always been a strong leader in the branch. ""And after serving as a coordinator for around 20 years Mike isn’t looking forward to a rest but for one more way to serve.” Kevin says that Mike wears many hats very well: husband father grandfather deacon lawyer and coordinator. “He combines wisdom with a pastoral gift that is life-giving. He has a passion for branch unity that was very evident in the aftermath of Katrina. We’re fortunate that he will continue to serve on the board of governors and with his wife Linda on the branch relations team.” Branch member Elaine Chetta comments that Mike is very generous man using his time and talents for God’s glory. Her husband Nick agrees pointing out the time Mike opened his house up to their family during Hurricane Georges in 1998. “Mike did a great job and I trust Lloyd to do the same” adds Tucky Argus. ""I’m very peaceful grateful and happy in this time of change."""

By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. A Broad OutreachIn recent years the People of Praise is perhaps best known as the founder of Trinity Schools three junior high/high schools which between them have won eight Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. For more than 35 years our schools have had a reputation for encouraging students to ask questions engage in spirited dialogue and draw their own reasoned conclusions. “I know of no better school in these United States” the late political philosopher Russell Kirk said of our flagship school in South Bend IN. Then there is our missionary work. Over the past 15 years the People of Praise has sent more than 100 people to live in some of America’s forgotten corners—places like Ms. Anderson’s Shreveport neighborhood where the per capita income is under $14000. There we and our neighbors have built and renovated homes run summer camps for thousands and started an elementary school for our neighborhood Praise Academy at Lakeside. In Evansville IN a group of People of Praise missionaries moved into two houses at a notorious intersection a place locals called “the devil’s corner” because of all the fights and drug deals. We didn’t arrive with any program or magic formula but hoped to encounter neighbors in a spirit of Christian friendship. Even so our neighbors have told us that crime has dropped off significantly because of the community we and they are building. “Every night there would be something bad going on and the police would have to park and just watch everybody” one long-time Evansville resident said. “It’s just remarkable how things have changed.”  On another front our community life provides a natural support for marriages and families and this has led us to develop Marriage in Christ a five-week course that equips couples to pray together and build crucial habits of conversation. More than 1000 couples have completed the program.Our RootsThe People of Praise has some of its roots in the Pentecostal revival that grew from a group of poor African Americans in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. Those humble believers experienced a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewal of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues. They were ridiculed in the press called “fanatics” and mocked for their lively worship. But the revival went on to inspire half a billion people including millions of Roman Catholics. The People of Praise also has roots in the Cursillo an evangelistic movement founded in Spain by Catholic laymen in the 1940s which spread to Mexico and the United States influencing some of our founding members. In 1971 after nearly seven years spent praying and studying the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers 29 people made a covenant commitment to put their lives and their futures in common. The People of Praise was born. Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage. Imperfect words will eventually fade but we remain happy and proud to be the category-defying community God has called us to be his People of Praise.   Sean Connolly (@sconnoll) is the communications director for the People of Praise community.

Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage. Imperfect words will eventually fade but we remain happy and proud to be the category-defying community God has called us to be his People of Praise.   Sean Connolly (@sconnoll) is the communications director for the People of Praise community.

20180828114032,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work! Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”

About the ebook: The Second Vatican Council: Ecumenical and Apolitical is a short essay exploring two less-noticed aspects of the Council. The Council was ecumenical in the broadest sense of the term. Protestant and Orthodox observers were given places of honor in the Council sessions and treated as brothers united by a common baptism. New ecumenical connections and friendships formed at the Council helped open the way for major steps toward Christian unity in the second half of the 20th century. This same spirit of unity was also apparent in the Council Fathers' approach to decision-making. Rather than forming political factions and rivalries that jostled for position the Council Fathers worked together respectfully striving for unity of mind and heart. This led to some surprising results: virtual unanimity in many major decisions. Author Paul DeCelles writes ""Often the press at least the United States press reported on the Council as if it were a power struggle between progressives and conservatives. The Council was not however a factious political debate; it was rather an open sometimes sharp but always thoughtful exchange of ideas. That's part of the glory of the Council. Often people changed their minds. . . . It was a radically Christian way of doing things."" About the author: Paul DeCelles is a founding member of the People of Praise an ecumenical charismatic covenant Christian community headquartered in South Bend Indiana. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Johns Hopkins University and did research at Brookhaven National Laboratory the Institute for Advanced Study CERN and the University of Notre Dame. Currently he is the chairman of the board of the LaSalle Company and coordinates the People of Praise’s outreach efforts."
20190107090250,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5970,July 12 2017 10:03 p.m.,“God Wants You to Know What It’s Like”,People of Praise missionary Chris Vieck. by Chris Vieck Photos: Joe Gleason Mary Timler Dan Sullivan Editor’s note: Chris Vieck is a missionary in the new start in Evansville. She is a member of the Sisterhood. We moved onto the corner of Linwood and Madison in Evansville on Good Friday 2012. Right onto the toughest corner of one of the toughest neighborhoods in town. One of our neighbors told us “You’re moving right into the heart of the hood.” I knew that the Lord had given us those houses and given us that strategic location but I didn’t realize that he was also going to give me opportunities to experience what life is really like for our neighbors there. I grew up on a farm near Vincennes Indiana. Our large family always had enough money and more than enough friends. From there I went to college in South Bend joined the People of Praise and shortly thereafter became part of the Sisterhood. Because of my education and background I knew how to speak and behave in such a way that I would be treated with respect. And I always had been.   The intersection of Linwood and Madison in Evansville was once referred to as “Devil’s Corner” because it was the site of so many fights and drug deals. Soon after our household of sisters moved onto the corner we started getting sick. We’d been cleaning our rental house for days but we couldn’t get rid of the stench. Was it old urine? Mold? Or worse had someone been making meth there? We didn’t know. We just knew that we’d been using gallons of bleach but the odor in the house was so strong you couldn’t even smell any bleach. We spent two weeks in South Bend while the missionary brothers worked on fixing the problem for us. New cabinets and countertops ductwork cleaned a new ceiling black mold removed and a repaired furnace later the problem was fixed. It turned out that thousands upon thousands of cockroach carcasses (thankfully long dead) were responsible for that sickening smell. That was a first taste of what it’s like but unlike our neighbors we had the manpower and means to fix it. Once the smell was gone I was so eager to be in the neighborhood. I slept like a baby that first night but within a week I started waking up in the middle of the night anxious and afraid. I didn’t know why. I thought it was the enemy so after our neighborhood women’s group one night I asked for prayers. During the prayer Netesha got a word from the Lord: “God wants you to know what it’s like for women in this neighborhood only they don’t know how to fight.” When she said that I remembered hearing neighbors talk about what sounded to me like paranoia at night. Netesha was right they didn’t know how to fight how to pray against the devil. God had given me another taste of what our neighbors’ life is like but unlike them I had the means to fight. After the prayer I went back to sleeping soundly. A year or two later on a warm summer afternoon I went to visit Mary who lives a few houses down from us. I had been talking with Carrie Johnson when I realized I was supposed to meet Mary at one o’clock. She didn’t answer the door so I started jogging back to Carrie’s house. While I was running a shiny white SUV pulled up next to me. The driver was wearing a White Sox cap and jersey. He yelled at me “Hey come over here! It’s the police!” I thought no way! All I could think of were stories I had heard of men impersonating police officers and abducting women so I kept going. He kept yelling at me and finally he flashed a set of police lights and blared the siren for a second. So I stopped. I still didn’t know what was going on but I was cornered. He got out of the car and flashed a badge. Again I thought of the stories I had heard: don’t believe a flashed badge. Right away a shiny black sports car pulled up as well and that guy got out too. The first guy yelled at me “I told you we’re US marshals! When I say stop you stop!” I wish I’d had the presence of mind to say to them “Do you know what neighborhood you’re in accosting a woman like this?” But it all happened so quickly I couldn’t think straight. Two of the missionary brothers Evan Lent and Joe Cassell had seen the whole thing from their house and they tried to approach me to help out but the second marshal kept them back. They couldn’t get closer to me than 30 feet. I was totally alone and I was so confused. What was going on? Why were they stopping me? What had I done wrong? Why was he yelling at me? The first marshal started grilling me and he was very aggressive. I was so intimidated. “Why were you running? What’s your name? Who were you visiting? What were you doing there?” I told him I was a Christian missionary and I was going to see Mary on a mission visit. He said “How do you know her? Do you know that she’s wanted?” I knew she was on probation but I didn’t know she was wanted. My heart sank at the thought that this woman who had been working on turning her life around might have committed another crime. He kept questioning me. I felt totally powerless. I couldn’t get anywhere or talk to anyone. They could have easily taken me away. I’d never been so intimidated accused disrespected and completely unable to defend myself. The angry questioning went on for a while and finally the marshals decided that my story was legitimate and I couldn’t help them find Mary so they both left. I was surprised by how shaken and confused I was by the experience. I still didn’t know what had happened or why it had happened to me.  The house the missionary men live in which houses the main kitchen dining room and meeting room for all the missionaries. That evening we had a prayer meeting at our house. Afterwards some of the sisters were praying over one another. I still felt pretty shaken so I decided to ask for prayers. When they started praying over me one of the neighborhood women Tyresha got a word from the Lord. She said “God wants you to know what it’s like.” After she spoke her word I remembered that Tyresha had been in jail. She had spent some years in prison. God was allowing me some share in our neighbors’ experience of life. Later on Mary found out what had happened to me. She told me that when I knocked on her door she was in the waiting room at the probation office hoping to explain her plan for catching up on her probation payments. She hadn’t committed any new crimes and it really didn’t make any sense that they would have sent the marshals after her: she’d been sitting right in their office for hours! I think there’s something of the Incarnation in these experiences. Jesus already knows what it’s like to live in these houses to be one of the neighbors to experience fear sleepless nights and disrespect. He’s letting us feel what he feels which is what our neighbors feel. I thank God for giving me some share in the experience of our neighbors’ lives. He’s given me a gift. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
20190107091121,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6060,Sept. 6 2017 11:01 a.m.,Raining Buckets on Greenlawn's Gym Floor,Some of the varsity boys basketball players from Trinity School at Greenlawn got in a little summer practice time on the new parquet floor. by Sean Connolly Photos: Margaret Anderson John Kurdelak Trinity School at Greenlawn’s athletic center gym floor was destroyed by a flood late last summer. As planning for a new floor began Mike Gionfriddo the athletic director championed the idea of using a parquet pattern. He had in mind the famous floor designed in 1946 for the old Boston Garden where Larry Bird—a basketball legend who grew up in Indiana—once swished his shots. For Greenlawn’s new floor Mike hoped for a unique look for something with “a wow factor a nice pop.” Standing on that new floor today you can see the colors popping. Thousands of maple boards their hues ranging from dark to nearly blonde catch the light and gleam like the glazed tiles of a mosaic. Each about an inch wide the boards are arranged in 3’ by 3’ sections. The direction of the boards changes from one section to the next creating the same kind of checkerboard look that the old Garden had. Throw in the painted green stripes that adorn Trinity’s new floor and the visual similarity is unmistakable. (This surely raises a question in the minds of Greenlawn sports fans: If you build it. . . will the next Larry come?) This beautiful court would not have been possible without the generosity of more than 200 Greenlawn parents alumni friends and community members who rallied like a championship team after a big loss. “The court is a huge gift from the Lord” said John Lee Greenlawn’s head of school. “I want people to know how grateful we are to everyone who participated in the fundraising effort.”* * *As 7.65 inches of water descended on South Bend on August 16 2016 city streets became like swift-running rivers. Basements filled up like swimming pools and chickens drowned. No one saw what happened that night at the branch’s community center a modest facility that is also the athletic center for Trinity Greenlawn. The most likely story is that a torrent of water formed in a neighborhood to the north then surged through a culvert that runs below the Indiana Toll Road. The water swamped a retention pond then swept across the center’s parking lot and through the building’s lower level like a mighty tide.  Several inches of rainwater caused the old floor to buckle. The next morning Paul Barrett the facilities manager found sopping carpet on the indoor soccer field and half an inch to an inch of water on the gym floor. On the exterior walls he noticed a waterline between six and eight inches high. Then on a grassy area south of the building he found thousands of small fish even one six-inch bluegill deposited there by the wave of water. “I was almost in shock” he said. A contractor arrived later that day with heaters blowers and dehumidifiers hoping to save the gym floor. But within a few days the floorboards had swelled unglued themselves and buckled forming a series of wooden waves. In the soccer arena the carpet had to be cut up and thrown away. The contractor did manage to dry out the branch center’s first floor and keep mildew from growing. Leaders at the school and in the South Bend branch soon learned that the building’s general insurance did not cover flood damage and there was no flood insurance since the building does not lie in a flood plain. At Trinity John Lee and John Kurdelak the school’s director of advancement had already planned a fall fundraiser to raise $200000 for scholarships that Greenlawn families count on to help pay for tuition. To pay for a new floor they estimated they would need to raise an additional $150000. “We’ve never had to raise that much money in a single year” John Lee said. The need for the floor became even more obvious once the basketball season began. Mike Gionfriddo had succeeded in securing four practice times each week at the gym of Stanley Clark a local private school and in scheduling home games at another gym owned by the Salvation Army. Between the extra driving and the lack of a home court morale took a hit. “It was like all games were away games” said Eli Thomas a junior on the varsity team. A big breakthrough came in February when the Community Foundation of St. Joseph County announced that it would hold a Give Local Day on May 9. On that day 67 local nonprofit organizations would run simultaneous fundraisers as well as compete for money from a pool of matching funds the foundation offered. The rules state that 25% of the money raised by each organization must remain in an endowment fund held by the Community Foundation for that organization. This meant the school needed to increase its goal from $150000 to $200000. John Kurdelak began talking to his contacts including a friend of Trinity School who offered to give $100000 in matching funds. The donor chose to remain anonymous. “It was a very humble a very generous gift” John Kurdelak said. “We are extremely grateful.” The matching gift created more momentum for the project and John and his team worked intensely to get the word out. On May 9 the gifts came pouring in: $119000 from Greenlawn’s families alumni friends and community members plus the $100000 from the anonymous benefactor. Later the Community Foundation kicked in an additional $80632 in matching funds bringing Greenlawn’s overall total to nearly $300000. “It was easily the most the school has ever received through a single giving event” John Kurdelak said.* * *The search for a vendor to install the new floor began and Connor Sports one of the nation’s leading installers was already in the area working to install floors at Notre Dame. The company submitted a competitive bid and won the contract. Bruce Haroldson who has put in floors for the Olympics and for the Final Four college basketball championships came to put in the parquet floor for Greenlawn.  The adjustable goals provide fans more space to walk around the court. In addition to the floor six new adjustable basketball goals now hang from the ceiling. Two teams can practice on the court simultaneously and fans have more space to walk from the entryway to the bleachers. Trinity still has some money left over which will be used to pay for a study that will examine the best way to improve the soccer arena. A plan is also in the works to prevent future flooding. “We’re going to make physical changes to ensure that this kind of damage doesn’t happen again” said Mike Zusi who leads the community’s property office. “And we now have flood insurance.” So when the school year starts Greenlawn basketball players will be doing their best Larry Bird impersonations swishing shots on their new court. In basketball lingo that means it will be raining buckets. It’s a good thing we have flood insurance.
20190107091221,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5737,March 24 2017 1:02 p.m.,My Hope for This Neighborhood,Netesha Mosley by Netesha Mosley Photos: Mary Timler Editor’s note: Netesha Mosley and her husband Savoria met the People of Praise missionaries in 2010 and have been involved in our mission work in Evansville ever since. In 2011 the Mosleys and their children moved to the South Side neighborhood where Netesha grew up. A prophetic word Savoria gave and Netesha’s encouragement were both significant factors in the missionaries’ decision to move to the South Side in 2012 focusing their work there. In this article Netesha shares her life story and some of her thoughts on what God is doing in Evansville. My hope for this neighborhood is for it to get back to the way it was when I grew up here. We used to do all kinds of things— making mud pies and climbing trees and playing dolls and sports. Parents watched out for each other’s children. If we acted up on Jefferson Street by the time we got home my parents knew that we had acted up. We would have Vacation Bible School in the summertime and the churches had choirs. We went to church every Sunday. As I got older we stopped doing that. My home life got horrible. There was a church right down the street and if it got bad at home I would go there and sit. It was a place of peace. After I was 17 or 18 I started drinking and smoking. I would be at my friend’s house and we’d do all that stuff and then I’d come home and think I don’t want to live like this. It seemed like everybody else was happy but me. I felt so alone. I met Savoria at my friend’s house. He was reading the Bible one time and I asked him “How do you read the Word?” Because I had tried but of course I had started with Genesis. He said “I ask God to show me what I should read and bless me with understanding.” That was a stepping stone for me. At that point I cut off everybody and I just started reading my Bible. I would go to school go to work come home and read. One day I was walking down the street and the Lord said turn here. So I turned and I saw a church sign and it was so bright. I checked out what time the service was and I went. After that I was gung-ho. When the Lord saved me my whole world changed. Savoria and I got married in 2001. We had decided we were going to try and have kids. We tried but we were having trouble conceiving. The doctor said “We’re going to have you go through surgery.” I was young and newly married. All of this was freaking me out. Then the doctor told me “You can’t have kids.” So I got home and I was just bawling. I stood at my back door and I was like God I don’t know what’s wrong but you can heal it. And it was almost like I could feel it. After that I was pregnant.  Savoria and Netesha and their children have been supporters of the missionaries in Evansville from the start. At that point I still considered myself a baby in Christ. I had seen some people around me who went to church but then they were still doing other stuff. I felt abnormal. I didn’t want to go out to the club I wanted to stay home with my kids and do what God wanted me to do. Also some people at church would talk bad about other Christian denominations. I’m like We all love the Lord. We should be praying for each other. So we went from church to church. In 2010 when we lived on Kerth Street I came outside. It was a pretty day but I was like Man I don’t have anybody to talk to. I felt like I was in that same position as before—alone. I said “Lord I want to live for you but I also want to have relationships. I want to be around people that want to live for you.” I was looking at the block and thought What would it be like to live with a whole block of people who serve the Lord? My vision was a block of nice houses with white picket fences. People would take care of homes and of each other. When you came onto the block you would feel the presence of the Lord. It was almost like the block was illuminated  that’s how beautiful it was. And I said “Lord I want that.” A few months later we met the People of Praise. The first thing I noticed was that the missionaries were from different denominations but were living in unity. I would do my studies in the Word and God would give me something and then when they’d come they’d share a word from the Lord and it would be the same! Wow. Knowing the missionaries has helped me grow. First I learned about the vision of community then about being a wife and mother in the Lord. Sharing about moments when we felt close to Christ in women’s group has helped us be more open about the Lord within our family. The People of Praise helped me to recognize when God is speaking. Women’s group has helped me to look at things differently and not just think Oh here comes another trial but Yes! We gonna make it through this! It has helped me to have real relationships actually being there for each other to help each other when it seems like the enemy’s attacking. The woman touching the hem of Jesus’ garment that’s how women’s group is for me.  Netesha and her women’s group canned applesauce together last fall. From left: Ellen Reed Netesha Cindy Sullivan Abby Earhart and Jewel a friendly local canning expert. In 2011 Savoria told me we were gonna move to Jefferson on the South Side. “Really?” I said. A lot of the people we grew up with they’d moved so it wasn’t the same. The crime was worse. And it was scary because it could be 10:00 at night and we’d hear gunshots and I’m like Kids get on the floor! I would have to catch the bus home and my son would see all these people standing out there and smoking on the corner. It was so sad I felt bad for them. And I’m like Lord what is going on? I didn’t want to live here. Then when the missionaries said “We’re looking to come to the South Side” I’m like Thank you Jesus! This is what you want for this neighborhood. You want peace. And a lot of people want it but they don’t know how to obtain it. When the missionaries came here it was just like this is how you do it. It was like a blueprint on how to live for the Lord. A lot of the kids here they need to know what love is actual love. It seems like the peer pressure to do bad is so overwhelming for them. My son is 12 and he goes to Washington Middle School. He says “Mom they’re calling me whack” because a lot of his peers are smoking marijuana. “Son you’re not whack” I tell him. “Marijuana is an addiction that clouds your mind. That’s how the enemy works. He wants you to fail.” And I tell him to forgive when they hurt him. I say “Son you don’t know what they are going through. But pray for them because you might be the only person praying for them.”  Netesha and her daughter show off the shower gift she received from the missionary women upon the birth of her son. Kids absorb everything around them. If you sow hatred then that’s what they’re going to give out. But if you start showing them love it might happen years later but that seed is sown. That’s what I teach my kids. I really believe that the core of what the Lord is doing in this neighborhood is dealing with children spending time with them and letting them be children. I’ve heard of kids quoting the Bible to their parents and how it touches their mom or their dad. I’ve seen the neighborhood change drastically. I mainly look at kids. You can see them change. At the ice cream parties I saw the kids having so much fun–hula-hooping jumping rope. It was just so beautiful. It’s like the Lord breathed some life into the neighborhood. It’s alive again.

(Singing the camp theme song “Soul on Fire” must’ve kept them warm!) The campers enjoyed swimming tower-climbing zip-lining a ropes course riflery boating fishing soccer crafts and archery. Seven children came from Our Lady of Black Rock a Catholic school located in the neighborhood where the branch has an outreach. Some friends of the school helped pay for their camp fees. The children from Black Rock had so much fun they all made sure to show up families in tow at the following week’s Black Rock prayer meeting wearing their camp t-shirts and singing camp songs for a special reunion sponsored by the branch.

Four sets of fathers and sons not in the community attended. There were also 13 local boys who attended without their fathers some of whom are being raised by single mothers. “For at least the third year now we have asked the local house of the Missionaries of Charity to suggest some boys from their rough neighborhood who would benefit from such an event” Joseph Mutidjo said. Kevin Rodriguez added that the goal of the campout is “to provide the opportunity for boys and young men to spend time with positive role models whether their fathers or men in the People of Praise.”   A Saturday morning tradition at camp: calisthenics led by Locksley Robinson.  Five young men associated with the Missionaries of Charity (pictured with branch member Kevin Rowe and two other boys) came to camp this year.  A marl quarry captured the boys’ interest during the Saturday morning hike.  Campers celebrated the opening of the Lord’s Day.  New Generations camp provided the tents.

Rich imagined a different kind of soccer experience one where children of different ages played in a single location where the focus was on fun and learning rather than on winning games an experience that would harmonize with community and family life. He credits Katy McShane a covenanted sister who died in 2010 with helping him get the program off the ground.  This year 26 adults and teenagers coached around 40 boys and girls grades K-6 two times a week during the month-long program. Third-grader Justin Heintzelman says “I really like scrimmaging even when it’s difficult like when I have to play against my older brother Josh!”    Boys and girls appreciate the individual attention they get from the coaches as well as the shorter-than-normal fields.

Peter Smith (Vancouver-Portland) to be the auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland Oregon. The appointment was announced in Portland at 9:30 a.m. Pacific time on Tuesday March 4. Fr. Peter follows Bishop Kenneth Steiner who retired in 2011.Peter has been a member of the Brotherhood of the People of Praise since 1983. He has served the Archdiocese of Portland as the vicar general and moderator of the clergy since July 1 2013. His ordination as bishop is tentatively scheduled for April 29 2014.“Peter is a pastor who turns people’s minds and hearts to Jesus in his homilies” according to Joel Kibler who heads the Brotherhood and has been Peter’s friend for almost 30 years. “He prays with people for physical healing and he helps people to reconcile with the Lord. He has a great sense of humor and he is always dependable.”Peter says “I am humbled and grateful for the Holy Father's confidence in me. Please keep me in your prayers as I step in to this new role with all its responsibilities and challenges.  Pray especially for God the Father's blessing and protection.""Peter Smith was born in 1958 in Pietermaritzburg South Africa. He is the oldest of six children. At age 18 he served in the South African army before earning degrees in business and law from the University of Natal. In a biographical article he wrote for the book A Priest’s Life he says that he had expected to join his father’s law firm until he heard the Lord calling him to explore Christian community in the United States.  “I didn’t know it then but I was to spend only nine months in the next 26 years back in my homeland” he wrote.Kevin Ranaghan met Peter in South Africa in 1981. “I could see how deeply committed he was to the Lord and to the Church. I sensed that he was a young man seeking to serve and equipped with many gifts for service.”Peter joined the People of Praise in South Bend Indiana in 1983. He was ordained a priest in 2001 at age 43. In 2006 he earned a licentiate degree in canon law (J.C.L.) from the Catholic University of America. He served as pastor of St. Rose of Lima parish in Portland from 2006 to 2013.The Brotherhood of the People of Praise was established as a Private Association of the Faithful in the Catholic Church in 1999 by former Portland Archbishop John Vlazny following years of work by Joel Fr. Perron Auve (Vancouver-Portland) and others. This grant of juridical status paved the way for members of the Brotherhood to be ordained as Catholic priests while remaining members of the Brotherhood and members of the People of Praise. Joel notes that the Brotherhood is an ecumenical association according to its statutes though all of its current members are Roman Catholics. Following his ordination as bishop Peter will continue to live in the Brotherhood house in north Portland.“This is terrific news for our brother Peter” said Craig Lent the overall coordinator of the People of Praise. “I know I can speak for the whole community in expressing my heartfelt congratulations. I am delighted that Peter can serve the Catholic Church in this new way.”"
20190212223012,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work! Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”
20190212223346,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6126,Nov. 3 2017 12:38 p.m.,The Three Last Words of Bill Kenney,Bill worked as a security guard at Visitation School for 17 years.. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Courtesy of Dorothy Kenney; Anne Kane; Robert Cunningham Photoresource. On a frigid Wednesday last December hundreds gathered for a funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul packing the center section of one of the largest churches in the United States. Some circled the downtown blocks near the cathedral looking for parking and eventually gave up and went home.Outside the mailman asked at the rectory what was going on and the hired motorcycle escort asked the funeral director how he’d gotten such a large event. As the gospel was read a man wearing a bandanna and carrying a backpack came in the side door and walked across the front of the cathedral. On a day with a high temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind chill well below zero he wore sandals with white socks and white pants. While the crowd stood in their pews he walked right up to the casket at the front of the church bent down and kissed it. Then he walked down the center aisle and out the door. Later as the casket was carried out of the cathedral 12th-grade girls from Visitation School wearing white gloves teared up as they lined the aisle. The school declared a day off in his honor. Who was this man loved by so many? He was a security guard. He was a realtor who had once fallen deeply into debt. He wasn’t a rich man or a famous personality. He was Bill Kenney and above all as his son Fr. Kevin Kenney explained in his homily at the cathedral he had three words that he wanted said at his funeral: “Jesus Jesus Jesus.”* * *In the early 1970s Bill Kenney was a hardworking husband and father in the throes of growing a small business. Kenney Realty had three offices in the Twin Cities and 40 licensed realtors. Bill put in long hours showing homes but he still found time to take his seven kids water-skiing. He bought a beautiful large home for his family near Lake Harriet in South Minneapolis. He loved to talk and meet new people he loved a good joke and he loved his wife Dorothy often bringing flowers home for her along with the groceries. He had learned his work ethic early. His father died when Bill was 16 and Bill had taken on two jobs to help support a family of 11 mostly younger siblings. His son Kevin recalls “From the minute we could walk we had to have a job of some sort oftentimes just in his real estate office. I remember as a little kid emptying wastebaskets and vacuuming and cleaning.”  Students at Visitation School lined up as an honor guard for his funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul. In the fall of 1973 Dorothy’s life changed when she decided to attend a weekend introduction to the charismatic renewal put on by their parish. At the retreat Anna Brombach a fellow mother Dorothy knew from church came over to pray with her. Dorothy remembers “I looked down and it wasn’t Anna’s hand taking mine. It was Jesus’ hand. I got home the next day and I was so on fire.” A full turkey dinner was Bill’s favorite thing to cook and he had one waiting for Dorothy when she came home from the retreat. As the kids started washing the dishes after the meal Bill and Dorothy went for a walk around Lake Harriet. Dorothy recalls “I’m jumping and dancing and I said ‘Would you ever go to a prayer meeting with me?’ He said ‘Oh Dorothy. You’ve always been joyful. What’s such a big deal about this? You go to the prayer meeting. I sure as heck don’t want to go.’” For two and a half years Dorothy went to the prayer meetings alone. Then in 1976 Jim Cahill caught Bill and Dorothy as they were leaving mass and mentioned that Bishop Lucker a friend of Bill’s would be at the prayer meeting that night. As Dorothy remembers Jim said “Bill why don’t you come?” and Bill said “Maybe I will.” “I nearly fainted away” Dorothy recalls. At the end of the prayer meeting that night Bill greeted Bishop Lucker. Says Dorothy “The bishop said ‘Bill Kenney! What are you doing here?’ Bill said ‘I don’t come to these things. My wife does’ and Bishop Lucker said ‘You come back five times and then decide if you’re ever going to come again.’ Well Bill obeyed him and he never stopped coming.”* * *Bill quickly became involved in the charismatic renewal attending conferences and praying with people. He and Dorothy joined the growing covenant community in the Twin Cities that would eventually become Servant Branch. Bill insisted that his teenage children attend charismatic conferences and all seven of them were eventually prayed with for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Bill started asking for the Lord’s help in the details of his life. Kevin recalls him praying over broken washing machines as well as his response to car troubles on a road trip. “I think the block cracked in the car. He says ‘We have to pray over it and it’ll get fixed.’ That was his faith.” Many of Bill’s friends recall him counting how many times priests mentioned the name “Jesus” in their Sunday homilies so that he could encourage them later to get their numbers up.  The Cathedral of St. Paul Bill’s parish and the site of his funeral. This shift in Bill’s focus impacted his business life too. By the late 1970s with the economy struggling it became clear that Kenney Realty was overextended. The company and therefore Bill as its owner had fallen hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt. Many years later Bill told the story to the Twin Cities Catholic charismatic renewal: “Because of my finances I decided I needed help. I received the Holy Spirit in my life and got serious about getting out of debt. I always made decisions to do things and then I asked God to bless it but now I was asking God’s opinion as to what I was doing.” Bill started referring to Kenney Realty as a Christian business and instituted an optional daily morning prayer at the office. In 1979 Bill brought in some community members with business experience to form a board of directors for Kenney Realty. Robert Regan who worked in investment counseling and served on the board recalls Bill asking for help with the administrative side of the business. “He was always gregarious a great salesman not as good as an administrator and manager or financial guy.” Good advice from brothers and a demand for houses that came from groups of brothers and sisters moving to the Twin Cities to join the community (from North Dakota Iowa and Washington) kept the business growing for a few years until another economic downturn in the early 1980s. Also in 1979 Bill and Dorothy began a process of downsizing that would continue into the 1990s. Dorothy remembers “To get out of debt he never filed for bankruptcy but he said ‘We have to sell the big house.’ “Dorothy loved their block because they were surrounded by at least eight other large community families and the Kenneys used their house to host morning prayer for the neighborhood but they left it behind for a smaller place on Minnehaha Parkway. Bill’s eye for real estate showed in the deal: the new house was more affordable but still in a lovely spot. Three years later Bill told Dorothy that they would need to sell the smaller house and rent something. To Bill’s surprise the first thing Dorothy asked about was curtains. “I said ‘If you rent a house you don’t want to put fancy curtains in there.’ Of all the crazy things for me to say but that’s what was on my heart at the time.” Soon after that Bill and Dorothy went to look at a condo at the Commodore an old converted hotel in St. Paul. The owner reported “We furnished the whole place and I just spent $10000 on window treatments.” They moved in and eventually bought the condo. Bill set up a small office downstairs where he kept Kenney Realty running as a smaller and smaller business until it finally disbanded in the 1990s when Bill went to work as a realtor for another firm.  Dorothy Kenney stands in front of a photo of herself and Bill on their wedding day two days after he returned from Korea. They were married 62 years. Finally in 1999 a confluence of events ended Bill’s remaining debt for good. Both a community member and a minister Bill had borrowed from separately decided to forgive him those large debts. A year or two earlier Bill and Dorothy had thought about selling the condo to move into a smaller apartment across the street from the Cathedral of St. Paul but it hadn’t sold. Then another apartment opened up in the same building so they put the condo on the market again and it sold for $20000 more than the original listing. Dorothy says “Bill always said ‘God dumped $20000 in my lap.’ So totally totally totally out of debt we started over.” Robert remembers “Bill had been living an upper-middle-class life and he made the transition to less money. He had to change dramatically. He made the transition just no problem at all. He trusted the Lord and never had a depressed day as far as I recall. The Lord let him down very gently step by step and gradually out of debt.” In the midst of all this Bill was busy for the Lord too. He was in Christians in Commerce. He was on the board of DeLaSalle High School his alma mater. He was chairman of the Catholic charismatic renewal in the Twin Cities. He and Dorothy joined the cathedral parish in St. Paul and Bill volunteered to run the men’s club pancake breakfasts. He was also constantly engaged in his favorite pastime talking to people about Jesus. Mark Lauer Bill’s head remembers going out to lunch with Bill. “He would get to know the waiter or waitress by name and a little bit about the person’s story. If any need came up he would say ‘I’ll pray for you.’” Bill and Robert played golf together regularly and sometimes they would pair off with a couple of golfers they didn’t know. Robert says “No matter who we were playing golf with Bill would somehow bring the Lord into the conversation: ‘Do you know the Lord? Are you going to church?’ A lot of people would say ‘I quit going 25 years ago.’ He’d tell them ‘You gotta get back in touch.’”* * *Around the year 2000 Bill took a newly created job as a security guard at Visitation School a Catholic school of about 600 students in Mendota Heights. Visitation starts with pre-K and the older students in grades six to twelve are all girls. Bill arrived in the afternoons and stayed to close the building at night watching the security cameras greeting visitors and walking the last few girls to their cars after dark. He discovered that the parking lot was a little chaotic in the afternoon with students crossing the street at the same time that vehicles needed to leave so he started coming in earlier to direct traffic sometimes in a funny winter hat.  A blanket from Visitation sits on Bill’s favorite recliner. Rene Gavic the head of school at Visitation remembers “He was the go-to person. He knew everything. He had keys for everything. He was a good problem-solver so if someone’s car wouldn’t start they would go to Bill first. He cared about you and would help you and support you in any way.” Bill noticed when the students were having difficulties. Mary McClure who teaches religion at Visitation recalls “He would ask ‘Would you like me to pray with you?’ He waited until he knew there was an opening. Sometimes girls would share a healing: they needed to run and they’d had an injury so Bill prayed and they were able to participate the next day.” Rene adds a story about her own daughter at Visitation. “When she was 12 she fell in a cross-country race and other runners stepped on her face with their spiked shoes. She needed 22 stitches in her face. As a 12-year-old girl that was challenging for her. I remember her coming to school the very first day back and what she wanted to do was have Mr. Kenney pray with her. He prayed with her and her situation and her self-image–all of that–never bothered her again.” At Visitation Bill developed a strategy for generosity. Once a month the students give one dollar to charity for permission to be out of uniform for the day. Bill dropped by the campus minister’s office on the day she collected the dollars and exchanged larger bills for her pile of ones. “In one of his pockets he had a little vial of oil to pray with people and in the other pocket he had maybe twenty single ones. That would be for the kids whose dollar got stuck in the vending machines” Mary remembers. Those ones also often made their way into the hands of the homeless.  Bill as St. Nicholas at his church in 2015. There’s no way to know for sure if the man who kissed his casket at the funeral knew Bill but we can be quite sure that Bill would have cared about him if he had ever met him on the street. In his later years Bill’s friends remember him always going up to homeless people standing on corners telling them that Jesus loved them and giving them one or two dollars for a cup of coffee. That human contact was important to him. Bill’s son Kevin adds that he would also offer a dollar or two when someone at the grocery store didn’t have enough to pay. “I think it was because people had helped him when he was in a time of need. It became a way of life for him” Kevin recalls.* * *On December 4 2016 Bill stayed after church at the cathedral to play St. Nicholas for the children while Dorothy went home. As he was leaving he fell on the sidewalk outside and a passerby called 911. He’d had a stroke and died within a few days. For Christmas Dorothy and the Kenney family gathered at the home of one of her daughters. Bill had dressed as Santa Claus for many years and Santa Claus wasn’t there that year. Dorothy’s kids coaxed her to the front door of the house. Dorothy recalls “Out the front door they had all these jars with candles in them spelling out ‘Jesus’ on the front lawn. It was so beautiful because Bill preached Jesus. I mean he preached Jesus preached preached Jesus.”

They go out in groups of two or three wearing masks and carrying hand sanitizer. They knock on doors and ask simply “how are you doing?” What they’ve found is that many people are willing to talk—more people than in the past. Many are lonely. Some have other needs: for food for jobs for something for the kids to do for medicines and other errands needs around the house the yard and so on. The missionaries have been doing what they can to help dropping off food pulling weeds talking with children running errands for neighbors and always praying. As other neighbors and friends find out about what the missionaries are doing they’ve been getting in on the action—giving the missionaries food and money to distribute. Our missionaries are becoming a conduit for love and service.  This kind of personal visiting going out to our neighbors and checking in is something many of us can do. In a certain sense all you have to do is walk out your front door and encounter your neighbor. The biggest obstacles may be on the inside where the devil sows fear and doubt but Jesus gives us the strength to overcome temptations. We wanted to share this information with you to encourage and inspire you to go out and meet Christ in your neighbors. Christ is suffering now in so many ways. As one spiritual writer put it “We do truly comfort Him most when recognizing Him in our neighbor we serve and love our neighbor for the love of Him.” As you give this a try in your own neighborhood please send us your own stories of how you are finding Christ in your neighbors. Let’s make this a summer of service!
20200920040247,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8012,July 15 2020 10:33 a.m.,A School Year Like No Other,The Greenlawn campus set up for the commencement celebration. Photo by Tess Cassady. By Catherine Bulger with reporting by Kathryn Elliott On a muggy Friday evening in early June Trinity School at Greenlawn faculty members welcomed carloads of graduating seniors and their families onto campus directing them to parking spots along the long lane that runs through the property. Rows of balloon-festooned signs bearing seniors’ names decked the lawn flanking a small tent with a speaker’s lectern. A ring of carefully spaced chairs held faculty and staff. With everyone in place Greenlawn’s first outdoor commencement ceremony commenced.  Two Graduate Award winners gave an opening prayer and a valedictory (the Graduate Award is Trinity School’s highest award). Then each cap-and-gowned senior walked from the cars to stand next to his or her sign. Head of School John Lee closed the condensed ceremony with a brief address. Each senior received gifts prepared by the faculty: a personalized coffee mug a bound booklet of the traditional faculty honorings. a copy of James Joyce’s The Dead and a makeshift diploma because the real ones weren’t available yet—the company that makes them had been closed due to the coronavirus. Meadow View faculty send off the newly graduated class of 2020. Photo by Caren Louise Photographs. In Virginia local officials changed the regulations the day before Trinity School at Meadow View’s commencement allowing for outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people. Capitalizing on this freedom the seniors sat outside six feet apart with their families remaining in their parked cars. There was no commencement speaker because the event came together so quickly but the school decided to present three Graduate Awards instead of the usual two and each recipient gave an address. The graduating seniors walked across the outdoor stage to receive their diplomas. As the seniors departed other students lined the road in their cars to honk them out into the world.  Steve Hendrickson and Beth Schmitz preside over River Ridge's parking lot graduation. Photo by Bob Cunningham. At Trinity School at River Ridge the seniors received their diplomas in drive-through fashion as they entered campus. Seniors families and faculty positioned their cars throughout the large parking lot and stayed inside them for the ceremony. A radio transmitter broadcast the proceedings to all the parked cars. Car horns blared joyfully. Graduates poked their heads out of sunroofs to talk to their classmates. Dr. David Odde a biochemist at the University of Minnesota gave a commencement address. When the new graduates departed the faculty lined their cars into a triumphal corridor for them to pass through. “A lot of the graduates sat on top of cars myself included” said River Ridge senior Abby Theis. “We were able to take off our hats and wave them around.” “We joked about our senior gift being a giant hand sanitizer bottle that said ‘In memory of the class of 2020.’”*** Distance learning at Trinity began in mid-March. When it became clear that the rest of the semester would be held off campus conversations began about how to manage the end of the school year with its numerous traditions and activities and above all graduation. The three heads of school and the deans consulted the seniors and their parents.“They gave us a couple of options. We can do graduation next year or do it in August and a lot of people didn’t like either of these ideas” said Greenlawn senior Julia Zusi. In the end all three schools settled on their variation of an outdoor commencement in June.  Faculty members welcome graduating seniors and family to Greenlawn's campus. Photo by Tess Cassady. Normally Trinity hosts a dinner the night before commencement for faculty seniors and parents. Each senior is individually honored by one of the teachers. River Ridge Head of School Beth Schmitz said “One of the things seniors and parents expressed was really wanting to hear their classmates honored.” So instead of a dinner together River Ridge moved the honorings to a Zoom gathering. Another popular tradition near the end of the term at Trinity is morning prayer sharings given by the seniors. River Ridge was able to move those online as well. At Greenlawn the seniors wrote their sharings and recorded themselves giving them and they were sent to the student body in an email. Meadow View created a webpage to host the spring fine arts events that normally populate May evenings at Trinity. The website featured recordings of ninth- and tenth-grade musical compositions dramatic monologues by the senior drama students photos of senior artwork and a virtual choir produced by the music teacher.  Meadow View faculty delivered gift boxes to the graduating seniors at their homes. Photo courtesy of TSMV. Because the second senior drama production was cancelled Greenlawn decided to broadcast two readers’ theaters as Zoom video recordings that premiered on YouTube with each actor reading his or her part from home. To replace the Greenlawn spring fine arts night the two art teachers compiled a slideshow of all the eighth-grade and senior artwork. At River Ridge three long-serving faculty members retired: Penny Arndt Debby Salmon and Mary Radtke. Among them they have over 70 years of teaching experience at Trinity School. Penny has been dean of girls since the school began in 1987. Beth says it was very hard not to be able to honor them in person but they were able to celebrate the teachers at a virtual end-of-year ceremony on the last day of class. Likewise Greenlawn had two retiring faculty members to honor: Marge Connolly a long-time Humane Letters Seminar teacher and Tom Finke who helped found the school and served as its head from 1981-83 then again from 2002-04 and is moving from teaching to administration. The faculty honored them at a lunch (with tables spaced out for social distancing) the week after school ended.***All the end-of-year celebrations and activities happened on top of the many weeks of pivoting the normal Trinity spring curriculum to an online scaled-back format. John said “The instinct among the faculty was to achieve everything we normally achieve which was great and admirable but also impossible.” Most classes met online via Zoom two or three times a week (instead of daily) for about half the usual amount of class time per day. Teachers and students all needed to learn the technology. Ramping up the pressure some students were sharing computers with siblings and with parents working from home. The school decided to make courses pass/fail and cut back on the normal workload. Julia described her typical day. “I started with personal morning prayer worked out for an hour and then started schoolwork or had class. I would pace while I was reading or jump on the trampoline for 10 minutes in between subjects. Having classes and having morning prayer planned out helped me have a real schedule which was a struggle for the first three weeks.” She added “Most of the senior girls were working six to eight hours a day most of it on the computer. I sometimes get minor migraines that are light-induced so the screen time was hard for me but there’s a nightlight feature that filters out a certain kind of light that bothers people’s eyes.”  A Meadow View student performs a frog dissection from home with classmates on Zoom. Photo courtesy of TSMV. The teachers had to adapt their teaching styles dramatically. Lynda Seasly who teaches girls’ math at Greenlawn learned how to use an iPad so she could do problems in real time on the screen for her students. Mary Radtke who taught Scripture (among other things) at River Ridge would put reflection questions in the Google Classroom group chat. At Meadow View Tim Dusenbury recorded himself reading several chapters of Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov out loud for his students to follow along. Marge Connolly learned how to record short videos and upload them to YouTube so that she could explain difficult terms and concepts without wasting precious minutes of class time. Maintaining motivation to get schoolwork done alone at home was another challenge. Ben Bagiackas a Greenlawn senior said “Because the classes were pass/fail it was much more the guys in my class holding one another to a higher standard. We told each other to put in the effort for the sake of the effort.” Meadow View Head of School Kay Yohe commented “I was very proud of the extent the students kept up with really rigorous material when it was pass/fail. The vast majority of them really hung in there.” “Some subjects got harder” said Joe Whelpley a sophomore at Meadow View. “The new concepts in precalculus were difficult like inequality in matrices. Setting it up was harder because we couldn’t do it on our calculators together. You can’t really troubleshoot a friend’s calculator inputs on Zoom.” On the other hand he added “Chemistry was pretty unchanged. Other classes like Latin and New Testament were unchanged. They’re either translation or reading.” But Joe added that the hardest part of distance learning was missing classmates. “The best part about school—that was taken away from us—was the camaraderie. Seeing them on Zoom was not enough. We would text and say ‘I miss you guys.’ We would try to call one another but it can be hard to coordinate.”  Avy Flory a junior from Meadow View won the competition at The Dailies to recreate a famous work of art. Avy recreated a self portrait by Frida Kahlo. Abby agreed. “We had a goose chase (scavenger hunt) where we had to take pictures and send them in and we were in teams and that really helped. But other than that I didn’t get to see my friends much outside of class and that was hard. Not being able to talk to our teachers or the students was just really difficult.” Trinity Schools President Jon Balsbaugh led the charge in formulating distance learning throughout the difficult months striving to improve the experience. Among other things he created The Dailies—a cross-campus forum to share art music poetry and competitions such as kite-flying and Rube Goldberg competitions. The Dailies’ purpose was purely fun and love of learning. In a letter to the students explaining The Dailies Jon wrote “I encourage you to take time during the day especially to appreciate and respond to beauty. Read the poems and take them to heart. Don’t just glance at the artworks interact with them. And go to a quiet place close your eyes and listen to the pieces of music. Beauty will not be rushed.” “It was a really nice chance to have something that’s not in my normal curriculum” said Maggie Kocon a ninth-grader at River Ridge. “I got a taste of what younger and older students are thinking across all the Trinity Schools.”***There’s no denying distance learning was hard on students and faculty and parents alike. “Everybody’s tired and beat up” said John Lee. “I think people were more mentally and psychologically tired—more mental energy gets used up to keep focus in a way that’s not necessary when you’re rubbing up against people day to day.” Beth Schmitz added “One thing distance learning did was cast a spotlight on things we take for granted every day like 30-second conversations and just being together.”  River Ridge graduating seniors celebrate atop their cars. Photo by Bob Cunningham. Julia reflected “You go through all the grades thinking about what your last day will look like. Our class never had a field day [as seniors] because fall field day was also cancelled. It was really disappointing. But we still had really good Humane Letters conversations. We still had a final math project and figured out how to make small groups work together. I think [the school] did a good job of making sure we were able to still do all the big things.” Abby added “I’m not sure I would want to do it again but there was a lot of beauty in it.” “I saw the Lord in my students suffering” Marge Connolly said. “And it was a real suffering for them especially the seniors—what they had to give up and lay aside which was really important to them.” All of that may explain why there was such a release of joy as students faculty and parents gathered together in parking lots and on the lawn to celebrate the seniors and their completion of a Trinity School education to celebrate the completion of several months of a Trinity School education as it has never been done before.

They are continuing to turn vacant city lots--and their own backyards--into gardens to grow produce for their neighbors. This year Praise Harvest aims to grow over 4000 pounds of greens alone as well as much more.
20200920040259,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8182,Sept. 18 2020 4:07 p.m.,Mobile Dodges Bullet from Hurricane Sally,"Neighbor's tree lands on Mary Ellen Naylor's house. by Catherine Bulger Hurricane Sally blew through Mobile Alabama on Wednesday. Though most branch members lost power and many of their properties sustained minor damage—with fallen trees and shingles blown off brothers and sisters are praising God that everyone is safe. With a wind speed of 105 mph Sally made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane early Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores Alabama. Mobile is 40 miles northwest of Gulf Shores and sits at the north end of Mobile Bay which opens into the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately for Mobile the winds shifted slightly pushing water from Mobile Bay out towards the ocean instead of flooding the city.  The hurricane traveling at just two miles per hour stalled over the region for many hours. In Mobile lights began to flick out on Tuesday night and by Wednesday morning Alabama Power reported over 175000 customers without power in the area. Mobile ultimately received about five inches of rain and wind gusts of up to 82 mph according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile Orange Beach AL southeast of Mobile was deluged with nearly 30 inches as was Pensacola FL. “Mobile really dodged a bullet” said branch member Lydia Gaudet.   On Thursday after the storm had moved out and blue skies returned schools and many businesses remained closed. Majestic live oak trees lay uprooted in a historic town square. Myriad crews raced to restore power as quickly as possible and clear the streets of debris. The city imposed an overnight curfew to facilitate cleanup work.   Fallen leaves litter Steve and Lydia Gaudet's street.  Walter and Julia Drey's broken balcony railing. Walter and Julia Drey live on Dog River close to the bay. Their home is raised seven feet off the ground but it has flooded in past storms. Julia reported “The wonderful thing is that the river did not rise. The North wind actually blew the water out of the river so that was a real blessing.” The Dreys did have driving rain seep into the living room through cracks in the doors. They hurried around with towels mopping up water. “We set the alarm at night for every two hours to go around and check the house” she said. A lot of shingles blew off the roof so Walter put a tarp over it to prevent leaking. In the middle of the night the balcony railing finally gave way to the tree that had been beating on it continuously. “We’ve got a lot of yard cleaning up to do” said Julia “but my basic attitude is I’m very grateful it wasn’t worse.”  Mary Ellen Naylor lives with her sister and her adult son daughter and son-in-law. They lost electricity at 10:30 pm on Tuesday. At 3:30 am they heard the crack of the neighbors’ large oak tree followed by the crash as its branches landed on their roof breaking through in four places. Mary Ellen’s son-in-law went out later and cleared away as much tree as he could without the use of his electric chainsaw. He managed to get a tarp over most of the holes for now. “The rain was torrential at times a lot of it happening after dark. Trees were really whipping around” said Mary Ellen.  Branches poking through Mary Ellen's roof into the attic. “The worst part of a hurricane is the heat afterward” said Rose Denton. Bill and Rose Denton also lost power Tuesday night. It was hard to sleep after that especially for Rose and her mother (who lives with the Dentons). Rose was still off work but on Thursday Bill had gone out to the non profit camp he works at and spent the whole day doing cleanup on the property. The Dentons lost the awning over their kitchen door and part of their privacy fence. The cable line was down in the backyard.  Tony and Phyllis Compretta were getting ready on Thursday to put some of their food in Manny and Donna Ganzarain’s freezer since the Ganzarains have a generator. “Our street did look messy” said Phyllis “but people started coming out yesterday and cleaning up yards. There’s a lot of loose shingles. We can’t tell where they came from.” The Comprettas didn’t lose any large trees but Phyllis was mourning the loss of several smaller ornamentals including her crepe myrtle. “There was a lot more wind intensity than we realized it was going to be” she said. “It just went on for hours and hours and hours. I’m glad it wasn’t any worse.”  Steve and Lydia Gaudet also have a generator so they had something of an open door on Thursday with neighbors and grown children coming over to put milk and eggs in the refrigerator make coffee and charge cell phones. One of their children borrowed the camping stove and propane. “When you live here” said Lydia “you keep that stuff around.” “We’re so grateful that everyone is safe and that the damage wasn’t greater” said Mike Coney who is the coordinator from the branch relations council responsible for Mobile. “Please pray for the clean up effort in Mobile and especially for those in Alabama and Florida who sustained major flooding."""

20200920040306,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=7791,June 5 2020 3:44 p.m.,Pentecost Praise and Worship,We’d like to share a few more Pentecost songs from some of our celebrations this past weekend.  In South Bend the branch’s music ministry prepared a virtual band and choir rendition of a few songs as part of a live streamed community meeting. The first song was “The Blessing” which has been sung by virtual choirs of Christians around the globe since the coronavirus pandemic began. By singing along you can join your voices with those of many brothers and sisters in Christ pronouncing a blessing on all people. (If you’d like to see the ecumenical and heartfelt UK Blessing again you can view it here.)    The second song was “Revive This Land” by Jared Gonzalez (Colorado Springs). The South Bend music ministry participants included Collin Anderson (choir) Anna Balsbaugh (choir for The Blessing) Thomas Brophy (choir for The Blessing) Annie Bulger (choir) Catherine Bulger (choir) Tom Finke (bongos) Elizabeth Grams (lead vocals) Larry Grauvogel (guitar) Emilie Grondin (bass and cello) Jim Grondin (soprano saxophone drums for Revive This Land) Joe Heintzelman (mandolin) Mark Hoover (choir) Frank Massa (drums for The Blessing) Tom Noe (tamborine forThe Blessing) Suzanne Thomas (choir) Ginny Timler (keyboard) and Mike Zusi (guitar and choir for The Blessing). Jim Grondin arranged the music for the group. Elizabeth Grams and Tom Zusi edited the audio.     In the Twin Cities the People of Praise was invited to participate in a Pentecost service sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. During the service a small crowd viewed a video of Jim Rolland and Chuck Fossen singing and playing “Send Your Rain” by Kelly Carpenter. The service was broadcast on Facebook and can be viewed here; to get to the video of Jim and Chuck scroll the playbar to 1:39:30 (about three quarters of the way through the service).  Lord pour out your Spirit upon our land!
20200920040313,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8155,Sept. 15 2020 4:28 p.m.,Wildfires Burn in Oregon and Washington,"By Sean Connolly Jim McDowell (Corvallis) recalls the weekends and summers he spent at a cabin his family built amid towering hemlock trees on the north fork of Oregon's Santiam River. Starting from age 12 he helped clear the land and learned to spot Chinook salmon in the river. Over time he came to treasure the cabin as ""a place where you can step away from the world and see God face to face in the quiet.”  The cabin is gone now—burned in the Beachie Creek Fire. Beachie Creek is one of several conflagrations that swept down from the Cascade Mountains towards the heavily populated Willamette Valley home to the community's Corvallis and Vancouver/Portland branches. Energized by high winds it destroyed several small towns and scorched 190000 acres. Closer to Portland the Riverside Fire has burned 134000 acres while the Holiday Farm Fire southeast of Corvallis has burned 166000 acres.   Jim McDowell's family cabin burned in the Beachie Creek Fire.

As of Monday in Oregon 10 people have died from the fires and 22 are reported missing according to the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. The winds have died down for now allowing firefighters a chance to contain the fires. Dry conditions persist but there is rain in the forecast this week. Corvallis itself after experiencing fiery-orange skies and ash falling like a light snow for several days last week is now shrouded in a dense grey fog. The closest fire is 45 or 50 miles away by road and the city is not in immediate danger. All branch members and their houses are safe and yet life is hardly normal. ""We haven't seen the sun in over a week"" Principal Branch Coordinator Phil Monaco noted on Monday morning. ""There are hardly any sounds. Everything is stopped.”  The skies over Corvallis Oregon last week. Photo by Phil Monaco. With their air quality registering in the ""hazardous"" to ""very unhealthy"" ranges according to a U.S. government website branch members are largely staying indoors with their windows closed. The city hasn't picked up the trash in more than a week. Parks are closed. Tom Melton runs a road paving business but can't pave any roads since the asphalt plants are shut down. Tim and Mary Jo Wagner welcomed their son and his young family from Salem Oregon into their home since the Wagners have a good air-filtration system. Geoff and Nancy Myers bought pet food and cleaning supplies and took them to a dropoff point for delivery to evacuees staying at the fairgrounds. Jean Monaco has four cousins who live outside Vida Oregon near the heart of the Holiday Farm Fire. Two lost their homes and she is waiting to hear about the home of a third cousin. Bryan Thompson and his family have been going for decades to a private campground called Taylor Park in Lyons Oregon. They rent a space and have access to it year-round. Bryan says they were there on Labor Day weekend and knew the Beachie Creek Fire was nearby but the winds normally blow to the east so they were not concerned. After they left the winds blew west. “We have heard that all the structures are completely burned” he said. Eighty miles north of Corvallis Portland currently has the worst air quality of any major city in the world according to a report in The New York Times. The closest large fire the Riverside Fire is about 30 miles southeast of downtown Portland. It’s not currently threatening Portland but that could change with a strong westerly wind.  A view of downtown Portland on Saturday September 12. Photo by Lena Glover. ""As soon as you get outside it smells like a campfire” says Principal Branch Coordinator Charlie Fraga. ""Kids can’t go outside and play. It’s tough.”  He adds “Just like with the pandemic people in Portland are adapting to the new situation. You have a smile on your face and you’re praising God all the while.”  As in Corvallis branch members keep their windows shut to keep out the bad air and ash. Kathy Bucheit spoke about sealing cracks with towels and blankets to keep out the ash and the acrid smell. Her nephew is a firefighter battling the fires in Clackamas County just east of Portland where the Riverside Fire is raging. Another nephew in Clackamas had to evacuate. She said she hasn’t gone outside for more than three days except briefly to check the mail. Sunday’s Vancouver-Portland branch meeting was supposed to be held outdoors in small groups but instead took place on Zoom. The meeting included a time of praise and a sharing from branch member Toby Clairmont an emergency preparedness expert on how to create a “go kit” in case branch members need to flee as well as conversation about reaching out to neighbors and intercessory prayer.  A view of the Kenton neighborhood in North Portland. Photo by Charlie Fraga. Similarly at the branch meeting in Corvallis “We spent a good part of our time praying for the fire victims and that the Lord just put the fires out and that we get rain. We really need rain” Phil said. They added prayers for an end to the pandemic for peace amid the social unrest in Portland and for a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit. At their house in Battle Ground Washington Toby Clairmont and his wife Susie have their truck and RV ready to go in case they need to evacuate. They are about 20 miles from the Big Hollow Fire which has burned 20000 acres. Toby leads a volunteer team of amateur radio operators who are ready to help communicate evacuation orders to those living in hard-to-reach rural areas.   Ten or so miles away Jeff Lindberg says he has been able to see the sun through the smoke. “It looks like a full moon.” He adds “It’s been a drag for the kids lately because they want to go outside and play. For the most part we say 'No you can’t' but we let them play a bit yesterday [Monday]. For his part after losing his family’s cabin Jim McDowell says “I can see good coming out of it in the sense that for my family my brothers and sisters there’s an opportunity to bring us all together."" Charlie adds “With danger all around us we’re so grateful to God for protecting us. We ask everyone for prayers for rain for the safety of ourselves and our neighbors for those who have already suffered tragic personal loss for all of the firefighters and for a swift end to the wildfires."""
20200920040317,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8139,Aug. 31 2020 3:54 p.m.,Three Elected to Board of Governors,"Three men were elected to the community's board of governors on August 29: Tom Caneff (Servant Branch) Nick Holovaty (Mission Division Evansville) and John Zwerneman (South Bend).  Each will serve a six-year term that begins on December 1 2020.

With their mom Kristin operating a camera their sister Gloria (16) helping set up and their dad Eric offering helpful suggestions the boys managed to create a remarkably long and complex chain reaction involving a lego spaceship on a string dominoes marbles trains a crossbow a flying hammer a pinewood derby car and ultimately a cell phone rigged to take a picture of the boys. (You have to see it to believe it!) The boys ended up taking over a large part of their basement and had to move furniture and other stored items out of the way. Gloria collected books from the Trinity curriculum to stack as supports for different parts of the track. “We did our first full test run on Wednesday night (April 22) but we didn't get very far” says Jacob. “After our schoolwork on Thursday we went back to work on it and finally got it to work all the way through at 11:30 pm. “One particularly difficult part to accomplish was getting the car to hit the train. Also getting to the part where the crowbar fell onto the crossbow and shot the ink cartridge and having it actually hit the target. That took a long time to get right!” The cross-campus competition is one part of Trinity’s efforts to use the sojourn into distance learning to the students’ benefit. As of early April the three Trinity campuses began to share an online collection of art poetry music math and science gathered by or created by its own faculty and students. It’s called The Dailies. “The Dailies is a place where students from all grades at all campuses have the chance to see poems of the day artwork of the day works of music contests and other enrichment activities. Comments are welcome but not required. There are no assignments. This is learning in its highest freest and purest sense” said Jon Balsbaugh the president of Trinity Schools. Trinity also hosts competitions through the site. The Rube Goldberg machine building contest was the first. As a prize the Heintzelman boys shared an Amazon gift card and a book entitled How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems. The second competition began yesterday and involves reproducing a famous piece of art.

""Arise shine for your light has come and the Glory of the Lord is rising on you.” (Isaiah 60:1 Servant Camp 2020 Scripture verse).  by Catherine Bulger It’s the first week of August. Hundreds of campers aged 7 to 18 eagerly reunite with friends they haven’t seen in months. Units march across dewy fields to the rhythm of time honored tunes. Campfires blaze in the evening illuminating conversations about Scripture and following Jesus. Counselors who attended camp as children return for their 12th or 15th or 20th year. Archery and bike trips and field games and crafts are in full swing. Servant Camp is here again.  Except it’s 2020 and the coronavirus pandemic still rages. So Servant Camp this year like so much else looks a little no a lot different.    Parking lot opening ceremony in Servant Branch. Photo by Andy Bowar. It’s at three locations instead of one: River Ridge campus in Eagan Minnesota the South Bend branch center and the branch center in Rockford. It’s a day camp rather than the usual five-day overnight affair. Attendance is smaller than usual though still substantial. Campers and staff alike wear masks and mostly stick to interacting with their own unit. Everything is carefully planned--from how to drop kids off to how to clean field equipment between groups. In Minnesota opening and closing ceremonies happen in a parking lot with sound fed via radio transmission to the cars.  222 campers and 77 staff in total attended Servant Camp 2020. Camper attendance in recent years has been about 325. The camp directors did what they could to help the separate locations feel unified including distributing craft materials and t-shirts creating a joint Instagram account and live streaming Minnesota’s opening and closing ceremonies. The camp created a packet of activities people unable to attend could do at home which they posted on their website.  Servant Camp has seen its share of challenges and changes since its inception in 1978. In 1997 longtime staff member George Simmons died at camp. There was a frightening canoe accident. Gail Lee director and wife of former overall director Carmen Lee (Servant Branch) died in 2009. Camp has changed location several times. In 2012 South Bend camp merged with Servant Branch’s Servant Camp to form one joint camp. There have been injuries and illness and heavy storms and tornado threats. So far camp has gone on.   Andy Grams who has designed every camp shirt since 2002 put together this poster of all the shirt designs up to 2017.  Servant Camp 2020 t-shirt. Photo by Colleen Couch. When it became clear that a normal Servant Camp would be impossible this year the directors who meet regularly all year started talking about possibilities. Overall camp director Pat Ficker (Servant Branch) said “We’d get together and pray and say Lord is there something we can do?” Gradually the idea of a day camp on our own properties in separate locations emerged.   Director Jeanne Oberg (Servant Branch) who has served as a counselor since 1981 and a director since 1988 (she says she’s missed one year) credited younger staff with encouraging camp to move forward despite the challenges. “I wanted to take a year off” she said. “My daughter Annie said ‘No Mom we can do this!’” Another young staffer Margaret Maruggi approached her with the idea of a shared Instagram account to keep the locations united.  Pat said that a focus became: how do we do a few things well? Each location settled on activities that they had staffing and capacity for.   Pool noodle tag. Photo by Tianzhi Chen.  6th grade girls bike trip in Minnesota. Photo by Andy Bowar.  ""Hand arts"" at River Ridge. Photo by Andy Bowar. In Servant Branch the units (different age groups of boys and girls) were split between morning afternoon and evening shifts. Younger groups (1st-7th grade) came in the morning and afternoon. Director Mike Oberg (Servant Branch) selected one unit each day for a flag raising ceremony. Jeanne would gather the staff before children arrived and teach them camp songs to sing that day. Pat said the girls in particular were always singing as they walked from place to place.  John Brickweg ran field games like soccer and big base and pool noodle tag (the better to social distance). Nadine Reinhardt (Servant Branch) per tradition led “hand arts” or arts and crafts. There was a traditional 6th grade bike trip through the city and a 7th grade visit to a climbing tower. In the evening 8th-12th graders came for games snacks and small group prayer and discussion around a campfire.   The South Bend 7th graders went to a ropes course. Photo by Stephen Busk.

South Bend held camp two mornings and evenings flanked by opening and closing ceremonies. Directors Beth Couch and Stephen Busk (South Bend) had the new responsibility of organizing all the local logistics themselves. Beth says “We realized it’s really nice to show up on the bus and everything’s planned. But everybody here really pulled in and helped out and was very flexible to where they could go serve.” South Bend’s camp included archery (taught by two local instructors one of whom is a Trinity parent and one who has trained Olympic archers) “camp crafts” (building fires and other camp skills) a bike trip a ropes course white water rafting and talks in the evening for older campers.   Gaga ball in Rockford.

The last morning they all went on a bike ride and went swimming in the afternoon. The high schoolers split their time between working with the younger campers and doing service projects. One group built a wheelchair ramp for a branch member’s neighbor. The older boys took a canoe trip and the older girls went hiking and kayaking at a local state park. Amy Newburn (Rockford) who helped lead the camp said that many branch members jumped in and helped however they could. She added that she thought the counselors in Rockford learned from observing both Servant Camp and Action camps over the years.   South Bend Ponies. Photo by Colleen Couch. The first and second graders known as the Ponies normally only come for a day camp. The Ponies were the largest group this year with about 15 in South Bend and 22 in Minnesota. Stephen Busk remarked that it was a blessing to have camp for the younger children in South Bend who wouldn’t normally travel to Minnesota for a day camp. “It makes me wonder if we should do this every year--have a local day camp for them” he said.    Older boys play ultimate frisbee in Minnesota.

All three locations had highs in the 70s low humidity cool breezes and not a drop of rain which reportedly may be a Servant Camp first. The evening attendees in Minnesota were treated to show stopping sunsets.  Pat said the weather was a gift from the Lord because the whole plan for camp was weather dependent. Heavy rain or storms or brutal heat would have threatened to cancel the day. Jeanne commented “I wanted something extravagant like renting a food truck or something outrageous. I think the weather was our extravagant thing.” The highlight was being together. Many of the children particularly the younger ones hadn’t seen many of their friends for months. The joy of seeing one another seemed to make up for all the parts of camp that were curtailed. Pat remarked “I thought what the Lord wanted this year was for the kids to be together and run and jump and play. And that was his miracle this year. You should have seen the eyes of these kids!”  Camp director Pat Ficker leads closing ceremonies. Photo by Tianzhi Chen."
20200922043338,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4747,June 11 2015 3:03 p.m.,Craig Lent Elected to Second Term as Overall Coordinator,The community’s board of governors elected Craig Lent to a second term as overall coordinator of the People of Praise on June 11.

20200924184030,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”

The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will.

(Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985).

20200926233427,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3290,Nov. 12 2013 3:06 p.m.,Into the Joy,Story by Sean Connolly photos by Margaret DeCelles video from Ellen Putzier Thomas Duddy raised his left hand in a gesture of praise as he and his bride Jeanette (Zimmel . . . until 45 minutes previously) walked briskly down the red-carpeted aisle of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Shreveport. Some 150 voices in the congregation—Hawaiian voices southern voices Minnesota voices Missionary voices New Orleans voices Shreveport voices Virginia voices a lone Portland voice (Fr. Chuck Wood’s) and children’s voices—rang out as one voice “Shout joyfully to God all the earth; sing to the glory of his name!” The ushers swung wide the front doors of the church to reveal a heavy rain hammering the pavement outside. Jeanette’s brother David Zimmel a groomsman trailed behind his sister and felt the panic as the procession neared the doors. Then as he recalls “Out of the mist stepped Nick Raway (Mission Division Shreveport) holding a giant umbrella. Then a neurosurgeon from the clinic where Jeanette works came from the other side carrying an umbrella from his car.” Thomas Jeanette and their wedding party continued through the rain but sheltered by umbrellas to the getaway car. The congregation sang on “Let them be jubilant full of his joy” and the joy soaked into the people as the rain saturated the ground outside. This was the third time Christians in Mission team members living in Allendale had married each other. Nathan and Genevieve (DeCelles) Barrett broke the ice in 2007 with Josh and Mary Claire (Busk) Caneff following them in 2012. But Thomas and Jeanette were the first to hold their wedding in Shreveport in a church just a stone’s throw from Allendale. This meant that neighbors could attend the festivities and that the festivities themselves could more obviously point to the greater missionary burden the Lord is calling the People of Praise to shoulder in Allendale. Even the wedding cake told a larger story. Its white top displayed a map of the Mississippi River Valley outlined in black icing with red dots indicating Indianapolis Evansville and Shreveport the sites of the community’s missions along with the words of a prayer “Let your glory fill the valley.” Choosing a Shreveport wedding meant that there were fewer traditions and precedents to fall back on than in a larger branch where community weddings are more common. Every detail from food to photographer to reception hall needed to be researched thought about decided. With their blood families an ocean away in Hawaii (in Thomas’s case) and a 900-mile drive away in Minnesota (in Jeanette’s case) their Christians in Mission team members became the family to fall back on when it came to planning and executing. The CIM team in turn fell back on the Shreveport branch just as they do each summer when Action volunteers come to town. For the wedding weekend 32 guests stayed in the CIM team’s seven houses on Yale Avenue in addition to the 21 team members who normally live there. Another 31 guests stayed with Shreveport branch members and hospitality coordinator Patti Deakin says that somehow she didn’t have to turn anybody away.  Cliff and Jackie Vaughan opened an empty house they own to Jim and Beth Bulger and Elizabeth Pease from Servant Branch Kate Zenker and Annie Bulger from South Bend along with Justin and Cathy Walters from the Indy South Side and four Purdue University students who slept in sleeping bags in an apartment above the garage. “You never knew who you would be eating breakfast with” said Beth. The distances from Shreveport to Hawaii and Minnesota meant that the parents of the bride and groom Tom and Mary Duddy of Kaneohe (Oahu) and John and Jo Zimmel of St. Paul (Servant Branch) had never met prior to the week of the wedding. The Duddys had never met Jeanette except through Skype video conferences on their computer. At the bachelor party on Thursday night Pat Malone shared a story about Thomas that revealed how deeply Thomas identifies with his Allendale neighbors. Three years ago Ed Allison a gentleman in his early 70s was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor. “Ed was given a short time to live” Pat recalled. When Thomas heard the news “he was moved by love for Ed and he told the Lord in no uncertain terms that this wasn’t Ed’s time to die.” Thomas began visiting Ed talking about the Lord with him praying with him using his skills as a nurse to help him. He got everyone on the CIM team to pray for Ed and to the shock of everyone in the hospital Ed recovered. He had arrived at the hospital in a wheelchair but he left on his own two feet and began living independently again. “Ed will tell you that the prayers of Thomas and everyone else kept him alive” Pat said. The rehearsal dinner on Friday night took place beneath a white canopy erected in the grass front yard of 1434 Yale Avenue. Folding tables dressed with white tablecloths held handmade centerpieces: glass vases filled with purple wandering Jew plants and their tiny pink flowers gathered from the yard. Catherine Bulger (South Bend) arranged the food and service for the 71 guests. It was simple fare: subs from Walmart homemade guacamole hummus and salad. About an hour before the dinner a car from Servant Branch arrived carrying the servants: the Bulgers Elizabeth Pease Nancy Grams Mary Bredenburg and Kate Zenker. This was by design to enable the CIM team members to pause from their preparations and savor the moment. After the main course Thomas and Jeanette stood up and honored their parents. Thomas said that during his late teenage years he had begun living a wayward life. Later in his 20s after the Lord had opened his eyes he had told his father that he wanted to build a stronger relationship with him even though it would need to be built at a distance. Thomas had decided to move to Servant Branch to live with the Brotherhood for a time and to attend college. “You welcomed me back” he told his father. Though it wasn’t mentioned at the rehearsal dinner on Friday night Ron Gouveia (Oahu) a longtime friend of the Duddys and the only other member of the Oahu branch who was able to make the 4000-mile trip sees some parallels between the choices of Thomas and Tom. “The Duddys came to Hawaii in 1980 because of military service. They are originally from the east coast. Five or six years after they came they had to make a decision about where to go next and they decided that the Lord was calling them to stay and be part of the Oahu branch.” Staying in Hawaii meant that the Duddy kids would not have much contact with their east coast relatives and that branch members would have to play the roles of aunties and uncles of grandmothers and grandfathers. “The Duddys laid down their lives for the building of the People of Praise” says Ron. “I can see Thomas following in their footsteps.” In her sharing Jeanette said that her parents had placed a high priority on personal prayer when she was growing up leaving a lasting impression. She recalled seeing her mother sitting in a chair each morning having her prayer time. Jeanette didn’t always see her father pray but she knew that he had prayed whenever she saw him at breakfast reading the comics in the morning paper. Her dad had made a commitment to get his prayer time in before ever turning to the funnies. After the honorings the mosquitoes came out in force and the group moved inside 1434 Yale where members of the Missionary Company from Evansville took up banjo cello mandolin and harmonica for the first of several weekend musical performances. Ringing out a riff in the clawhammer style Nick Holovaty kicked off an uptempo bluegrass number he had written. Mary Timler laid down the low notes by plucking on her cello. The lyrics of the tune spoke of the way in which Jesus spreads his message “Face to Face One by One” also the song’s title.  Just before noon the next morning wedding guests collected their programs at church from a young teenage girl in a shimmering dress whom Jeanette had befriended over the course of her years living in Allendale. Fr. Chuck Wood (Vancouver-Portland) presided and Mike Coney (New Orleans) a deacon preached and received the wedding vows. The first reading came from the prophet Zephaniah: “I will save the lame and assemble the outcasts; I will give them praise and renown in all the earth when I bring about their restoration.” The Gospel reading was Matthew 5:1-12 the Beatitudes “Blessed are the poor in spirit . . . .”  In his homily Mike emphasized that Jesus intended the Beatitudes to be lived out by his followers and that the blessings and rewards mentioned in connection with mourning meekness etc. are meant for this life not only for the life to come. They are the fruit of living the gospel. The petitions like the cake pointed to mission—both the community’s mission and the mission of the whole church: “For boldness in proclaiming the gospel for faith in good times and in bad for greater unity among all Christians . . . we pray to the Lord.”  They also included a prayer for Ed Allison who had taken a turn for the worse in the weeks leading up to the wedding. The missionaries sang two hymns: “How Firm a Foundation” and a rewritten version of “Hark I Hear the Harps Eternal.” “The choral music was absolutely glorious” said Ron Gouveia. “The Lord was there in such power” added Teresa Lynch (Shreveport). “The focus was on this wonderful thing that God was doing for Thomas and Jeanette. It wasn’t anything like the traditional wedding. I kept thinking I wish my daughters could see this!” The rain that began midway through the wedding ceremony continued joined by lightning and thunderclaps during the reception which took place in a hall on the grounds of the American Rose Society. As she raised a glass to toast Jeanette Kathleen Mehaffey her maid of honor told a bit of Jeanette’s story. Jeanette has lived in Allendale two times first beginning in 2007 for three years then again starting in the fall of 2012 (following a two-year stint in the Missionary Company). “When Jeanette lived here the first time she and Laura Brummer would go out visiting older women who lived alone in our neighborhood. Jeanette was moved by these women and loved them. After prayer and discernment she helped start a walking group with them. Five years later these women are still walking three times a week and some of the women are here celebrating with Jeanette today.” Jeanette works as a phone operator at the Spine Institute of Louisiana where she is known for the limericks she writes on colored paper for the doctors and each of the staff members on their birthdays. “Jeanette carries with her the fragrance of Christ” Kathleen said. “It lingers in the places she has worked the households she has lived in and it rests on anyone who has had a conversation with her.” Thomas also has a reputation at his job—for praying with his patients as Nathan Barrett his best man pointed out in his toast. Thomas is a nurse at the VA hospital in Shreveport. Recently he leaned over to pray with a patient as a student nurse stood by watching him. “I didn’t know we were allowed to do that!” the student told Thomas later. Another time a patient caught up with Thomas after he had prayed with him. “As soon as you left my room after praying with me” he said “I had to call up my family and tell them ‘You guys won’t believe it but Jesus lives at this hospital. This nurse just came up and prayed with me!’” After the toasts and customary first dances Jo Zimmel called everyone up to dance the Virginia reel a country dance. “I asked for two sets of eight couples” she says but she was surprised when four sets of eight couples arranged themselves and prepared to dance. Soon she was having trouble teaching everyone the steps. One of the servers from the catering company stepped in to help as did others who knew the routine. “It was more like bumper cars than the Virginia reel” observed Patti Deakin. “Everyone was laughing and having so much fun even the catering guys were videoing it on their phones and just laughing.” Cheers rang out as Nathan Barrett and Nick Raway sashayed forward and back while holding Madeleine Barrett (age 18 months) and Marie Elise Barrett (age three). All the while two uniformed sheriff’s deputies (their presence was mandated by the Rose Society) sat outside the building with guns and Tasers at their side. (One drove up in a paddy wagon the other in a Police Interceptor.) The officers were looking serious until Nick Raway sent them inside to get some gumbo red beans and rice and banana pudding. The reception ended at six but an hour later guests began to reassemble back in Allendale for another party. The party grew and stretched across three houses and onto their front porches. Near the end the missionaries performed a few more numbers. Chris Vieck shared a bluegrass song she had written for her father. The missionaries reprised “Face to Face One by One” with the whole crowd joining in on the chorus. Rus Lyons performed a rap he wrote called “The Clear and Present Gospel.” Everyone sang along to the old spiritual “Ride on King Jesus” and to J-T Kelly’s song “City of God.” The party ended with the Wesleyan hymn “I Will Arise and Go to Jesus.” On Sunday a few of the out-of-town guests toured the neighborhood including Nancy Grams. “I’ve seen pictures and videos but I was totally astonished. The houses the porches the sidewalks—it was really beautiful. I could see how we were being a light just by living ordinary life just by being who we are in the People of Praise. It’s so easy to do it because we are right there.” The next Tuesday back home in Hawaii Tom Duddy reflected on the meaning of all that he had seen. “I am proud of the Oahu branch way out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and the impact that we have been able to have on the whole life of the People of Praise. Over the years we’ve sent out Dave Sklorenko Bob and Bev Linczer Geoff and Sue Kelleher Bob Chukinas Larry and Valerie Day Joe Gomes Zach Busekrus and others and now Thomas. Even though we are a small and distant branch we have been able to have an impact.” A moment before the wedding party stepped into the aisle to begin their closing procession  Fr. Chuck read a blessing: “May you be witnesses in the world to God’s charity so that the afflicted and needy who have known your kindness may one day receive you thankfully into the eternal dwelling of God.” Chris Vieck (Mission Division Evansville) a bridesmaid said later that the words struck her. “I know one of the reasons Jeanette wants to be married is to take care of lots of people.” “Individually Thomas and Jeanette both have a deep heart for the poor and those who haven’t had the gospel preached to them” said Tom Duddy. “They wanted the wedding to make a statement about that work. Their intention their expectation is to spend their married life in Allendale. It isn’t a stopping point on the way to something else.” Thomas and Jeanette are simply moving ahead two who have become one into the joy taking no notice of the rain. Thomas and Jeanette now live in a house on Yale Avenue that Action volunteers renovated with help from Ed Allison. Ed died four days after the wedding.

Otis Kenner pastor of Fresh Faith Worship Center presiding bishop of Kingdom Growth Fellowship of United Churches in New Orleans and vice-president of River Regions Theological College Marriage in Christ has not only been helpful in his marriage but also a source of racial reconciliation as well.I had been serving a national pro-life organization as a liaison to African Americans often as a sidewalk counselor trying to rescue those unjustly sentenced to death. My duties also involved traveling around the country speaking at national conferences seeking to wake up African-American pastors to the disproportionate numbers of black children being killed. After some time in that position events convinced me that I was the group’s token black person–admittedly anointed by the Holy Spirit but useful only because of my race. It came to a climax when I experienced what I took to be a moment of socially acceptable racism at a conference in Kansas.I couldn’t take it anymore and feeling betrayed by white people in general I left the group in anger and disgust. I’d had enough of white people. I remembered the time years before when a burning cross had been placed in the lawn of my family’s home. I had two uncles who were murdered by the KKK. The house in which my wife and I lived had been vandalized three times and the police did not act against the known culprits. I had endured 40 years of racism in the world but this incident of racism was in the church for goodness sake!I only bothered to get to know Lloyd Mehaffey (New Orleans) because mutual friends fellow pastors introduced us. Lloyd invited me and my wife Tyra to a MIC seminar where we met his wife Kathy and Tom and Diane Evans. The kindness and dignity with which they treated us totally eradicated the pain I had been experiencing. Their words and actions demonstrated that they understood how awful some of our experiences had been. We shared bread and passed the cup. Relating to the four of them has been a healing experience. We’re looking forward to working with them on bringing the Marriage in Christ program to many in the African-American community.
20200927033348,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”

(Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame.

Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame.

Below is an explication of the covenant which Paul gave at the 1976 covenant-making community meeting in South Bend. At the end of the talk Paul read the covenant aloud. You may notice that it differs slightly from the version we use today. In January 1986 the board of governors approved two revisions to the covenant. The first is that the word “basic” was omitted to avoid confusion with other unrelated groups known as “basic communities.” The second is that the word “Church” was made lowercase to better reflect the diversity of our various denominations. We hope that reading and discussing this will deepen your appreciation of what the Lord has called us to.  Barb Potts (right) congratulates Audrey Rebar on making the covenant in Corvallis on October 15.

(Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame.

Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame.

(Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people.

Below is an explication of the covenant which Paul gave at the 1976 covenant-making community meeting in South Bend. At the end of the talk Paul read the covenant aloud. You may notice that it differs slightly from the version we use today. In January 1986 the board of governors approved two revisions to the covenant. The first is that the word “basic” was omitted to avoid confusion with other unrelated groups known as “basic communities.” The second is that the word “Church” was made lowercase to better reflect the diversity of our various denominations. We hope that reading and discussing this will deepen your appreciation of what the Lord has called us to.  Barb Potts (right) congratulates Audrey Rebar on making the covenant in Corvallis on October 15.

(Not pictured: their son Chris.) Behind them is the community center and Tim and Jo Wagner’s home. by Chris Meehan and Anne Osterhouse Photos: John Carey If you stand on top of Mary’s Peak—at 4097 feet the tallest point in the Central Oregon Coast Range—you can clearly see a large red colonial-style house which sits on top of a hill outside Corvallis. Set back from an idyllic country road which is flanked on one side by a Douglas fir woods and on the other by tidy garden beds and a handful of well-pruned fruit trees the house is at the heart of a cluster of 10 houses originally built and owned by members of The Vine and the Branches community which later became the Corvallis branch. For 40 years it has been the site of many branch gatherings parties and meetings the house where scores of people have stayed for a night or a few months and the yard where many branch children have played games long after dark on summer evenings. This year since long-time owners Francis and Betty Johnson have moved into an assisted living facility it is switching owners but—to the relief of many—it is staying in the community. When Tom and Jessica Melton’s fifth child Lydia was born last March they knew their house a few miles away from “the hill” as the cluster is known wasn’t going to last their family much longer. They had already felt like their house at 1350 square feet was bursting at the seams even before adding a new baby to the mix. They were confident that the Lord would provide for their need but they had no idea how. They started considering building an addition. Last summer Francis 91 and then Betty 95 each developed congestive heart failure which hastened their decision about whether to stay in their house. Both builders by nature Francis was part of the group of men who built most of the houses on the hill and Betty and he had spearheaded the creation of an assisted living center in town where they moved in December.  The former “Johnson Hotel” stands on one acre at the very top of a hill and is a prominent feature in the area. When the Johnsons decided to sell their house and move branch members started asking “How can we keep it in the community? Who could live in it?” The Meltons certainly needed more space but they knew the Johnsons’ house would be too expensive for them. They never even considered it. John and Mary Lou Carey have lived down the hill from the Johnsons for many years and shared a garden with them. In 2001 while the Careys were remodeling their own house they and two of their teenage children moved in with the Johnsons for two months. Mary Lou is a retired nurse and as the Johnsons began developing health problems last year the Careys often walked up the hill to assist them. When the question of what to do with the Johnsons’ home arose the Careys realized that they could help even though they weren’t looking for a house themselves. They agreed to purchase the house as an investment and offered it to the Meltons on a lease-to-own basis. Jessica Melton is the daughter of branch members Chris and Colette Taylor and grew up on the hill. Her father Chris built the Johnsons’ house in 1977 along with Francis and Chris’s brother Frank. “Having the opportunity to live in Francis and Betty’s house was totally unexpected–the farthest thing from my mind” says Jessica. “Although the Lord had made it clear to me that he was going to provide the additional space we needed I never imagined I would be able to live across the street from where I grew up in a house my father built. It’s really awesome that the Careys have made it possible for us to afford it.”  Tom and Jessica Melton with four of their five children along with Francis and Betty Johnson in the living room of the house. The Johnsons’ house will be a big upgrade in space for the Meltons. It has 2700 square feet of finished space plus a large unfinished basement. The first floor has a kitchen living room master bedroom bathroom family room with a fireplace and a dining room. Upstairs there are two bedrooms another bathroom a small sewing/hobby room and a very large bonus room that is 15 feet wide by 30 feet long in which the Johnsons kept many beds almost like a dormitory. (The Meltons are renovating the bonus room adding a wall to turn it into two bedrooms bringing the total number to five.) Francis explains that they had not originally planned to make the house so big. “At first we weren’t especially focused on hospitality but we built the house extra large because the Lord told us to.” Eventually they were hosting so many people that the house became known as the “Johnson Hotel”. “The Johnsons were gracious enough to let community children and their friends play around their house on summer evenings even after dark” adds Tim Wagner. “Because it was centrally located and there were shrubs and trees for hiding plus a deck to use as home base Francis and Betty were happy to have the children play even after they had turned in for the night.”  Chris Taylor along with other family and branch members is volunteering to help the Meltons to renovate the house before they move in. It was the kind of life that the founders of the hill or Christian Village as it is also called had hoped and planned for. In 1977 Fr. Charlie Harris C.S.C. the Johnsons the Hackenbrucks the Taylors the Wagners and a few other families then part of The Vine and the Branches community bought 12 acres of rolling farmland together. They divided the property into one-acre lots and eventually built 10 houses positioning them on the corners of lots to allow for future growth and for large common spaces between them spaces that have served as sites for picnics pig roasts volleyball games and relay races over the years. An 11th home belonging to Phil and Jean Monaco lies across Nash Street and was not part of the original parcel of land. One of the lots already had a small farmhouse on it which served as Fr. Charlie’s home and office. Now expanded the house serves the branch as a community center. Six of the original 10 homes are still owned by community members and the community. For the longtime residents the hill is full of memories—like the time three families went in together and bought a few head of cattle. As Tim recalls “One day they escaped their pen. I still remember us running down the road trying to round them up.” “Sometimes I’ll just see someone’s car in their driveway and use it as an excuse to stop by” Tim adds. “The other day I delivered a mincemeat pie to Connie Hackenbruck who shares my taste for them and she Terry and I sat around and reminisced about community history for 30 minutes.” “We’re so grateful for the Careys’ generosity which will allow our original vision for shared life to continue” says Phil Monaco the principal branch coordinator. “This has been a big change for us. The Johnsons have always been literally at the center of our life and we greatly miss them up on the hill. Their magnanimous generosity to every person has been absolutely beyond compare and inspiring but it will be great to have a young family filling the gap. Our proximity has made a lot of wonderful things happen over the years and it’s precious to us.” Tom and Jessica are looking forward to continuing all the hospitality a house with five children will allow once they move in probably in February. “It’s a consolation to me that they will love it like we did and will take care of it” says Francis. He and Betty have recently been heard to say “The Johnson Hotel has new proprietors and from now on will be called the Melton Hilton.”
20200930062514,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3080,Dec. 27 2012 10:35 a.m.,"In Minnesota, Christmas Comes to Prisoners' Children","By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly Around 100 Servant Branch members continued a long tradition this December by buying Christmas presents and delivering them to children of prisoners. Bob O’Connell organized this year’s effort just as he has for the last 30 years. ""Bob and so many others have worked tirelessly for years in this wonderful labor of love” notes principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler. The gift-giving is part of Project Angel Tree a national ministry started by Mary Kay Beard a former convict who became a Christian. Angel Tree began in Alabama in 1982 and quickly spread. Bob read about it in New Wine magazine soon after and suggested that Servants of the Lord community get involved. The tradition continued after Servants of the Lord became part of the People of Praise. Bob estimates that community members have given presents to about 2000 children over the years. This year Servant Branch members made phone calls bought presents wrapped them and delivered them to families in the Twin Cities and their suburbs as well as in towns spread across the region from Hudson Duluth and Superior to as far as Fargo North Dakota. They bought and delivered Christmas toys and clothing to 67 children of prisoners. “But the numbers aren’t the goal” Bob is quick to say. “The goal is bringing the Lord to the children their guardians and to incarcerated parents.” Some of the community volunteers are new to Angel Tree--like the young Girls of Praise who baked Christmas cookies to accompany the presents--but many of the volunteers have served with Bob from the beginning. “Bob’s passion for Angel Tree is contagious” admits Brad Bye who has often helped deliver gifts. This year he drove 150 miles north to Duluth Minnesota to deliver packages then he delivered 10 more in the Iron Range area of the state 50 miles farther north. Project Angel Tree sometimes makes long-distance delivery requests of Bob if there aren’t enough local churches to support the ministry. Delivering the presents has led to many memorable moments. Dave and Julie Hrbacek bring their children along to share the experience. John Zimmel who delivers presents with his wife Jo remembers one little boy in the second or third grade who was home alone when they arrived--and very excited to receive his gifts. Jim Cahill a long-time helper uses his contacts in the grocery industry to obtain generous discounts on turkeys that go along with the gifts. He remembers a delivery intended for three brothers two of whom were playing videogames with a friend when Jim arrived. When Jim asked ""Who wants a bible?"" the friend said he wanted it. Jim offered to pray with him and the boy accepted. When Jim prayed tears came to the boy's eyes. “Two minutes can change a life” says Jim. “Because we’ve been doing this so long I sometimes recognize the name of an 18-year-old child who was two years old when we first gave her an Angel Tree Christmas Tree present” Bob says. He adds that he is always moved by the written messages from incarcerated parents that go along with the gifts. “It’s a wonderful thing” says Ruth Jorgenson who helps call the guardians of the children ahead of time to get some understanding of their needs and wants. “We’re fortunate that we can help.”"

Click here to see our response to the most recent press attention we have been receiving. By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. A Broad OutreachIn recent years the People of Praise is perhaps best known as the founder of Trinity Schools three junior high/high schools which between them have won eight Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. For more than 35 years our schools have had a reputation for encouraging students to ask questions engage in spirited dialogue and draw their own reasoned conclusions. “I know of no better school in these United States” the late political philosopher Russell Kirk said of our flagship school in South Bend IN. Then there is our missionary work. Over the past 15 years the People of Praise has sent more than 100 people to live in some of America’s forgotten corners—places like Ms. Anderson’s Shreveport neighborhood where the per capita income is under $14000. There we and our neighbors have built and renovated homes run summer camps for thousands and started an elementary school for our neighborhood Praise Academy at Lakeside. In Evansville IN a group of People of Praise missionaries moved into two houses at a notorious intersection a place locals called “the devil’s corner” because of all the fights and drug deals. We didn’t arrive with any program or magic formula but hoped to encounter neighbors in a spirit of Christian friendship. Even so our neighbors have told us that crime has dropped off significantly because of the community we and they are building. “Every night there would be something bad going on and the police would have to park and just watch everybody” one long-time Evansville resident said. “It’s just remarkable how things have changed.”  On another front our community life provides a natural support for marriages and families and this has led us to develop Marriage in Christ a five-week course that equips couples to pray together and build crucial habits of conversation. More than 1000 couples have completed the program.Our RootsThe People of Praise has some of its roots in the Pentecostal revival that grew from a group of poor African Americans in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. Those humble believers experienced a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewal of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues. They were ridiculed in the press called “fanatics” and mocked for their lively worship. But the revival went on to inspire half a billion people including millions of Roman Catholics. The People of Praise also has roots in the Cursillo an evangelistic movement founded in Spain by Catholic laymen in the 1940s which spread to Mexico and the United States influencing some of our founding members. In 1971 after nearly seven years spent praying and studying the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers 29 people made a covenant commitment to put their lives and their futures in common. The People of Praise was born. Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage.

20201001030536,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6160,Nov. 8 2017 11:10 p.m.,People of Praise: Hard to Understand and That’s OK,A People of Praise community barbecue in Shreveport Louisiana. Click here to see our response to the most recent press attention we have been receiving. By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony.

20201001050700,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”

From left: JT McManmon Geriann Raway Chris Raway Matt Brickweg Jim Bulger Beth Bulger Mary Brickweg and her daughters. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Robert Cunningham Photoresource; Chris Raway; JT Mcmanmon The West Side of St. Paul is a neighborhood of contrasts. It’s the sort of place where you’ll find grand Victorian-era homes with their arched brick balconies close to tired-looking slum apartment buildings with fleece blankets covering the windows. On summer Saturdays a farmer’s market pops up in the parking lot of a former Dairy Queen now called the Icy Cup which sells tacos in addition to sweet treats. The whole neighborhood slopes down a hill from south to north ending abruptly in a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River with downtown St. Paul in all its glory visible on the opposite bank. Knocking on doors at random you’re just as likely to meet a Mexican grandmother and her teenage granddaughter a family of Muslim immigrants from Africa a white woman smoking in Tweety-bird slippers or a college-educated couple in their first home. Ask locals where they live and they won’t say “St. Paul.” Welcome to the West Side a place where community members have been deliberately clustering and reaching out since the fall of 2014. Today the initial West Side outreach team consists of Mary Bredenberg Matt and Mary Brickweg Jim and Beth Bulger Tony Kuplic JT McManmon Chris and Geriann Raway and Pat Murphy who heads the outreach. (A second outreach team is in its early stages—see below.) The first team meets weekly for a meal where they plan and share the fruit of their activities. They join together for prayer early on Tuesday and Thursday mornings at the Brickwegs’ house where Madeleine 4 and Vera 2 act as joyous ringleaders dancing about and clapping along to the guitar. They see one another often. The Brickwegs and Raways live next door to each other on Winifred Street the Bulgers live two houses down and JT McManmon lives one street over.  The Brickwegs’ house (left) is next door to the Raways’. “The common life that the team members are living together is thick” Pat says. “There is a lot of time that people are spending together. The team members are becoming fast friends and their life together may be the biggest thing happening in our West Side work right now.” Long-term he says they hope that the life they’re building will attract neighbors. In small ways that attraction is already setting in.***In the summer of 2017 many community members came together to put on a day camp in a local park for neighborhood children. Through the camp they met several local families most of them originally from Mexico and some new relationships began to blossom. At a cookout on the evening of the last day of camp Mary Brickweg met an expectant mother and offered to make a meal for her family when the baby came. A few weeks later Mary was making plans for the meal and called the mother to work out the logistics. “I asked her how many people to cook for and she rattled off her family and then she said ‘Oh and your family of course too.’” When the day came Mary helped set the table and a grandfather gave Matt a tour of improvements he’d made to the house. “It felt like we were just waltzing into the home of a family we’d known forever” Mary says.  A view of downtown St. Paul from Prospect Park near branch members’ homes. Another new friendship began when Maricruz Hernandez brought her two grade-school-age boys to the camp and realized she’d seen Beth at church. Beth offered to babysit and stunned Maricruz when she came to pick the boys up by declining an offer of payment. Maricruz remembers “She said ‘Think of it as if a grandma was babysitting. That felt really nice because my mom is not here. Even my aunts charge me for babysitting.” At the time Maricruz and her husband Francisco had been living in an apartment building whose front steps attracted a wandering group of teenagers smoking and drinking. One day last fall Maricruz called Beth to ask if the West Side team could come pray with one of her sons who was sick. Beth Jim and Chris arrived first and had to walk through a crowd of about 15 on the porch. “Tensions among the youth were escalating” Beth recalls. As the three of them stood in a small foyer waiting for JT to arrive Chris urged them to pray and they began to pray deliverance prayers in full view of the crowd on the porch. “Pretty soon after that we noticed that this crowd of kids was gone” Chris said. After that the group stayed away according to Maricruz. A few weeks later Maricruz and Francisco learned that their rent was going up so they started to think about moving. The rental house next to Matt and Mary was vacant left in poor condition by former residents. Maricruz was convinced they wouldn’t be able to afford to rent a house but decided to look anyway. The owner was reluctant to rent the house again because it was in such bad shape but when they toured the house they struck a bargain that involved Francisco working to improve the house in exchange for a reduction in rent. Over the last few weeks of December the Raways and Bulgers and their adult children visiting over the holidays put in many hours helping Francisco and Maricruz get the house ready. They cleaned the house from top to bottom refinished floors and painted. “I have never felt God’s love that much” Maricruz says.  Dinner before the team meeting at the Brickwegs’ includes a few guests. The friendship between Francisco and Maricruz’s family and the team members continues to grow and now includes a regular outreach men’s group meeting and women’s group meetings not to mention Spanish practice. Since fall the Raways and Beth have been taking classes believing that God may want them to get to know many more Spanish speakers in the area.***John Ostby dates his decision to move to the West Side to a branch men’s retreat in the spring of 2016. Nick Holovaty (Mission Evansville) led the retreat and at one point he asked the men to take five minutes in silent prayer and ask the Lord for a word for someone in their men’s group. After the prayer Bruce Olson came up and tapped John on the shoulder. He reminded John of a story from the Gospels in which Jesus tells his disciples to throw their nets on the other side of the boat. As John tells it Bruce said “I believe that’s a word for you and Sandy and I believe it’s also a word for Charlene and me.” John answered “I believe you’re right and I believe that means the West Side. We’re gonna go fish for God on the West Side.” Last summer after some months of prayer and discernment and after selling their suburban homes the Ostbys and Olsons moved to rental apartments on the West Side but they hoped to find houses to buy. One day Charlene took a walk and stopped to pray in front of a house she liked. A man stopped his car and asked what she was doing. Charlene explained that she walked the neighborhood each day to pray for a house. The man paused a moment then said “You know what God’s gonna get you a house and it’s gonna be better than you can imagine.” Then he got back in his car and left. A few months later they came across a large four-bedroom house across the street and around the corner from 490 the former convent on the grounds of St. Matthew’s Parish where Servant Branch college students and community members have been renting apartments since 2016. The house has two bedrooms upstairs and two bedrooms on the first floor with a full bath on each floor and it dawned on them that the two couples could live there together. They plan to move in this May. Together the Olsons and Ostbys are the backbone of a second outreach team which they hope will grow. Their team has a different geographical focus centered on the area around 490 about five blocks away from the cluster where the Bulgers Raways and Brickwegs live.***  A fence in the Icy Cup parking lot emblazoned with local pride. Another prong of the outreach is growing at Cerenity Senior Care a home for seniors which is also close to the 490 apartments. After talking with the chaplain about what might be helpful and trying a few ideas Beth Geriann and Meg Ferber ended up starting a small group called Women in Faith that resembles a women’s group. Geriann explains “We generally share a Scripture passage and are trying to elicit friendship among them particularly in sharing their struggles and praying for one another.” Some of the residents who attend the group are in their 90s or over 100 and others are younger but live at Cerenity for help with various health needs. Beth recalls a birthday celebration in the small group: “One of the women always knows who’s been the hospital who needs to be cheered up or who has a relative in trouble. We found out that it was going to be her birthday so we honored her and we brought her favorite food. We knew she liked music so we brought a guitar that day. She normally is giving a lot of love and sometimes experiences loneliness herself. She was very touched.” Pat says that they hope to start a men’s group at Cerenity in the near future. “There are a lot of people in that nursing home and we might end up having a big impact on them at the last stages of their lives.”***As they go about their days all the community members living on the West Side seek to interact with neighbors paying attention to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and responding in a harmonious way. That might mean walking for a few blocks with an older woman who gets off the bus with three or four bags and needs a little help carrying them. It might mean buying a meal for a homeless man and using the time to talk about the Lord or inviting a married couple over for an impromptu meal and praying with them afterward. As Pat puts it it means always being open to the Lord always asking “What do we see God doing? What’s right in front of us and how can we respond to the things we run into?”

Below is an explication of the covenant which Paul gave at the 1976 covenant-making community meeting in South Bend. At the end of the talk Paul read the covenant aloud. You may notice that it differs slightly from the version we use today. In January 1986 the board of governors approved two revisions to the covenant. The first is that the word “basic” was omitted to avoid confusion with other unrelated groups known as “basic communities.” The second is that the word “Church” was made lowercase to better reflect the diversity of our various denominations. We hope that reading and discussing this will deepen your appreciation of what the Lord has called us to.  Barb Potts (right) congratulates Audrey Rebar on making the covenant in Corvallis on October 15.

(Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”

Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits.

20201003023303,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985).

20201003051447,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8155,Sept. 15 2020 4:28 p.m.,Wildfires Burn in Oregon and Washington,"By Sean Connolly Jim McDowell (Corvallis) recalls the weekends and summers he spent at a cabin his family built amid towering hemlock trees on the north fork of Oregon's Santiam River. Starting from age 12 he helped clear the land and learned to spot Chinook salmon in the river. Over time he came to treasure the cabin as ""a place where you can step away from the world and see God face to face in the quiet.”  The cabin is gone now—burned in the Beachie Creek Fire. Beachie Creek is one of several conflagrations that swept down from the Cascade Mountains towards the heavily populated Willamette Valley home to the community's Corvallis and Vancouver/Portland branches. Energized by high winds it destroyed several small towns and scorched 190000 acres. Closer to Portland the Riverside Fire has burned 134000 acres while the Holiday Farm Fire southeast of Corvallis has burned 166000 acres.   Jim McDowell's family cabin burned in the Beachie Creek Fire.

As of Monday in Oregon 10 people have died from the fires and 22 are reported missing according to the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. The winds have died down for now allowing firefighters a chance to contain the fires. Dry conditions persist but there is rain in the forecast this week. Corvallis itself after experiencing fiery-orange skies and ash falling like a light snow for several days last week is now shrouded in a dense grey fog. The closest fire is 45 or 50 miles away by road and the city is not in immediate danger. All branch members and their houses are safe and yet life is hardly normal. ""We haven't seen the sun in over a week"" Principal Branch Coordinator Phil Monaco noted on Monday morning. ""There are hardly any sounds. Everything is stopped.”  The skies over Corvallis Oregon last week. Photo by Phil Monaco. With their air quality registering in the ""hazardous"" to ""very unhealthy"" ranges according to a U.S. government website branch members are largely staying indoors with their windows closed. The city hasn't picked up the trash in more than a week. Parks are closed. Tom Melton runs a road paving business but can't pave any roads since the asphalt plants are shut down. Tim and Mary Jo Wagner welcomed their son and his young family from Salem Oregon into their home since the Wagners have a good air-filtration system. Geoff and Nancy Myers bought pet food and cleaning supplies and took them to a dropoff point for delivery to evacuees staying at the fairgrounds. Jean Monaco has four cousins who live outside Vida Oregon near the heart of the Holiday Farm Fire. Two lost their homes and she is waiting to hear about the home of a third cousin. Bryan Thompson and his family have been going for decades to a private campground called Taylor Park in Lyons Oregon. They rent a space and have access to it year-round. Bryan says they were there on Labor Day weekend and knew the Beachie Creek Fire was nearby but the winds normally blow to the east so they were not concerned. After they left the winds blew west. “We have heard that all the structures are completely burned” he said. Eighty miles north of Corvallis Portland currently has the worst air quality of any major city in the world according to a report in The New York Times. The closest large fire the Riverside Fire is about 30 miles southeast of downtown Portland. It’s not currently threatening Portland but that could change with a strong westerly wind.  A view of downtown Portland on Saturday September 12. Photo by Lena Glover. ""As soon as you get outside it smells like a campfire” says Principal Branch Coordinator Charlie Fraga. ""Kids can’t go outside and play. It’s tough.”  He adds “Just like with the pandemic people in Portland are adapting to the new situation. You have a smile on your face and you’re praising God all the while.”  As in Corvallis branch members keep their windows shut to keep out the bad air and ash. Kathy Bucheit spoke about sealing cracks with towels and blankets to keep out the ash and the acrid smell. Her nephew is a firefighter battling the fires in Clackamas County just east of Portland where the Riverside Fire is raging. Another nephew in Clackamas had to evacuate. She said she hasn’t gone outside for more than three days except briefly to check the mail. Sunday’s Vancouver-Portland branch meeting was supposed to be held outdoors in small groups but instead took place on Zoom. The meeting included a time of praise and a sharing from branch member Toby Clairmont an emergency preparedness expert on how to create a “go kit” in case branch members need to flee as well as conversation about reaching out to neighbors and intercessory prayer.  A view of the Kenton neighborhood in North Portland. Photo by Charlie Fraga. Similarly at the branch meeting in Corvallis “We spent a good part of our time praying for the fire victims and that the Lord just put the fires out and that we get rain. We really need rain” Phil said. They added prayers for an end to the pandemic for peace amid the social unrest in Portland and for a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit. At their house in Battle Ground Washington Toby Clairmont and his wife Susie have their truck and RV ready to go in case they need to evacuate. They are about 20 miles from the Big Hollow Fire which has burned 20000 acres. Toby leads a volunteer team of amateur radio operators who are ready to help communicate evacuation orders to those living in hard-to-reach rural areas.   Ten or so miles away Jeff Lindberg says he has been able to see the sun through the smoke. “It looks like a full moon.” He adds “It’s been a drag for the kids lately because they want to go outside and play. For the most part we say 'No you can’t' but we let them play a bit yesterday [Monday]. For his part after losing his family’s cabin Jim McDowell says “I can see good coming out of it in the sense that for my family my brothers and sisters there’s an opportunity to bring us all together."" Charlie adds “With danger all around us we’re so grateful to God for protecting us. We ask everyone for prayers for rain for the safety of ourselves and our neighbors for those who have already suffered tragic personal loss for all of the firefighters and for a swift end to the wildfires."""

Hundreds of campers aged 7 to 18 eagerly reunite with friends they haven’t seen in months. Units march across dewy fields to the rhythm of time honored tunes. Campfires blaze in the evening illuminating conversations about Scripture and following Jesus. Counselors who attended camp as children return for their 12th or 15th or 20th year. Archery and bike trips and field games and crafts are in full swing. Servant Camp is here again.  Except it’s 2020 and the coronavirus pandemic still rages. So Servant Camp this year like so much else looks a little no a lot different.    Parking lot opening ceremony in Servant Branch. Photo by Andy Bowar. It’s at three locations instead of one: River Ridge campus in Eagan Minnesota the South Bend branch center and the branch center in Rockford. It’s a day camp rather than the usual five-day overnight affair. Attendance is smaller than usual though still substantial. Campers and staff alike wear masks and mostly stick to interacting with their own unit. Everything is carefully planned--from how to drop kids off to how to clean field equipment between groups. In Minnesota opening and closing ceremonies happen in a parking lot with sound fed via radio transmission to the cars.  222 campers and 77 staff in total attended Servant Camp 2020. Camper attendance in recent years has been about 325. The camp directors did what they could to help the separate locations feel unified including distributing craft materials and t-shirts creating a joint Instagram account and live streaming Minnesota’s opening and closing ceremonies. The camp created a packet of activities people unable to attend could do at home which they posted on their website.  Servant Camp has seen its share of challenges and changes since its inception in 1978. In 1997 longtime staff member George Simmons died at camp. There was a frightening canoe accident. Gail Lee director and wife of former overall director Carmen Lee (Servant Branch) died in 2009. Camp has changed location several times. In 2012 South Bend camp merged with Servant Branch’s Servant Camp to form one joint camp. There have been injuries and illness and heavy storms and tornado threats. So far camp has gone on.   Andy Grams who has designed every camp shirt since 2002 put together this poster of all the shirt designs up to 2017.  Servant Camp 2020 t-shirt. Photo by Colleen Couch. When it became clear that a normal Servant Camp would be impossible this year the directors who meet regularly all year started talking about possibilities. Overall camp director Pat Ficker (Servant Branch) said “We’d get together and pray and say Lord is there something we can do?” Gradually the idea of a day camp on our own properties in separate locations emerged.   Director Jeanne Oberg (Servant Branch) who has served as a counselor since 1981 and a director since 1988 (she says she’s missed one year) credited younger staff with encouraging camp to move forward despite the challenges. “I wanted to take a year off” she said. “My daughter Annie said ‘No Mom we can do this!’” Another young staffer Margaret Maruggi approached her with the idea of a shared Instagram account to keep the locations united.  Pat said that a focus became: how do we do a few things well? Each location settled on activities that they had staffing and capacity for.   Pool noodle tag.   6th grade girls bike trip in Minnesota. Photo by Andy Bowar.  ""Hand arts"" at River Ridge.

Younger groups (1st-7th grade) came in the morning and afternoon. Director Mike Oberg (Servant Branch) selected one unit each day for a flag raising ceremony. Jeanne would gather the staff before children arrived and teach them camp songs to sing that day. Pat said the girls in particular were always singing as they walked from place to place.  John Brickweg ran field games like soccer and big base and pool noodle tag (the better to social distance). Nadine Reinhardt (Servant Branch) per tradition led “hand arts” or arts and crafts. There was a traditional 6th grade bike trip through the city and a 7th grade visit to a climbing tower. In the evening 8th-12th graders came for games snacks and small group prayer and discussion around a campfire.   The South Bend 7th graders went to a ropes course. Photo by Stephen Busk.

South Bend held camp two mornings and evenings flanked by opening and closing ceremonies. Directors Beth Couch and Stephen Busk (South Bend) had the new responsibility of organizing all the local logistics themselves. Beth says “We realized it’s really nice to show up on the bus and everything’s planned. But everybody here really pulled in and helped out and was very flexible to where they could go serve.” South Bend’s camp included archery (taught by two local instructors one of whom is a Trinity parent and one who has trained Olympic archers) “camp crafts” (building fires and other camp skills) a bike trip a ropes course white water rafting and talks in the evening for older campers.   Gaga ball in Rockford.

The last morning they all went on a bike ride and went swimming in the afternoon. The high schoolers split their time between working with the younger campers and doing service projects. One group built a wheelchair ramp for a branch member’s neighbor. The older boys took a canoe trip and the older girls went hiking and kayaking at a local state park. Amy Newburn (Rockford) who helped lead the camp said that many branch members jumped in and helped however they could. She added that she thought the counselors in Rockford learned from observing both Servant Camp and Action camps over the years.   South Bend Ponies. Photo by Colleen Couch. The first and second graders known as the Ponies normally only come for a day camp. The Ponies were the largest group this year with about 15 in South Bend and 22 in Minnesota. Stephen Busk remarked that it was a blessing to have camp for the younger children in South Bend who wouldn’t normally travel to Minnesota for a day camp. “It makes me wonder if we should do this every year--have a local day camp for them” he said.    Older boys play ultimate frisbee in Minnesota.   Learning ""camp crafts"" in Servant Branch.  The weather was glorious. All three locations had highs in the 70s low humidity cool breezes and not a drop of rain which reportedly may be a Servant Camp first. The evening attendees in Minnesota were treated to show stopping sunsets.  Pat said the weather was a gift from the Lord because the whole plan for camp was weather dependent. Heavy rain or storms or brutal heat would have threatened to cancel the day. Jeanne commented “I wanted something extravagant like renting a food truck or something outrageous. I think the weather was our extravagant thing.” The highlight was being together. Many of the children particularly the younger ones hadn’t seen many of their friends for months. The joy of seeing one another seemed to make up for all the parts of camp that were curtailed. Pat remarked “I thought what the Lord wanted this year was for the kids to be together and run and jump and play. And that was his miracle this year. You should have seen the eyes of these kids!”  Camp director Pat Ficker leads closing ceremonies."
20201003092303,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8182,Sept. 18 2020 4:07 p.m.,Mobile Dodges Bullet from Hurricane Sally,"Neighbor's tree lands on Mary Ellen Naylor's house. by Catherine Bulger Hurricane Sally blew through Mobile Alabama on Wednesday. Though most branch members lost power and many of their properties sustained minor damage—with fallen trees and shingles blown off brothers and sisters are praising God that everyone is safe. With a wind speed of 105 mph Sally made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane early Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores Alabama. Mobile is 40 miles northwest of Gulf Shores and sits at the north end of Mobile Bay which opens into the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately for Mobile the winds shifted slightly pushing water from Mobile Bay out towards the ocean instead of flooding the city.  The hurricane traveling at just two miles per hour stalled over the region for many hours. In Mobile lights began to flick out on Tuesday night and by Wednesday morning Alabama Power reported over 175000 customers without power in the area. Mobile ultimately received about five inches of rain and wind gusts of up to 82 mph according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile Orange Beach AL southeast of Mobile was deluged with nearly 30 inches as was Pensacola FL. “Mobile really dodged a bullet” said branch member Lydia Gaudet.   On Thursday after the storm had moved out and blue skies returned schools and many businesses remained closed. Majestic live oak trees lay uprooted in a historic town square. Myriad crews raced to restore power as quickly as possible and clear the streets of debris. The city imposed an overnight curfew to facilitate cleanup work.   Fallen leaves litter Steve and Lydia Gaudet's street.  Walter and Julia Drey's broken balcony railing. Walter and Julia Drey live on Dog River close to the bay. Their home is raised seven feet off the ground but it has flooded in past storms. Julia reported “The wonderful thing is that the river did not rise. The North wind actually blew the water out of the river so that was a real blessing.” The Dreys did have driving rain seep into the living room through cracks in the doors. They hurried around with towels mopping up water. “We set the alarm at night for every two hours to go around and check the house” she said. A lot of shingles blew off the roof so Walter put a tarp over it to prevent leaking. In the middle of the night the balcony railing finally gave way to the tree that had been beating on it continuously. “We’ve got a lot of yard cleaning up to do” said Julia “but my basic attitude is I’m very grateful it wasn’t worse.”  Mary Ellen Naylor lives with her sister and her adult son daughter and son-in-law. They lost electricity at 10:30 pm on Tuesday. At 3:30 am they heard the crack of the neighbors’ large oak tree followed by the crash as its branches landed on their roof breaking through in four places. Mary Ellen’s son-in-law went out later and cleared away as much tree as he could without the use of his electric chainsaw. He managed to get a tarp over most of the holes for now. “The rain was torrential at times a lot of it happening after dark. Trees were really whipping around” said Mary Ellen.  Branches poking through Mary Ellen's roof into the attic. “The worst part of a hurricane is the heat afterward” said Rose Denton. Bill and Rose Denton also lost power Tuesday night. It was hard to sleep after that especially for Rose and her mother (who lives with the Dentons). Rose was still off work but on Thursday Bill had gone out to the non profit camp he works at and spent the whole day doing cleanup on the property. The Dentons lost the awning over their kitchen door and part of their privacy fence. The cable line was down in the backyard.  Tony and Phyllis Compretta were getting ready on Thursday to put some of their food in Manny and Donna Ganzarain’s freezer since the Ganzarains have a generator. “Our street did look messy” said Phyllis “but people started coming out yesterday and cleaning up yards. There’s a lot of loose shingles. We can’t tell where they came from.” The Comprettas didn’t lose any large trees but Phyllis was mourning the loss of several smaller ornamentals including her crepe myrtle. “There was a lot more wind intensity than we realized it was going to be” she said. “It just went on for hours and hours and hours. I’m glad it wasn’t any worse.”  Steve and Lydia Gaudet also have a generator so they had something of an open door on Thursday with neighbors and grown children coming over to put milk and eggs in the refrigerator make coffee and charge cell phones. One of their children borrowed the camping stove and propane. “When you live here” said Lydia “you keep that stuff around.” “We’re so grateful that everyone is safe and that the damage wasn’t greater” said Mike Coney who is the coordinator from the branch relations council responsible for Mobile. “Please pray for the clean up effort in Mobile and especially for those in Alabama and Florida who sustained major flooding."""
20201003111257,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”

20201003112840,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6126,Sept. 24 2020 8:38 a.m.,The Three Last Words of Bill Kenney,Bill worked as a security guard at Visitation School for 17 years.. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Courtesy of Dorothy Kenney; Anne Kane; Robert Cunningham Photoresource. Editor's Note: This article was originally published on Nov. 3 2017. On a frigid Wednesday last December hundreds gathered for a funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul packing the center section of one of the largest churches in the United States. Some circled the downtown blocks near the cathedral looking for parking and eventually gave up and went home.Outside the mailman asked at the rectory what was going on and the hired motorcycle escort asked the funeral director how he’d gotten such a large event. As the gospel was read a man wearing a bandanna and carrying a backpack came in the side door and walked across the front of the cathedral. On a day with a high temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind chill well below zero he wore sandals with white socks and white pants. While the crowd stood in their pews he walked right up to the casket at the front of the church bent down and kissed it. Then he walked down the center aisle and out the door. Later as the casket was carried out of the cathedral 12th-grade girls from Visitation School wearing white gloves teared up as they lined the aisle. The school declared a day off in his honor. Who was this man loved by so many? He was a security guard. He was a realtor who had once fallen deeply into debt. He wasn’t a rich man or a famous personality. He was Bill Kenney and above all as his son Fr. Kevin Kenney explained in his homily at the cathedral he had three words that he wanted said at his funeral: “Jesus Jesus Jesus.”* * *In the early 1970s Bill Kenney was a hardworking husband and father in the throes of growing a small business. Kenney Realty had three offices in the Twin Cities and 40 licensed realtors. Bill put in long hours showing homes but he still found time to take his seven kids water-skiing. He bought a beautiful large home for his family near Lake Harriet in South Minneapolis. He loved to talk and meet new people he loved a good joke and he loved his wife Dorothy often bringing flowers home for her along with the groceries. He had learned his work ethic early. His father died when Bill was 16 and Bill had taken on two jobs to help support a family of 11 mostly younger siblings. His son Kevin recalls “From the minute we could walk we had to have a job of some sort oftentimes just in his real estate office. I remember as a little kid emptying wastebaskets and vacuuming and cleaning.”  Students at Visitation School lined up as an honor guard for his funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul. In the fall of 1973 Dorothy’s life changed when she decided to attend a weekend introduction to the charismatic renewal put on by their parish. At the retreat Anna Brombach a fellow mother Dorothy knew from church came over to pray with her. Dorothy remembers “I looked down and it wasn’t Anna’s hand taking mine. It was Jesus’ hand. I got home the next day and I was so on fire.” A full turkey dinner was Bill’s favorite thing to cook and he had one waiting for Dorothy when she came home from the retreat. As the kids started washing the dishes after the meal Bill and Dorothy went for a walk around Lake Harriet. Dorothy recalls “I’m jumping and dancing and I said ‘Would you ever go to a prayer meeting with me?’ He said ‘Oh Dorothy. You’ve always been joyful. What’s such a big deal about this? You go to the prayer meeting. I sure as heck don’t want to go.’” For two and a half years Dorothy went to the prayer meetings alone. Then in 1976 Jim Cahill caught Bill and Dorothy as they were leaving mass and mentioned that Bishop Lucker a friend of Bill’s would be at the prayer meeting that night. As Dorothy remembers Jim said “Bill why don’t you come?” and Bill said “Maybe I will.” “I nearly fainted away” Dorothy recalls. At the end of the prayer meeting that night Bill greeted Bishop Lucker. Says Dorothy “The bishop said ‘Bill Kenney! What are you doing here?’ Bill said ‘I don’t come to these things. My wife does’ and Bishop Lucker said ‘You come back five times and then decide if you’re ever going to come again.’ Well Bill obeyed him and he never stopped coming.”* * *Bill quickly became involved in the charismatic renewal attending conferences and praying with people. He and Dorothy joined the growing covenant community in the Twin Cities that would eventually become Servant Branch. Bill insisted that his teenage children attend charismatic conferences and all seven of them were eventually prayed with for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Bill started asking for the Lord’s help in the details of his life. Kevin recalls him praying over broken washing machines as well as his response to car troubles on a road trip. “I think the block cracked in the car. He says ‘We have to pray over it and it’ll get fixed.’ That was his faith.” Many of Bill’s friends recall him counting how many times priests mentioned the name “Jesus” in their Sunday homilies so that he could encourage them later to get their numbers up.  The Cathedral of St. Paul Bill’s parish and the site of his funeral. This shift in Bill’s focus impacted his business life too. By the late 1970s with the economy struggling it became clear that Kenney Realty was overextended. The company and therefore Bill as its owner had fallen hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt. Many years later Bill told the story to the Twin Cities Catholic charismatic renewal: “Because of my finances I decided I needed help. I received the Holy Spirit in my life and got serious about getting out of debt. I always made decisions to do things and then I asked God to bless it but now I was asking God’s opinion as to what I was doing.” Bill started referring to Kenney Realty as a Christian business and instituted an optional daily morning prayer at the office. In 1979 Bill brought in some community members with business experience to form a board of directors for Kenney Realty. Robert Regan who worked in investment counseling and served on the board recalls Bill asking for help with the administrative side of the business. “He was always gregarious a great salesman not as good as an administrator and manager or financial guy.” Good advice from brothers and a demand for houses that came from groups of brothers and sisters moving to the Twin Cities to join the community (from North Dakota Iowa and Washington) kept the business growing for a few years until another economic downturn in the early 1980s. Also in 1979 Bill and Dorothy began a process of downsizing that would continue into the 1990s. Dorothy remembers “To get out of debt he never filed for bankruptcy but he said ‘We have to sell the big house.’ “Dorothy loved their block because they were surrounded by at least eight other large community families and the Kenneys used their house to host morning prayer for the neighborhood but they left it behind for a smaller place on Minnehaha Parkway. Bill’s eye for real estate showed in the deal: the new house was more affordable but still in a lovely spot. Three years later Bill told Dorothy that they would need to sell the smaller house and rent something. To Bill’s surprise the first thing Dorothy asked about was curtains. “I said ‘If you rent a house you don’t want to put fancy curtains in there.’ Of all the crazy things for me to say but that’s what was on my heart at the time.” Soon after that Bill and Dorothy went to look at a condo at the Commodore an old converted hotel in St. Paul. The owner reported “We furnished the whole place and I just spent $10000 on window treatments.” They moved in and eventually bought the condo. Bill set up a small office downstairs where he kept Kenney Realty running as a smaller and smaller business until it finally disbanded in the 1990s when Bill went to work as a realtor for another firm.  Dorothy Kenney stands in front of a photo of herself and Bill on their wedding day two days after he returned from Korea. They were married 62 years. Finally in 1999 a confluence of events ended Bill’s remaining debt for good. Both a community member and a minister Bill had borrowed from separately decided to forgive him those large debts. A year or two earlier Bill and Dorothy had thought about selling the condo to move into a smaller apartment across the street from the Cathedral of St. Paul but it hadn’t sold. Then another apartment opened up in the same building so they put the condo on the market again and it sold for $20000 more than the original listing. Dorothy says “Bill always said ‘God dumped $20000 in my lap.’ So totally totally totally out of debt we started over.” Robert remembers “Bill had been living an upper-middle-class life and he made the transition to less money. He had to change dramatically. He made the transition just no problem at all. He trusted the Lord and never had a depressed day as far as I recall. The Lord let him down very gently step by step and gradually out of debt.” In the midst of all this Bill was busy for the Lord too. He was in Christians in Commerce. He was on the board of DeLaSalle High School his alma mater. He was chairman of the Catholic charismatic renewal in the Twin Cities. He and Dorothy joined the cathedral parish in St. Paul and Bill volunteered to run the men’s club pancake breakfasts. He was also constantly engaged in his favorite pastime talking to people about Jesus. Mark Lauer Bill’s head remembers going out to lunch with Bill. “He would get to know the waiter or waitress by name and a little bit about the person’s story. If any need came up he would say ‘I’ll pray for you.’” Bill and Robert played golf together regularly and sometimes they would pair off with a couple of golfers they didn’t know. Robert says “No matter who we were playing golf with Bill would somehow bring the Lord into the conversation: ‘Do you know the Lord? Are you going to church?’ A lot of people would say ‘I quit going 25 years ago.’ He’d tell them ‘You gotta get back in touch.’”* * *Around the year 2000 Bill took a newly created job as a security guard at Visitation School a Catholic school of about 600 students in Mendota Heights. Visitation starts with pre-K and the older students in grades six to twelve are all girls. Bill arrived in the afternoons and stayed to close the building at night watching the security cameras greeting visitors and walking the last few girls to their cars after dark. He discovered that the parking lot was a little chaotic in the afternoon with students crossing the street at the same time that vehicles needed to leave so he started coming in earlier to direct traffic sometimes in a funny winter hat.  A blanket from Visitation sits on Bill’s favorite recliner. Rene Gavic the head of school at Visitation remembers “He was the go-to person. He knew everything. He had keys for everything. He was a good problem-solver so if someone’s car wouldn’t start they would go to Bill first. He cared about you and would help you and support you in any way.” Bill noticed when the students were having difficulties. Mary McClure who teaches religion at Visitation recalls “He would ask ‘Would you like me to pray with you?’ He waited until he knew there was an opening. Sometimes girls would share a healing: they needed to run and they’d had an injury so Bill prayed and they were able to participate the next day.” Rene adds a story about her own daughter at Visitation. “When she was 12 she fell in a cross-country race and other runners stepped on her face with their spiked shoes. She needed 22 stitches in her face. As a 12-year-old girl that was challenging for her. I remember her coming to school the very first day back and what she wanted to do was have Mr. Kenney pray with her. He prayed with her and her situation and her self-image–all of that–never bothered her again.” At Visitation Bill developed a strategy for generosity. Once a month the students give one dollar to charity for permission to be out of uniform for the day. Bill dropped by the campus minister’s office on the day she collected the dollars and exchanged larger bills for her pile of ones. “In one of his pockets he had a little vial of oil to pray with people and in the other pocket he had maybe twenty single ones. That would be for the kids whose dollar got stuck in the vending machines” Mary remembers. Those ones also often made their way into the hands of the homeless.  Bill as St. Nicholas at his church in 2015. There’s no way to know for sure if the man who kissed his casket at the funeral knew Bill but we can be quite sure that Bill would have cared about him if he had ever met him on the street. In his later years Bill’s friends remember him always going up to homeless people standing on corners telling them that Jesus loved them and giving them one or two dollars for a cup of coffee. That human contact was important to him. Bill’s son Kevin adds that he would also offer a dollar or two when someone at the grocery store didn’t have enough to pay. “I think it was because people had helped him when he was in a time of need. It became a way of life for him” Kevin recalls.* * *On December 4 2016 Bill stayed after church at the cathedral to play St. Nicholas for the children while Dorothy went home. As he was leaving he fell on the sidewalk outside and a passerby called 911. He’d had a stroke and died within a few days. For Christmas Dorothy and the Kenney family gathered at the home of one of her daughters. Bill had dressed as Santa Claus for many years and Santa Claus wasn’t there that year. Dorothy’s kids coaxed her to the front door of the house. Dorothy recalls “Out the front door they had all these jars with candles in them spelling out ‘Jesus’ on the front lawn. It was so beautiful because Bill preached Jesus. I mean he preached Jesus preached preached Jesus.”

They go out in groups of two or three wearing masks and carrying hand sanitizer. They knock on doors and ask simply “how are you doing?” What they’ve found is that many people are willing to talk—more people than in the past. Many are lonely. Some have other needs: for food for jobs for something for the kids to do for medicines and other errands needs around the house the yard and so on. The missionaries have been doing what they can to help dropping off food pulling weeds talking with children running errands for neighbors and always praying. As other neighbors and friends find out about what the missionaries are doing they’ve been getting in on the action—giving the missionaries food and money to distribute. Our missionaries are becoming a conduit for love and service.  This kind of personal visiting going out to our neighbors and checking in is something many of us can do. In a certain sense all you have to do is walk out your front door and encounter your neighbor. The biggest obstacles may be on the inside where the devil sows fear and doubt but Jesus gives us the strength to overcome temptations. We wanted to share this information with you to encourage and inspire you to go out and meet Christ in your neighbors. Christ is suffering now in so many ways. As one spiritual writer put it “We do truly comfort Him most when recognizing Him in our neighbor we serve and love our neighbor for the love of Him.” As you give this a try in your own neighborhood please send us your own stories of how you are finding Christ in your neighbors. Let’s make this a summer of service!
20201003130708,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6160,Nov. 8 2017 11:10 p.m.,People of Praise: Hard to Understand and That’s OK,A People of Praise community barbecue in Shreveport Louisiana. Click here to see our response to the most recent press attention we have been receiving. By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. A Broad OutreachIn recent years the People of Praise is perhaps best known as the founder of Trinity Schools three junior high/high schools which between them have won eight Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. For more than 35 years our schools have had a reputation for encouraging students to ask questions engage in spirited dialogue and draw their own reasoned conclusions. “I know of no better school in these United States” the late political philosopher Russell Kirk said of our flagship school in South Bend IN. Then there is our missionary work. Over the past 15 years the People of Praise has sent more than 100 people to live in some of America’s forgotten corners—places like Ms. Anderson’s Shreveport neighborhood where the per capita income is under $14000. There we and our neighbors have built and renovated homes run summer camps for thousands and started an elementary school for our neighborhood Praise Academy at Lakeside. In Evansville IN a group of People of Praise missionaries moved into two houses at a notorious intersection a place locals called “the devil’s corner” because of all the fights and drug deals. We didn’t arrive with any program or magic formula but hoped to encounter neighbors in a spirit of Christian friendship. Even so our neighbors have told us that crime has dropped off significantly because of the community we and they are building. “Every night there would be something bad going on and the police would have to park and just watch everybody” one long-time Evansville resident said. “It’s just remarkable how things have changed.”  On another front our community life provides a natural support for marriages and families and this has led us to develop Marriage in Christ a five-week course that equips couples to pray together and build crucial habits of conversation. More than 1000 couples have completed the program.Our RootsThe People of Praise has some of its roots in the Pentecostal revival that grew from a group of poor African Americans in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. Those humble believers experienced a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewal of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues. They were ridiculed in the press called “fanatics” and mocked for their lively worship. But the revival went on to inspire half a billion people including millions of Roman Catholics. The People of Praise also has roots in the Cursillo an evangelistic movement founded in Spain by Catholic laymen in the 1940s which spread to Mexico and the United States influencing some of our founding members. In 1971 after nearly seven years spent praying and studying the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers 29 people made a covenant commitment to put their lives and their futures in common. The People of Praise was born. Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage. Imperfect words will eventually fade but we remain happy and proud to be the category-defying community God has called us to be his People of Praise.   Sean Connolly (@sconnoll) is the communications director for the People of Praise community.

20201003132725,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”
20201003141000,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8012,July 15 2020 10:33 a.m.,A School Year Like No Other,The Greenlawn campus set up for the commencement celebration. Photo by Tess Cassady. By Catherine Bulger with reporting by Kathryn Elliott On a muggy Friday evening in early June Trinity School at Greenlawn faculty members welcomed carloads of graduating seniors and their families onto campus directing them to parking spots along the long lane that runs through the property. Rows of balloon-festooned signs bearing seniors’ names decked the lawn flanking a small tent with a speaker’s lectern. A ring of carefully spaced chairs held faculty and staff. With everyone in place Greenlawn’s first outdoor commencement ceremony commenced.  Two Graduate Award winners gave an opening prayer and a valedictory (the Graduate Award is Trinity School’s highest award). Then each cap-and-gowned senior walked from the cars to stand next to his or her sign. Head of School John Lee closed the condensed ceremony with a brief address. Each senior received gifts prepared by the faculty: a personalized coffee mug a bound booklet of the traditional faculty honorings. a copy of James Joyce’s The Dead and a makeshift diploma because the real ones weren’t available yet—the company that makes them had been closed due to the coronavirus.

In Virginia local officials changed the regulations the day before Trinity School at Meadow View’s commencement allowing for outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people. Capitalizing on this freedom the seniors sat outside six feet apart with their families remaining in their parked cars. There was no commencement speaker because the event came together so quickly but the school decided to present three Graduate Awards instead of the usual two and each recipient gave an address. The graduating seniors walked across the outdoor stage to receive their diplomas. As the seniors departed other students lined the road in their cars to honk them out into the world.  Steve Hendrickson and Beth Schmitz preside over River Ridge's parking lot graduation. Photo by Bob Cunningham. At Trinity School at River Ridge the seniors received their diplomas in drive-through fashion as they entered campus. Seniors families and faculty positioned their cars throughout the large parking lot and stayed inside them for the ceremony. A radio transmitter broadcast the proceedings to all the parked cars. Car horns blared joyfully. Graduates poked their heads out of sunroofs to talk to their classmates. Dr. David Odde a biochemist at the University of Minnesota gave a commencement address. When the new graduates departed the faculty lined their cars into a triumphal corridor for them to pass through. “A lot of the graduates sat on top of cars myself included” said River Ridge senior Abby Theis. “We were able to take off our hats and wave them around.” “We joked about our senior gift being a giant hand sanitizer bottle that said ‘In memory of the class of 2020.’”*** Distance learning at Trinity began in mid-March. When it became clear that the rest of the semester would be held off campus conversations began about how to manage the end of the school year with its numerous traditions and activities and above all graduation. The three heads of school and the deans consulted the seniors and their parents.“They gave us a couple of options. We can do graduation next year or do it in August and a lot of people didn’t like either of these ideas” said Greenlawn senior Julia Zusi. In the end all three schools settled on their variation of an outdoor commencement in June.  Faculty members welcome graduating seniors and family to Greenlawn's campus. Photo by Tess Cassady. Normally Trinity hosts a dinner the night before commencement for faculty seniors and parents. Each senior is individually honored by one of the teachers. River Ridge Head of School Beth Schmitz said “One of the things seniors and parents expressed was really wanting to hear their classmates honored.” So instead of a dinner together River Ridge moved the honorings to a Zoom gathering. Another popular tradition near the end of the term at Trinity is morning prayer sharings given by the seniors. River Ridge was able to move those online as well. At Greenlawn the seniors wrote their sharings and recorded themselves giving them and they were sent to the student body in an email. Meadow View created a webpage to host the spring fine arts events that normally populate May evenings at Trinity. The website featured recordings of ninth- and tenth-grade musical compositions dramatic monologues by the senior drama students photos of senior artwork and a virtual choir produced by the music teacher.  Meadow View faculty delivered gift boxes to the graduating seniors at their homes. Photo courtesy of TSMV. Because the second senior drama production was cancelled Greenlawn decided to broadcast two readers’ theaters as Zoom video recordings that premiered on YouTube with each actor reading his or her part from home. To replace the Greenlawn spring fine arts night the two art teachers compiled a slideshow of all the eighth-grade and senior artwork. At River Ridge three long-serving faculty members retired: Penny Arndt Debby Salmon and Mary Radtke. Among them they have over 70 years of teaching experience at Trinity School. Penny has been dean of girls since the school began in 1987. Beth says it was very hard not to be able to honor them in person but they were able to celebrate the teachers at a virtual end-of-year ceremony on the last day of class. Likewise Greenlawn had two retiring faculty members to honor: Marge Connolly a long-time Humane Letters Seminar teacher and Tom Finke who helped found the school and served as its head from 1981-83 then again from 2002-04 and is moving from teaching to administration. The faculty honored them at a lunch (with tables spaced out for social distancing) the week after school ended.***All the end-of-year celebrations and activities happened on top of the many weeks of pivoting the normal Trinity spring curriculum to an online scaled-back format. John said “The instinct among the faculty was to achieve everything we normally achieve which was great and admirable but also impossible.” Most classes met online via Zoom two or three times a week (instead of daily) for about half the usual amount of class time per day. Teachers and students all needed to learn the technology. Ramping up the pressure some students were sharing computers with siblings and with parents working from home. The school decided to make courses pass/fail and cut back on the normal workload. Julia described her typical day. “I started with personal morning prayer worked out for an hour and then started schoolwork or had class. I would pace while I was reading or jump on the trampoline for 10 minutes in between subjects. Having classes and having morning prayer planned out helped me have a real schedule which was a struggle for the first three weeks.” She added “Most of the senior girls were working six to eight hours a day most of it on the computer. I sometimes get minor migraines that are light-induced so the screen time was hard for me but there’s a nightlight feature that filters out a certain kind of light that bothers people’s eyes.”  A Meadow View student performs a frog dissection from home with classmates on Zoom. Photo courtesy of TSMV. The teachers had to adapt their teaching styles dramatically. Lynda Seasly who teaches girls’ math at Greenlawn learned how to use an iPad so she could do problems in real time on the screen for her students. Mary Radtke who taught Scripture (among other things) at River Ridge would put reflection questions in the Google Classroom group chat. At Meadow View Tim Dusenbury recorded himself reading several chapters of Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov out loud for his students to follow along. Marge Connolly learned how to record short videos and upload them to YouTube so that she could explain difficult terms and concepts without wasting precious minutes of class time. Maintaining motivation to get schoolwork done alone at home was another challenge. Ben Bagiackas a Greenlawn senior said “Because the classes were pass/fail it was much more the guys in my class holding one another to a higher standard. We told each other to put in the effort for the sake of the effort.” Meadow View Head of School Kay Yohe commented “I was very proud of the extent the students kept up with really rigorous material when it was pass/fail. The vast majority of them really hung in there.” “Some subjects got harder” said Joe Whelpley a sophomore at Meadow View. “The new concepts in precalculus were difficult like inequality in matrices. Setting it up was harder because we couldn’t do it on our calculators together. You can’t really troubleshoot a friend’s calculator inputs on Zoom.” On the other hand he added “Chemistry was pretty unchanged. Other classes like Latin and New Testament were unchanged. They’re either translation or reading.” But Joe added that the hardest part of distance learning was missing classmates. “The best part about school—that was taken away from us—was the camaraderie. Seeing them on Zoom was not enough. We would text and say ‘I miss you guys.’ We would try to call one another but it can be hard to coordinate.”  Avy Flory a junior from Meadow View won the competition at The Dailies to recreate a famous work of art. Avy recreated a self portrait by Frida Kahlo. Abby agreed. “We had a goose chase (scavenger hunt) where we had to take pictures and send them in and we were in teams and that really helped. But other than that I didn’t get to see my friends much outside of class and that was hard. Not being able to talk to our teachers or the students was just really difficult.” Trinity Schools President Jon Balsbaugh led the charge in formulating distance learning throughout the difficult months striving to improve the experience. Among other things he created The Dailies—a cross-campus forum to share art music poetry and competitions such as kite-flying and Rube Goldberg competitions. The Dailies’ purpose was purely fun and love of learning. In a letter to the students explaining The Dailies Jon wrote “I encourage you to take time during the day especially to appreciate and respond to beauty. Read the poems and take them to heart. Don’t just glance at the artworks interact with them. And go to a quiet place close your eyes and listen to the pieces of music. Beauty will not be rushed.” “It was a really nice chance to have something that’s not in my normal curriculum” said Maggie Kocon a ninth-grader at River Ridge. “I got a taste of what younger and older students are thinking across all the Trinity Schools.”***There’s no denying distance learning was hard on students and faculty and parents alike. “Everybody’s tired and beat up” said John Lee. “I think people were more mentally and psychologically tired—more mental energy gets used up to keep focus in a way that’s not necessary when you’re rubbing up against people day to day.” Beth Schmitz added “One thing distance learning did was cast a spotlight on things we take for granted every day like 30-second conversations and just being together.”  River Ridge graduating seniors celebrate atop their cars.

Our class never had a field day [as seniors] because fall field day was also cancelled. It was really disappointing. But we still had really good Humane Letters conversations. We still had a final math project and figured out how to make small groups work together. I think [the school] did a good job of making sure we were able to still do all the big things.” Abby added “I’m not sure I would want to do it again but there was a lot of beauty in it.” “I saw the Lord in my students suffering” Marge Connolly said. “And it was a real suffering for them especially the seniors—what they had to give up and lay aside which was really important to them.” All of that may explain why there was such a release of joy as students faculty and parents gathered together in parking lots and on the lawn to celebrate the seniors and their completion of a Trinity School education to celebrate the completion of several months of a Trinity School education as it has never been done before.

Click here to see our response to the most recent press attention we have been receiving. By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. A Broad OutreachIn recent years the People of Praise is perhaps best known as the founder of Trinity Schools three junior high/high schools which between them have won eight Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. For more than 35 years our schools have had a reputation for encouraging students to ask questions engage in spirited dialogue and draw their own reasoned conclusions. “I know of no better school in these United States” the late political philosopher Russell Kirk said of our flagship school in South Bend IN. Then there is our missionary work. Over the past 15 years the People of Praise has sent more than 100 people to live in some of America’s forgotten corners—places like Ms. Anderson’s Shreveport neighborhood where the per capita income is under $14000. There we and our neighbors have built and renovated homes run summer camps for thousands and started an elementary school for our neighborhood Praise Academy at Lakeside. In Evansville IN a group of People of Praise missionaries moved into two houses at a notorious intersection a place locals called “the devil’s corner” because of all the fights and drug deals. We didn’t arrive with any program or magic formula but hoped to encounter neighbors in a spirit of Christian friendship. Even so our neighbors have told us that crime has dropped off significantly because of the community we and they are building. “Every night there would be something bad going on and the police would have to park and just watch everybody” one long-time Evansville resident said. “It’s just remarkable how things have changed.”  On another front our community life provides a natural support for marriages and families and this has led us to develop Marriage in Christ a five-week course that equips couples to pray together and build crucial habits of conversation. More than 1000 couples have completed the program.Our RootsThe People of Praise has some of its roots in the Pentecostal revival that grew from a group of poor African Americans in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. Those humble believers experienced a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewal of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues. They were ridiculed in the press called “fanatics” and mocked for their lively worship. But the revival went on to inspire half a billion people including millions of Roman Catholics. The People of Praise also has roots in the Cursillo an evangelistic movement founded in Spain by Catholic laymen in the 1940s which spread to Mexico and the United States influencing some of our founding members. In 1971 after nearly seven years spent praying and studying the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers 29 people made a covenant commitment to put their lives and their futures in common. The People of Praise was born. Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage. Imperfect words will eventually fade but we remain happy and proud to be the category-defying community God has called us to be his People of Praise.   Sean Connolly (@sconnoll) is the communications director for the People of Praise community.

20201003182543,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6478,March 15 2018 3:14 p.m.,"In Corvallis, a City on a Hill Keeps Shining",Tom and Jessica Melton and some of their children on the deck of their new home. (Not pictured: their son Chris.) Behind them is the community center and Tim and Jo Wagner’s home. by Chris Meehan and Anne Osterhouse Photos: John Carey If you stand on top of Mary’s Peak—at 4097 feet the tallest point in the Central Oregon Coast Range—you can clearly see a large red colonial-style house which sits on top of a hill outside Corvallis. Set back from an idyllic country road which is flanked on one side by a Douglas fir woods and on the other by tidy garden beds and a handful of well-pruned fruit trees the house is at the heart of a cluster of 10 houses originally built and owned by members of The Vine and the Branches community which later became the Corvallis branch. For 40 years it has been the site of many branch gatherings parties and meetings the house where scores of people have stayed for a night or a few months and the yard where many branch children have played games long after dark on summer evenings. This year since long-time owners Francis and Betty Johnson have moved into an assisted living facility it is switching owners but—to the relief of many—it is staying in the community. When Tom and Jessica Melton’s fifth child Lydia was born last March they knew their house a few miles away from “the hill” as the cluster is known wasn’t going to last their family much longer. They had already felt like their house at 1350 square feet was bursting at the seams even before adding a new baby to the mix. They were confident that the Lord would provide for their need but they had no idea how. They started considering building an addition. Last summer Francis 91 and then Betty 95 each developed congestive heart failure which hastened their decision about whether to stay in their house. Both builders by nature Francis was part of the group of men who built most of the houses on the hill and Betty and he had spearheaded the creation of an assisted living center in town where they moved in December.  The former “Johnson Hotel” stands on one acre at the very top of a hill and is a prominent feature in the area. When the Johnsons decided to sell their house and move branch members started asking “How can we keep it in the community? Who could live in it?” The Meltons certainly needed more space but they knew the Johnsons’ house would be too expensive for them. They never even considered it. John and Mary Lou Carey have lived down the hill from the Johnsons for many years and shared a garden with them. In 2001 while the Careys were remodeling their own house they and two of their teenage children moved in with the Johnsons for two months. Mary Lou is a retired nurse and as the Johnsons began developing health problems last year the Careys often walked up the hill to assist them. When the question of what to do with the Johnsons’ home arose the Careys realized that they could help even though they weren’t looking for a house themselves. They agreed to purchase the house as an investment and offered it to the Meltons on a lease-to-own basis. Jessica Melton is the daughter of branch members Chris and Colette Taylor and grew up on the hill. Her father Chris built the Johnsons’ house in 1977 along with Francis and Chris’s brother Frank. “Having the opportunity to live in Francis and Betty’s house was totally unexpected–the farthest thing from my mind” says Jessica. “Although the Lord had made it clear to me that he was going to provide the additional space we needed I never imagined I would be able to live across the street from where I grew up in a house my father built. It’s really awesome that the Careys have made it possible for us to afford it.”  Tom and Jessica Melton with four of their five children along with Francis and Betty Johnson in the living room of the house. The Johnsons’ house will be a big upgrade in space for the Meltons. It has 2700 square feet of finished space plus a large unfinished basement. The first floor has a kitchen living room master bedroom bathroom family room with a fireplace and a dining room. Upstairs there are two bedrooms another bathroom a small sewing/hobby room and a very large bonus room that is 15 feet wide by 30 feet long in which the Johnsons kept many beds almost like a dormitory. (The Meltons are renovating the bonus room adding a wall to turn it into two bedrooms bringing the total number to five.) Francis explains that they had not originally planned to make the house so big. “At first we weren’t especially focused on hospitality but we built the house extra large because the Lord told us to.” Eventually they were hosting so many people that the house became known as the “Johnson Hotel”. “The Johnsons were gracious enough to let community children and their friends play around their house on summer evenings even after dark” adds Tim Wagner. “Because it was centrally located and there were shrubs and trees for hiding plus a deck to use as home base Francis and Betty were happy to have the children play even after they had turned in for the night.”  Chris Taylor along with other family and branch members is volunteering to help the Meltons to renovate the house before they move in. It was the kind of life that the founders of the hill or Christian Village as it is also called had hoped and planned for. In 1977 Fr. Charlie Harris C.S.C. the Johnsons the Hackenbrucks the Taylors the Wagners and a few other families then part of The Vine and the Branches community bought 12 acres of rolling farmland together. They divided the property into one-acre lots and eventually built 10 houses positioning them on the corners of lots to allow for future growth and for large common spaces between them spaces that have served as sites for picnics pig roasts volleyball games and relay races over the years. An 11th home belonging to Phil and Jean Monaco lies across Nash Street and was not part of the original parcel of land. One of the lots already had a small farmhouse on it which served as Fr. Charlie’s home and office. Now expanded the house serves the branch as a community center. Six of the original 10 homes are still owned by community members and the community. For the longtime residents the hill is full of memories—like the time three families went in together and bought a few head of cattle. As Tim recalls “One day they escaped their pen. I still remember us running down the road trying to round them up.” “Sometimes I’ll just see someone’s car in their driveway and use it as an excuse to stop by” Tim adds. “The other day I delivered a mincemeat pie to Connie Hackenbruck who shares my taste for them and she Terry and I sat around and reminisced about community history for 30 minutes.” “We’re so grateful for the Careys’ generosity which will allow our original vision for shared life to continue” says Phil Monaco the principal branch coordinator. “This has been a big change for us. The Johnsons have always been literally at the center of our life and we greatly miss them up on the hill. Their magnanimous generosity to every person has been absolutely beyond compare and inspiring but it will be great to have a young family filling the gap. Our proximity has made a lot of wonderful things happen over the years and it’s precious to us.” Tom and Jessica are looking forward to continuing all the hospitality a house with five children will allow once they move in probably in February. “It’s a consolation to me that they will love it like we did and will take care of it” says Francis. He and Betty have recently been heard to say “The Johnson Hotel has new proprietors and from now on will be called the Melton Hilton.”
20201003184750,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=3080,Dec. 27 2012 10:35 a.m.,"In Minnesota, Christmas Comes to Prisoners' Children","By Chris Meehan and Sean Connolly Around 100 Servant Branch members continued a long tradition this December by buying Christmas presents and delivering them to children of prisoners. Bob O’Connell organized this year’s effort just as he has for the last 30 years. ""Bob and so many others have worked tirelessly for years in this wonderful labor of love” notes principal branch coordinator Joel Kibler. The gift-giving is part of Project Angel Tree a national ministry started by Mary Kay Beard a former convict who became a Christian. Angel Tree began in Alabama in 1982 and quickly spread. Bob read about it in New Wine magazine soon after and suggested that Servants of the Lord community get involved. The tradition continued after Servants of the Lord became part of the People of Praise. Bob estimates that community members have given presents to about 2000 children over the years. This year Servant Branch members made phone calls bought presents wrapped them and delivered them to families in the Twin Cities and their suburbs as well as in towns spread across the region from Hudson Duluth and Superior to as far as Fargo North Dakota. They bought and delivered Christmas toys and clothing to 67 children of prisoners. “But the numbers aren’t the goal” Bob is quick to say. “The goal is bringing the Lord to the children their guardians and to incarcerated parents.” Some of the community volunteers are new to Angel Tree--like the young Girls of Praise who baked Christmas cookies to accompany the presents--but many of the volunteers have served with Bob from the beginning. “Bob’s passion for Angel Tree is contagious” admits Brad Bye who has often helped deliver gifts. This year he drove 150 miles north to Duluth Minnesota to deliver packages then he delivered 10 more in the Iron Range area of the state 50 miles farther north. Project Angel Tree sometimes makes long-distance delivery requests of Bob if there aren’t enough local churches to support the ministry. Delivering the presents has led to many memorable moments. Dave and Julie Hrbacek bring their children along to share the experience. John Zimmel who delivers presents with his wife Jo remembers one little boy in the second or third grade who was home alone when they arrived--and very excited to receive his gifts. Jim Cahill a long-time helper uses his contacts in the grocery industry to obtain generous discounts on turkeys that go along with the gifts. He remembers a delivery intended for three brothers two of whom were playing videogames with a friend when Jim arrived. When Jim asked ""Who wants a bible?"" the friend said he wanted it. Jim offered to pray with him and the boy accepted. When Jim prayed tears came to the boy's eyes. “Two minutes can change a life” says Jim. “Because we’ve been doing this so long I sometimes recognize the name of an 18-year-old child who was two years old when we first gave her an Angel Tree Christmas Tree present” Bob says. He adds that he is always moved by the written messages from incarcerated parents that go along with the gifts. “It’s a wonderful thing” says Ruth Jorgenson who helps call the guardians of the children ahead of time to get some understanding of their needs and wants. “We’re fortunate that we can help.”"

(Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame.

His paternal grandfather fled Stalin’s invasion of Ukraine and was eventually ordained a Ukrainian Catholic priest in Canada.In 1990 when Nick was 10 his parents Orest and Susan (Evansville) took Nick and his sister Claire from Wheaton IL to Moscow Russia. There Orest worked for a Christian foundation supporting churches and missions across the Soviet Union.“My parents’ example showed me that it is worth taking great risks so people have the opportunity to hear the gospel” Nick says.He remembers the evangelists who came to the Holovatys’ home for lunch. “It was in talking to these fervent men from all over the former Soviet Union many of whom had spent time in Communist prisons on account of their faith that my desire to serve the Lord through evangelism took root.”In 1999 Nick enrolled in St. John’s College in Annapolis MD where he began to search for a deeper experience of the Holy Spirit and Christian community. Fluent in Russian he had explored a call to the missions in Russia through an internship with a group of charismatic Russian Orthodox Christians. But he ultimately found what he was looking for in South Bend where the rest of the family had established a stateside home so Claire could attend Trinity School. “When I moved to South Bend the South Bend branch found me a place to live a job and a role playing guitar at the Campus Fellowship meetings. I was amazed to find men who were both spiritual and practical and I realized i wanted to be like them.” He enrolled at Notre Dame was baptized in the Spirit and joined the community in February 2001.The next two years were pivotal. Nick took a break from school and began working for the community absorbing our way of thinking from Paul DeCelles and Mary Frances Sparrow. He later returned to Notre Dame and graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA. In February 2002 following the 2001 High Country Adventure Paul sent Nick Sean and J-T on a three-week road trip to seek out a location where high school students could work in the summer. They eventually found Allendale which became the site of the first Action summer later that year.Nick soon became a leader in the movement of young people who were working to contribute to the community through city-building. He helped lead the first household of single men and women in Allendale in 2004 before moving to the Twin Cities to help with the campus division in Dinkytown. He led and helped found the Company a group of young men who commit themselves to being trained and deployed for the mission work of the community.In 2007 Craig Lent appointed Nick as the community’s Mission program coordinator and Nick became a founding member of a new group of People of Praise missionaries the Missionary Company who live together in households and embrace poverty for the sake of the gospel. Nick moved to Indianapolis and later to Evansville helping to launch new starts in both locations. In 2011 he made a commitment to be single for the Lord for the sake of the community’s mission work. He was elected to the board of governors in 2014.Nick plays the guitar and banjo and enjoys writing songs from playful ditties about the small towns he’s encountered on his travels to hymn lyrics for the missionary choir.“Nick’s missionary background and fervor for evangelism his deep understanding of household life and his experience building Christian community are all tremendous assets for our life” Craig says. “He is also an excellent musician.”Paul DeCelles adds “Nick together with his companions has taken the community to a new frontier the Gospel to the poor.”
20201005014921,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6160,Nov. 8 2017 11:10 p.m.,People of Praise: Hard to Understand and That’s OK,A People of Praise community barbecue in Shreveport Louisiana. Click here to see our response to the most recent press attention we have been receiving. By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. A Broad OutreachIn recent years the People of Praise is perhaps best known as the founder of Trinity Schools three junior high/high schools which between them have won eight Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. For more than 35 years our schools have had a reputation for encouraging students to ask questions engage in spirited dialogue and draw their own reasoned conclusions. “I know of no better school in these United States” the late political philosopher Russell Kirk said of our flagship school in South Bend IN. Then there is our missionary work. Over the past 15 years the People of Praise has sent more than 100 people to live in some of America’s forgotten corners—places like Ms. Anderson’s Shreveport neighborhood where the per capita income is under $14000. There we and our neighbors have built and renovated homes run summer camps for thousands and started an elementary school for our neighborhood Praise Academy at Lakeside. In Evansville IN a group of People of Praise missionaries moved into two houses at a notorious intersection a place locals called “the devil’s corner” because of all the fights and drug deals. We didn’t arrive with any program or magic formula but hoped to encounter neighbors in a spirit of Christian friendship. Even so our neighbors have told us that crime has dropped off significantly because of the community we and they are building. “Every night there would be something bad going on and the police would have to park and just watch everybody” one long-time Evansville resident said. “It’s just remarkable how things have changed.”  On another front our community life provides a natural support for marriages and families and this has led us to develop Marriage in Christ a five-week course that equips couples to pray together and build crucial habits of conversation. More than 1000 couples have completed the program.Our RootsThe People of Praise has some of its roots in the Pentecostal revival that grew from a group of poor African Americans in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. Those humble believers experienced a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewal of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues. They were ridiculed in the press called “fanatics” and mocked for their lively worship. But the revival went on to inspire half a billion people including millions of Roman Catholics. The People of Praise also has roots in the Cursillo an evangelistic movement founded in Spain by Catholic laymen in the 1940s which spread to Mexico and the United States influencing some of our founding members. In 1971 after nearly seven years spent praying and studying the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers 29 people made a covenant commitment to put their lives and their futures in common. The People of Praise was born. Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage. Imperfect words will eventually fade but we remain happy and proud to be the category-defying community God has called us to be his People of Praise.   Sean Connolly (@sconnoll) is the communications director for the People of Praise community.

20201005052114,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6066,Sept. 6 2017 11:01 a.m.,Ecumenism Highlighted During Celebration of 50th Anniversary of Charismatic Renewal,by Elizabeth Pease Photo: Elizabeth Pease Thirty thousand people from 128 countries came to Rome in June to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Catholic charismatic renewal and I got to be one of them. I traveled there with Angie Hass (Mission Indianapolis) and met up with community members from Colorado Springs Indianapolis and Servant Branch. I know there were brothers and sisters from Buffalo and Appleton there too. I’d heard that Pope Francis had wanted the celebration to have an ecumenical emphasis and it was moving to see many signs of a renewed interest in unity. On Thursday sitting on the marble floors of stunning Byzantine and Renaissance churches I heard stories of ecumenism. Giovanni Traettino an Italian Pentecostal shared about washing the feet of a Catholic after years of tense relations between Catholics and Pentecostals in Italy. Charles Whitehead a friend of Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan (South Bend) described a long process of regular meetings and conversations among the leaders of all of the Christian churches in his English village. On Friday morning I attended a panel discussion on ecumenism in a lecture hall designed to seat about 200. It started late. The emcee came to the microphone and explained that there were 2000 people waiting outside. “We didn’t anticipate how much interest there would be in this topic” she said. The conference culminated in two long evenings spent outdoors at the Circus Maximus. Everywhere I looked there was some new expression of joy—a young man standing on his chair with hands raised and tears streaming down his face nuns in white habits forming a dance line a row of Brazilian teenagers yelling out “Viva Brasil!” A highlight came on Friday night when a video about the origins of the Catholic charismatic renewal played on the JumboTron. I looked up and suddenly Kevin and Dorothy appeared on the screen 20 feet tall. Though the Ranaghans had been unable to come to Rome in the flesh God found a way to bring them there that was truly larger than life. On Saturday night Pope Francis joined us raising his hands in praise. “[The Catholic charismatic renewal] was born ecumenical” he said. “It was born ecumenical because it is the Holy Spirit who creates unity and the same Spirit who granted the inspiration for this.” He added “Today Christian unity is more urgent than ever Christians united by the power of the Holy Spirit in prayer and in activity on behalf of the most vulnerable.” Visiting Assisi after the conference we were walking back to the hotel when I said “Praise the Lord!” Unexpectedly “Praise the Lord!” echoed back from a man sitting on the steps of a nearby building. We were soon in a conversation about ecumenism with a small group of Catholic Jamaicans from New York City. I explained that as a charismatic even though I’m Catholic I think that of some of my spiritual heritage comes from Christians of other denominations. Without some of the Pentecostal revivals in the United States in the last century the Catholic Charismatic Renewal would not exist. My new Jamaican friend shook his head and smiled. “You’re blowin’ my mind sister!”

20201006123907,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=4730,May 27 2015 4:07 p.m.,Cardinal George and the People of Praise,Story by Sean Connolly.Photo by Adam-Bielawski via WikiMediaCommons. Pope Francis is known for his openness to the Spirit his emphasis on evangelism and his embrace of evangelical Protestants and Pentecostals. A little-known story about Cardinal Francis George who died on April 17 reveals that he too was open to the Spirit and to graces from other Christian denominations. The story starts in 1990 after Bishop George was appointed to lead the diocese of Yakima Washington. There he met Fr. Perron Auve a diocesan priest who became his vicar general. Auve was a charismatic Catholic and a leader in the People of Praise a community of families and single people from many Christian denominations. The People of Praise grew from the charismatic renewal that swept through the Catholic Church in the late 1960s and ‘70s until it had impacted 36 percent of U.S. Catholics. Auve described the People of Praise to George and put him in touch with Paul DeCelles the community’s overall coordinator. He also introduced George to Joel Kibler a layman who is the head of the Brotherhood a group of men in the People of Praise who live lives of dedicated celibacy. Because the People of Praise is a predominantly lay and ecumenical community its leaders had to face questions about how they would relate to ordained ministers. DeCelles one of the 29 founders had discussed this with fellow founder Kevin Ranaghan before the community began in 1971. In 1981 DeCelles and Kibler had talked about finding a way for Brotherhood members who felt a call to the Catholic priesthood to receive ordination. This was a complicated situation. Catholic priests in the Brotherhood would need to be able to live in households with brothers who were Presbyterian Pentecostal or Baptist. As covenanted members of the People of Praise the priests would have made permanent commitments to a community which according to its foundational documents could have a Protestant as its overall coordinator. While pursuing a path for community members to be ordained DeCelles Auve Kibler and others had consulted canon lawyers and approached four US Catholic bishops. All four had passed on the idea but George took a different view. DeCelles says George was warm to the idea from the start. In a later meeting George said to Kibler “What you want to do is from the Holy Spirit. You have something to tell the Church.” George himself already had a deep understanding of community from his experience in the Oblates of Mary Immaculate—he had been vicar general of the order for 12 years and had traveled the world visiting missionary Oblate communities. “He understood community life more than most other bishops” as Auve recalls. In June of 1991 George attended a People of Praise prayer meeting in South Bend Indiana the community’s headquarters where he also met with a small group of community leaders. During the meeting George expressed his admiration for the way that the Brotherhood paid all their expenses from a single checking account—living in common the way the first Christians had done. With George’s encouragement DeCelles Kibler and several others continued the slow and difficult work of crafting the constitutions and statutes that would establish the Brotherhood as a Private Association of the Faithful within the Catholic Church. Fr. William Woestman a canon lawyer and Oblate whom George had recommended also assisted them. Kibler recalls sitting across a desk from George in 1996 while they read through a draft of the constitutions. George had been positive on the draft but he expressed disapproval after reading the section which had described how the Brotherhood could have Catholic and Protestant members. “He told me that I had to insert a sentence that said that the consciences of Protestants would be respected” Kibler recalls. In George’s view the Church was changing. Protestants could be part of a canonically-established Catholic association but they had to be assured that the Catholic members would not pressure them to convert. George recommended looking at the Declaration on Religious Freedom from Vatican II (Dignitatis Humanae 2) for inspiration. After he had been appointed Archbishop of Portland George invited the men of the Brotherhood to move there and in 1996 a few Brotherhood members began attending Mt. Angel Seminary. Archbishop John Vlazny George’s successor in Portland formally approved the Brotherhood’s statutes in 1999 and since that time four Brotherhood members have been ordained as priests. In 2014 Pope Francis appointed one of them Peter Smith as the auxiliary bishop of Portland Oregon. Bishop Smith who also knew George personally said of him “He was very open to new movements and the movement of the Holy Spirit within the Church. He was very forward- thinking while being firmly anchored in Church teaching. The whole notion of him being this arch conservative is so wrong. We are part of a lay ecclesial movement with an ecumenical dimension and he took a very positive position—the Holy Spirit is at work here so we need to be open to the Spirit.” This article also appears on The Anchoress.
20201006231120,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6126,Sept. 24 2020 8:38 a.m.,The Three Last Words of Bill Kenney,Bill worked as a security guard at Visitation School for 17 years.. by Elizabeth Pease Photos: Courtesy of Dorothy Kenney; Anne Kane; Robert Cunningham Photoresource. Editor's Note: This article was originally published on Nov. 3 2017. On a frigid Wednesday last December hundreds gathered for a funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul packing the center section of one of the largest churches in the United States. Some circled the downtown blocks near the cathedral looking for parking and eventually gave up and went home.Outside the mailman asked at the rectory what was going on and the hired motorcycle escort asked the funeral director how he’d gotten such a large event. As the gospel was read a man wearing a bandanna and carrying a backpack came in the side door and walked across the front of the cathedral. On a day with a high temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind chill well below zero he wore sandals with white socks and white pants. While the crowd stood in their pews he walked right up to the casket at the front of the church bent down and kissed it. Then he walked down the center aisle and out the door. Later as the casket was carried out of the cathedral 12th-grade girls from Visitation School wearing white gloves teared up as they lined the aisle. The school declared a day off in his honor. Who was this man loved by so many? He was a security guard. He was a realtor who had once fallen deeply into debt. He wasn’t a rich man or a famous personality. He was Bill Kenney and above all as his son Fr. Kevin Kenney explained in his homily at the cathedral he had three words that he wanted said at his funeral: “Jesus Jesus Jesus.”* * *In the early 1970s Bill Kenney was a hardworking husband and father in the throes of growing a small business. Kenney Realty had three offices in the Twin Cities and 40 licensed realtors. Bill put in long hours showing homes but he still found time to take his seven kids water-skiing. He bought a beautiful large home for his family near Lake Harriet in South Minneapolis. He loved to talk and meet new people he loved a good joke and he loved his wife Dorothy often bringing flowers home for her along with the groceries. He had learned his work ethic early. His father died when Bill was 16 and Bill had taken on two jobs to help support a family of 11 mostly younger siblings. His son Kevin recalls “From the minute we could walk we had to have a job of some sort oftentimes just in his real estate office. I remember as a little kid emptying wastebaskets and vacuuming and cleaning.”  Students at Visitation School lined up as an honor guard for his funeral at the Cathedral of St. Paul. In the fall of 1973 Dorothy’s life changed when she decided to attend a weekend introduction to the charismatic renewal put on by their parish. At the retreat Anna Brombach a fellow mother Dorothy knew from church came over to pray with her. Dorothy remembers “I looked down and it wasn’t Anna’s hand taking mine. It was Jesus’ hand. I got home the next day and I was so on fire.” A full turkey dinner was Bill’s favorite thing to cook and he had one waiting for Dorothy when she came home from the retreat. As the kids started washing the dishes after the meal Bill and Dorothy went for a walk around Lake Harriet. Dorothy recalls “I’m jumping and dancing and I said ‘Would you ever go to a prayer meeting with me?’ He said ‘Oh Dorothy. You’ve always been joyful. What’s such a big deal about this? You go to the prayer meeting. I sure as heck don’t want to go.’” For two and a half years Dorothy went to the prayer meetings alone. Then in 1976 Jim Cahill caught Bill and Dorothy as they were leaving mass and mentioned that Bishop Lucker a friend of Bill’s would be at the prayer meeting that night. As Dorothy remembers Jim said “Bill why don’t you come?” and Bill said “Maybe I will.” “I nearly fainted away” Dorothy recalls. At the end of the prayer meeting that night Bill greeted Bishop Lucker. Says Dorothy “The bishop said ‘Bill Kenney! What are you doing here?’ Bill said ‘I don’t come to these things. My wife does’ and Bishop Lucker said ‘You come back five times and then decide if you’re ever going to come again.’ Well Bill obeyed him and he never stopped coming.”* * *Bill quickly became involved in the charismatic renewal attending conferences and praying with people. He and Dorothy joined the growing covenant community in the Twin Cities that would eventually become Servant Branch. Bill insisted that his teenage children attend charismatic conferences and all seven of them were eventually prayed with for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Bill started asking for the Lord’s help in the details of his life. Kevin recalls him praying over broken washing machines as well as his response to car troubles on a road trip. “I think the block cracked in the car. He says ‘We have to pray over it and it’ll get fixed.’ That was his faith.” Many of Bill’s friends recall him counting how many times priests mentioned the name “Jesus” in their Sunday homilies so that he could encourage them later to get their numbers up.  The Cathedral of St. Paul Bill’s parish and the site of his funeral. This shift in Bill’s focus impacted his business life too. By the late 1970s with the economy struggling it became clear that Kenney Realty was overextended. The company and therefore Bill as its owner had fallen hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt. Many years later Bill told the story to the Twin Cities Catholic charismatic renewal: “Because of my finances I decided I needed help. I received the Holy Spirit in my life and got serious about getting out of debt. I always made decisions to do things and then I asked God to bless it but now I was asking God’s opinion as to what I was doing.” Bill started referring to Kenney Realty as a Christian business and instituted an optional daily morning prayer at the office. In 1979 Bill brought in some community members with business experience to form a board of directors for Kenney Realty. Robert Regan who worked in investment counseling and served on the board recalls Bill asking for help with the administrative side of the business. “He was always gregarious a great salesman not as good as an administrator and manager or financial guy.” Good advice from brothers and a demand for houses that came from groups of brothers and sisters moving to the Twin Cities to join the community (from North Dakota Iowa and Washington) kept the business growing for a few years until another economic downturn in the early 1980s. Also in 1979 Bill and Dorothy began a process of downsizing that would continue into the 1990s. Dorothy remembers “To get out of debt he never filed for bankruptcy but he said ‘We have to sell the big house.’ “Dorothy loved their block because they were surrounded by at least eight other large community families and the Kenneys used their house to host morning prayer for the neighborhood but they left it behind for a smaller place on Minnehaha Parkway. Bill’s eye for real estate showed in the deal: the new house was more affordable but still in a lovely spot. Three years later Bill told Dorothy that they would need to sell the smaller house and rent something. To Bill’s surprise the first thing Dorothy asked about was curtains. “I said ‘If you rent a house you don’t want to put fancy curtains in there.’ Of all the crazy things for me to say but that’s what was on my heart at the time.” Soon after that Bill and Dorothy went to look at a condo at the Commodore an old converted hotel in St. Paul. The owner reported “We furnished the whole place and I just spent $10000 on window treatments.” They moved in and eventually bought the condo. Bill set up a small office downstairs where he kept Kenney Realty running as a smaller and smaller business until it finally disbanded in the 1990s when Bill went to work as a realtor for another firm.  Dorothy Kenney stands in front of a photo of herself and Bill on their wedding day two days after he returned from Korea. They were married 62 years. Finally in 1999 a confluence of events ended Bill’s remaining debt for good. Both a community member and a minister Bill had borrowed from separately decided to forgive him those large debts. A year or two earlier Bill and Dorothy had thought about selling the condo to move into a smaller apartment across the street from the Cathedral of St. Paul but it hadn’t sold. Then another apartment opened up in the same building so they put the condo on the market again and it sold for $20000 more than the original listing. Dorothy says “Bill always said ‘God dumped $20000 in my lap.’ So totally totally totally out of debt we started over.” Robert remembers “Bill had been living an upper-middle-class life and he made the transition to less money. He had to change dramatically. He made the transition just no problem at all. He trusted the Lord and never had a depressed day as far as I recall. The Lord let him down very gently step by step and gradually out of debt.” In the midst of all this Bill was busy for the Lord too. He was in Christians in Commerce. He was on the board of DeLaSalle High School his alma mater. He was chairman of the Catholic charismatic renewal in the Twin Cities. He and Dorothy joined the cathedral parish in St. Paul and Bill volunteered to run the men’s club pancake breakfasts. He was also constantly engaged in his favorite pastime talking to people about Jesus. Mark Lauer Bill’s head remembers going out to lunch with Bill. “He would get to know the waiter or waitress by name and a little bit about the person’s story. If any need came up he would say ‘I’ll pray for you.’” Bill and Robert played golf together regularly and sometimes they would pair off with a couple of golfers they didn’t know. Robert says “No matter who we were playing golf with Bill would somehow bring the Lord into the conversation: ‘Do you know the Lord? Are you going to church?’ A lot of people would say ‘I quit going 25 years ago.’ He’d tell them ‘You gotta get back in touch.’”* * *Around the year 2000 Bill took a newly created job as a security guard at Visitation School a Catholic school of about 600 students in Mendota Heights. Visitation starts with pre-K and the older students in grades six to twelve are all girls. Bill arrived in the afternoons and stayed to close the building at night watching the security cameras greeting visitors and walking the last few girls to their cars after dark. He discovered that the parking lot was a little chaotic in the afternoon with students crossing the street at the same time that vehicles needed to leave so he started coming in earlier to direct traffic sometimes in a funny winter hat.  A blanket from Visitation sits on Bill’s favorite recliner. Rene Gavic the head of school at Visitation remembers “He was the go-to person. He knew everything. He had keys for everything. He was a good problem-solver so if someone’s car wouldn’t start they would go to Bill first. He cared about you and would help you and support you in any way.” Bill noticed when the students were having difficulties. Mary McClure who teaches religion at Visitation recalls “He would ask ‘Would you like me to pray with you?’ He waited until he knew there was an opening. Sometimes girls would share a healing: they needed to run and they’d had an injury so Bill prayed and they were able to participate the next day.” Rene adds a story about her own daughter at Visitation. “When she was 12 she fell in a cross-country race and other runners stepped on her face with their spiked shoes. She needed 22 stitches in her face. As a 12-year-old girl that was challenging for her. I remember her coming to school the very first day back and what she wanted to do was have Mr. Kenney pray with her. He prayed with her and her situation and her self-image–all of that–never bothered her again.” At Visitation Bill developed a strategy for generosity. Once a month the students give one dollar to charity for permission to be out of uniform for the day. Bill dropped by the campus minister’s office on the day she collected the dollars and exchanged larger bills for her pile of ones. “In one of his pockets he had a little vial of oil to pray with people and in the other pocket he had maybe twenty single ones. That would be for the kids whose dollar got stuck in the vending machines” Mary remembers. Those ones also often made their way into the hands of the homeless.  Bill as St. Nicholas at his church in 2015. There’s no way to know for sure if the man who kissed his casket at the funeral knew Bill but we can be quite sure that Bill would have cared about him if he had ever met him on the street. In his later years Bill’s friends remember him always going up to homeless people standing on corners telling them that Jesus loved them and giving them one or two dollars for a cup of coffee. That human contact was important to him. Bill’s son Kevin adds that he would also offer a dollar or two when someone at the grocery store didn’t have enough to pay. “I think it was because people had helped him when he was in a time of need. It became a way of life for him” Kevin recalls.* * *On December 4 2016 Bill stayed after church at the cathedral to play St. Nicholas for the children while Dorothy went home. As he was leaving he fell on the sidewalk outside and a passerby called 911. He’d had a stroke and died within a few days. For Christmas Dorothy and the Kenney family gathered at the home of one of her daughters. Bill had dressed as Santa Claus for many years and Santa Claus wasn’t there that year. Dorothy’s kids coaxed her to the front door of the house. Dorothy recalls “Out the front door they had all these jars with candles in them spelling out ‘Jesus’ on the front lawn. It was so beautiful because Bill preached Jesus. I mean he preached Jesus preached preached Jesus.”

Over the past several years People of Praise members have been converting vacant city lots and their own backyards into gardens with the aim of providing fresh food for their neighborhood. This year to date the farm has grown over 6000 lbs of produce. Among the harvest: garlic onions swiss chard spinach tomatoes eggplant carrots green beans black eyed peas okra sweet potatoes cucumbers watermelon zinnias and most beloved by the neighborhood greens--collard mustard and turnip. Most of the yield goes to a farm stand that Praise Harvest runs every Saturday morning throughout the growing season on the corner of one of their farm lots. There's no cost for the produce though there's a suggested donation of $1/lb for people who can afford it.   The farmers consult with their neighbors about food they’d like to see grown. Early on there were resounding requests for greens which continue to be by far the most popular item. “We regularly run out of greens” says farm manager John Earhart. Last season the farm grew 3800 lbs of greens alone.  When the farm stand opens at 9am there are typically 10 or 12 cars already lined up waiting. The team that sells the vegetables has developed a system that allows for social distancing and safe transactions.  But the farm stand has proven to be a gathering place for the neighborhood especially during the pandemic. Neighbors come for fresh produce and stick around to visit and catch up. “I think people are really happy just to have an opportunity to be together” says Nick Holovaty.  To learn more about Praise Harvest visit https://www.facebook.com/praiseharvestfarm.

Below is an explication of the covenant which Paul gave at the 1976 covenant-making community meeting in South Bend. At the end of the talk Paul read the covenant aloud. You may notice that it differs slightly from the version we use today. In January 1986 the board of governors approved two revisions to the covenant. The first is that the word “basic” was omitted to avoid confusion with other unrelated groups known as “basic communities.” The second is that the word “Church” was made lowercase to better reflect the diversity of our various denominations. We hope that reading and discussing this will deepen your appreciation of what the Lord has called us to.  Barb Potts (right) congratulates Audrey Rebar on making the covenant in Corvallis on October 15.

20201008044244,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”
20201008061742,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6160,Nov. 8 2017 11:10 p.m.,People of Praise: Hard to Understand and That’s OK,A People of Praise community barbecue in Shreveport Louisiana. Click here to see our response to the most recent press attention we have been receiving. By Sean Connolly Ms. Dorothy Anderson is an African American woman in her mid-seventies and a long-time resident of Shreveport Louisiana. Recently she found herself deeply moved at a neighborhood barbecue hosted by the People of Praise community. “In almost all of his speeches Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see it but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.” Her words resonated particularly since residents of her neighborhood had long suffered under the scourge of racism and Dr. King himself had spoken twice at the Galilee Baptist Church just a few blocks away. For the People of Praise Ms. Anderson’s words strike an even deeper chord. Recently our community was subject to scrutiny in the mainstream press to reports that contained both inaccuracies and misunderstandings. We want to respond and explain who we are but in doing so we would not want our own words to fall short of the high standard Jesus sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount. We forgive those who have wronged us and we pray for them. We also take the long view. Testimonies like Ms. Anderson’s matter more to us and resonate far more deeply than even positive reports in the media. We know from Scripture that on the day when Christ is all in all stories like Ms. Anderson’s will weigh heavily on the scales.Who are the People of Praise?We are an ecumenical charismatic covenant community. Our model and inspiration is the first Christian community a small band of disciples who “were of one heart and soul” and “held all things in common.” (Acts 4:33 2:44). We can be difficult for the public and the press to understand. In truth we are a community that defies categories. Take our ecumenism. A majority of People of Praise members are Catholic and yet the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our teachings which we hold in common. Defying categories is not necessarily a disadvantage. Our members include teachers carpenters and cooks security guards and judges laity and ordained clergy singles and married couples. We are a community for the rich and we are a community for the poor. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. A Broad OutreachIn recent years the People of Praise is perhaps best known as the founder of Trinity Schools three junior high/high schools which between them have won eight Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. For more than 35 years our schools have had a reputation for encouraging students to ask questions engage in spirited dialogue and draw their own reasoned conclusions. “I know of no better school in these United States” the late political philosopher Russell Kirk said of our flagship school in South Bend IN. Then there is our missionary work. Over the past 15 years the People of Praise has sent more than 100 people to live in some of America’s forgotten corners—places like Ms. Anderson’s Shreveport neighborhood where the per capita income is under $14000. There we and our neighbors have built and renovated homes run summer camps for thousands and started an elementary school for our neighborhood Praise Academy at Lakeside. In Evansville IN a group of People of Praise missionaries moved into two houses at a notorious intersection a place locals called “the devil’s corner” because of all the fights and drug deals. We didn’t arrive with any program or magic formula but hoped to encounter neighbors in a spirit of Christian friendship. Even so our neighbors have told us that crime has dropped off significantly because of the community we and they are building. “Every night there would be something bad going on and the police would have to park and just watch everybody” one long-time Evansville resident said. “It’s just remarkable how things have changed.”  On another front our community life provides a natural support for marriages and families and this has led us to develop Marriage in Christ a five-week course that equips couples to pray together and build crucial habits of conversation. More than 1000 couples have completed the program.Our RootsThe People of Praise has some of its roots in the Pentecostal revival that grew from a group of poor African Americans in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. Those humble believers experienced a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewal of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues. They were ridiculed in the press called “fanatics” and mocked for their lively worship. But the revival went on to inspire half a billion people including millions of Roman Catholics. The People of Praise also has roots in the Cursillo an evangelistic movement founded in Spain by Catholic laymen in the 1940s which spread to Mexico and the United States influencing some of our founding members. In 1971 after nearly seven years spent praying and studying the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers 29 people made a covenant commitment to put their lives and their futures in common. The People of Praise was born. Two of our founding members Kevin and Dorothy Ranaghan played a pivotal role spreading the Pentecostal revival among Catholics where it became known as “charismatic renewal.” The People of Praise ran many large conferences including the 1977 conference in Kansas City’s Arrowhead stadium that was perhaps the largest ecumenical gathering in modern times. Cardinal Leo Suenens one of the Second Vatican Council’s leading voices spoke to the crowd of 50000 as did Bishop Ithiel Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ. This grassroots ecumenism has continued under Pope Francis who last year invited all charismatics to Rome where he joined them in prayer and song to celebrate with Catholics Protestants and Pentecostals the 50th anniversary of the charismatic renewal in the Catholic Church. Another Francis the late Cardinal Francis George of Chicago helped the Brotherhood of the People of Praise a group of men who live lives of dedicated celibacy to obtain official status as a private association of the faithful. For years some of the men in the Brotherhood had felt a call to become Catholic priests creating a complicated situation given that some of their brothers might be Lutheran or Pentecostal. Cardinal George championed their cause. “In my acquaintance with the People of Praise” the cardinal wrote “I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Lay LeadershipAfter a long period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a lifelong commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God. This covenant is not an oath or a vow. We have understood that God can always call a person to another way of life in which case he or she would be released from the covenant. People of Praise members agree to accept practical advice and spiritual direction from other qualified community members a practice which has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Two of our members recently published a book on the Spiritual Exercises called Burning with Love for God. Freedom of conscience is a key to our diversity. People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. We may not always be easy to understand but that’s OK with us. We would never want to trade our birthright for positive attention or compromise the very qualities which are our only God-given advantage. Imperfect words will eventually fade but we remain happy and proud to be the category-defying community God has called us to be his People of Praise.   Sean Connolly (@sconnoll) is the communications director for the People of Praise community.

Burning with Love for God: A Guide to the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius written by People of Praise members Paul DeCelles and Mary Frances Sparrow and published in 2016 was recently reviewed in the Journal of Jesuit Studies by Francis X. McAloon S.J. McAloon writes ""I recommend this unique yet wholly orthodox approach to the Spiritual Exercises. Those outside the charismatic community will benefit from reviewing the Spirtitual Exercises from this perspective.""¹ Burning with Love for God is addressed to all who want to “live and move and have their being as God’s friend” and presents the Spiritual Exercises as a proven method for growing in love and forging friendship with God.  The topics covered in the book which include discernment of spirits decision-making personal prayer and making meditations on the life of Christ are all taken up in a careful and clear way that represents the fruit of the authors’ patient scholarship and many years of experience as directors of the Spiritual Exercises. “Paul and Mary Frances have given us a wonderful and profound gift in this deep guide” said Craig Lent. Peter Smith the auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon offered this endorsement: ""Pope Francis has spoken many times about the importance of discernment of finding and following God’s will of discovering what the Holy Spirit is doing in our times . . .

20201008114736,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8155,Sept. 15 2020 4:28 p.m.,Wildfires Burn in Oregon and Washington,"By Sean Connolly Jim McDowell (Corvallis) recalls the weekends and summers he spent at a cabin his family built amid towering hemlock trees on the north fork of Oregon's Santiam River. Starting from age 12 he helped clear the land and learned to spot Chinook salmon in the river. Over time he came to treasure the cabin as ""a place where you can step away from the world and see God face to face in the quiet.”  The cabin is gone now—burned in the Beachie Creek Fire. Beachie Creek is one of several conflagrations that swept down from the Cascade Mountains towards the heavily populated Willamette Valley home to the community's Corvallis and Vancouver/Portland branches. Energized by high winds it destroyed several small towns and scorched 190000 acres. Closer to Portland the Riverside Fire has burned 134000 acres while the Holiday Farm Fire southeast of Corvallis has burned 166000 acres.   Jim McDowell's family cabin burned in the Beachie Creek Fire.

As of Monday in Oregon 10 people have died from the fires and 22 are reported missing according to the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. The winds have died down for now allowing firefighters a chance to contain the fires. Dry conditions persist but there is rain in the forecast this week. Corvallis itself after experiencing fiery-orange skies and ash falling like a light snow for several days last week is now shrouded in a dense grey fog. The closest fire is 45 or 50 miles away by road and the city is not in immediate danger. All branch members and their houses are safe and yet life is hardly normal. ""We haven't seen the sun in over a week"" Principal Branch Coordinator Phil Monaco noted on Monday morning. ""There are hardly any sounds. Everything is stopped.”  The skies over Corvallis Oregon last week. Photo by Phil Monaco. With their air quality registering in the ""hazardous"" to ""very unhealthy"" ranges according to a U.S. government website branch members are largely staying indoors with their windows closed. The city hasn't picked up the trash in more than a week. Parks are closed. Tom Melton runs a road paving business but can't pave any roads since the asphalt plants are shut down. Tim and Mary Jo Wagner welcomed their son and his young family from Salem Oregon into their home since the Wagners have a good air-filtration system. Geoff and Nancy Myers bought pet food and cleaning supplies and took them to a dropoff point for delivery to evacuees staying at the fairgrounds. Jean Monaco has four cousins who live outside Vida Oregon near the heart of the Holiday Farm Fire. Two lost their homes and she is waiting to hear about the home of a third cousin. Bryan Thompson and his family have been going for decades to a private campground called Taylor Park in Lyons Oregon. They rent a space and have access to it year-round. Bryan says they were there on Labor Day weekend and knew the Beachie Creek Fire was nearby but the winds normally blow to the east so they were not concerned. After they left the winds blew west. “We have heard that all the structures are completely burned” he said. Eighty miles north of Corvallis Portland currently has the worst air quality of any major city in the world according to a report in The New York Times. The closest large fire the Riverside Fire is about 30 miles southeast of downtown Portland. It’s not currently threatening Portland but that could change with a strong westerly wind.  A view of downtown Portland on Saturday September 12. Photo by Lena Glover. ""As soon as you get outside it smells like a campfire” says Principal Branch Coordinator Charlie Fraga. ""Kids can’t go outside and play. It’s tough.”  He adds “Just like with the pandemic people in Portland are adapting to the new situation. You have a smile on your face and you’re praising God all the while.”  As in Corvallis branch members keep their windows shut to keep out the bad air and ash. Kathy Bucheit spoke about sealing cracks with towels and blankets to keep out the ash and the acrid smell. Her nephew is a firefighter battling the fires in Clackamas County just east of Portland where the Riverside Fire is raging. Another nephew in Clackamas had to evacuate. She said she hasn’t gone outside for more than three days except briefly to check the mail. Sunday’s Vancouver-Portland branch meeting was supposed to be held outdoors in small groups but instead took place on Zoom. The meeting included a time of praise and a sharing from branch member Toby Clairmont an emergency preparedness expert on how to create a “go kit” in case branch members need to flee as well as conversation about reaching out to neighbors and intercessory prayer.  A view of the Kenton neighborhood in North Portland. Photo by Charlie Fraga. Similarly at the branch meeting in Corvallis “We spent a good part of our time praying for the fire victims and that the Lord just put the fires out and that we get rain. We really need rain” Phil said. They added prayers for an end to the pandemic for peace amid the social unrest in Portland and for a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit. At their house in Battle Ground Washington Toby Clairmont and his wife Susie have their truck and RV ready to go in case they need to evacuate. They are about 20 miles from the Big Hollow Fire which has burned 20000 acres. Toby leads a volunteer team of amateur radio operators who are ready to help communicate evacuation orders to those living in hard-to-reach rural areas.   Ten or so miles away Jeff Lindberg says he has been able to see the sun through the smoke. “It looks like a full moon.” He adds “It’s been a drag for the kids lately because they want to go outside and play. For the most part we say 'No you can’t' but we let them play a bit yesterday [Monday]. For his part after losing his family’s cabin Jim McDowell says “I can see good coming out of it in the sense that for my family my brothers and sisters there’s an opportunity to bring us all together."" Charlie adds “With danger all around us we’re so grateful to God for protecting us. We ask everyone for prayers for rain for the safety of ourselves and our neighbors for those who have already suffered tragic personal loss for all of the firefighters and for a swift end to the wildfires."""
20201008171521,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=2278,Feb. 2 2012 11:07 a.m.,Abbie Teeter (South Bend),By Barbara Sahut  Abbie Teeter I first met my very good friend Abbie Teeter in San Francisco in the early 1970s when she drove several of us to a weekend retreat of John the Baptist Charismatic Renewal Community. We shared many memorable experiences in those days. The JBCRC Saturday evening prayer meetings were so crowded that some of the people would usually be sitting on the floor and after the meeting we’d go to someone’s home for Mass and then stay up talking till the early morning hours. In 1977 we both moved to South Bend to join the People of Praise. With over 100 others we headed cross-country leaving the people and places that we loved discovering God’s new plan for us. Abbie made the covenant September 24 1977 and in 1981 I purchased a home later known as Shalom House and invited Abbie and Luiza Freitas to move in with me. We really enjoyed living together in our household. Abbie was an inspiration because she had her personal prayer time around 5 a.m. before our 6 a.m. household prayer. She was always very practical and down to earth. She did my mending and I balanced her checking account a win/win situation. I can only remember being upset with her once. She mentioned at a household meeting that our outside plants needed “dusting.” I thought that was taking cleanliness too far! Who cared if the plants outside were dusty? Then Abbie patiently explained to Luiza and me (city girls) that you put dust on plants to keep bugs away. Abbie frequently spoke about her family so in the early 1980s the two of us took Abbie’s car with plenty of tapes on the Bible and visited her family in California. That was a great trip and we took several other vacations together. One Christmas we visited her son Jim and his family in California. One year we went to Branson Missouri. One year we went to Phoenix to visit friends and then to Snowflake AZ where Abbie’s son Bill lived. She also traveled to Germany Spain the Holy Land Rome and Guam. Abbie was born June 19 1917 on a homestead in Terry Montana and the Welliver family moved to Bismarck North Dakota when she was a child. She started work as a telephone operator after high school. Abbie and her husband Francis Teeter were married October 5 1936. During World War II Francis served in the Army so Abbie moved to the San Francisco Bay area where her parents had relocated. Abbie and Francis raised six children in the Bay area before divorcing in 1971. She is survived by five children 14 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. When Abbie moved to South Bend in 1977 she arrived with no prospect of a job but her long experience working for Pacific Bell led to a position with Indiana Bell and she worked there until her retirement. She was a union steward and held several management positions. The people she trained discovered that she wouldn’t settle for anything less than excellence and they responded accordingly. Abbie started the branch’s intercessory prayer vigil for widows and older single women. This was a monthly overnight vigil at the LaSalle Building to pray for the needs of the community and other needs we knew about. She always volunteered Shalom House to cook so everybody would have a great main meal. At a memorial luncheon at the branch center in South Bend on April 2 several of Abbie’s friends paid glowing tribute to her. Gwen DeLee remembered “For 11 months I accompanied Abbie on her visits for the St. Vincent De Paul Society. She was a great mentor. We visited the homes of the very very poor and I couldn’t get over how well she related to them. She amazed me. She was very direct very realistic and intent on helping them out in very practical ways. She had an immediate rapport with them. At that time Action division was developing programs to help people in society at large beyond the People of Praise. Through Abbie I saw that it was possible. We really could relate genuinely to people in dire need.” In 1985 when Action division started Home Management Services (now Home Management Resources) to teach women the practical skills of running a home Abbie was in the first group of counselors. In her HMS classes she taught sewing cooking and crafts and she was an excellent counselor one-on-one. “Intercessory prayer was a passion for Abbie” said Jackie Curran at the memorial service in the branch center. “She was a magnet for prayer intentions. She collected them from divisions areas and all the branches and kept them in a large box in alphabetical order. Sometimes our prayer vigil would take place on a football Saturday. Of course everybody knew Abbie absolutely loved Notre Dame football but the prayer vigil was more important. So the game would be showing on the TV right up until the minute we began the vigil then Abbie would click it off and we’d start singing “Spirit of the Living God.” When she shared this Jackie was wearing a jacket that Abbie had made for her. “When my son John said his first Mass in South Bend after ordination Abbie made the chasuble he wore. For years her scarves table covers and Christmas decorations were the hottest items in the branch’s Christmas bazaar benefiting Trinity School. “I was Abbie’s head when she was housebound because of health problems so I asked her how I could serve her. She didn’t want things for herself. She wanted me to visit Ethel Chalk at Providence House because Abbie herself couldn’t go. And she was very concerned that no one in Jo Geissler’s women’s group was able to visit her so she asked me to go instead. (No matter that we were having a severe snowstorm!) I felt privileged to be an extension of this marvelous woman in Christ.” Marylen Robinson recalled that Abbie taught the Girl Scouts in the branch to decorate Christmas cookies as well as making their uniform vests for them. Terry Paukert said “When I got married I didn’t have a lot of money so Abbie made my wedding dress.” Abbie’s generosity to the Trinity School scholarship fund enabled many students to attend who couldn’t have done so otherwise. In June 2006 she reluctantly left branch life in South Bend and moved back to California to live with her son Jim and his wife Mary Ellen who cared for her lovingly until she died January 11 2011 at the age of 93. Jim described his mother in a typical scene sitting by the fireplace with grandkids everywhere playing with their Star Wars toys. “Mom was grinning constantly the whole time the grandkids played there around her.” Betsy Cotter reminded us all of one of the key characteristics of this woman of God: “Abbie gave. She always looked around for needs she could fill. Despite the difficulties she faced in her life that familiar smile always returned quickly to her face. Today when we walk into the branch center in South Bend facing us on the opposite wall from the front door is a large picture of Jesus with a big smile on his face. That picture also is a gift from Abbie.”
20201009004120,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8182,Sept. 18 2020 4:07 p.m.,Mobile Dodges Bullet from Hurricane Sally,"Neighbor's tree lands on Mary Ellen Naylor's house. by Catherine Bulger Hurricane Sally blew through Mobile Alabama on Wednesday. Though most branch members lost power and many of their properties sustained minor damage—with fallen trees and shingles blown off brothers and sisters are praising God that everyone is safe. With a wind speed of 105 mph Sally made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane early Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores Alabama. Mobile is 40 miles northwest of Gulf Shores and sits at the north end of Mobile Bay which opens into the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately for Mobile the winds shifted slightly pushing water from Mobile Bay out towards the ocean instead of flooding the city.  The hurricane traveling at just two miles per hour stalled over the region for many hours. In Mobile lights began to flick out on Tuesday night and by Wednesday morning Alabama Power reported over 175000 customers without power in the area. Mobile ultimately received about five inches of rain and wind gusts of up to 82 mph according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile Orange Beach AL southeast of Mobile was deluged with nearly 30 inches as was Pensacola FL. “Mobile really dodged a bullet” said branch member Lydia Gaudet.   On Thursday after the storm had moved out and blue skies returned schools and many businesses remained closed. Majestic live oak trees lay uprooted in a historic town square. Myriad crews raced to restore power as quickly as possible and clear the streets of debris. The city imposed an overnight curfew to facilitate cleanup work.   Fallen leaves litter Steve and Lydia Gaudet's street.  Walter and Julia Drey's broken balcony railing. Walter and Julia Drey live on Dog River close to the bay. Their home is raised seven feet off the ground but it has flooded in past storms. Julia reported “The wonderful thing is that the river did not rise. The North wind actually blew the water out of the river so that was a real blessing.” The Dreys did have driving rain seep into the living room through cracks in the doors. They hurried around with towels mopping up water. “We set the alarm at night for every two hours to go around and check the house” she said. A lot of shingles blew off the roof so Walter put a tarp over it to prevent leaking. In the middle of the night the balcony railing finally gave way to the tree that had been beating on it continuously. “We’ve got a lot of yard cleaning up to do” said Julia “but my basic attitude is I’m very grateful it wasn’t worse.”  Mary Ellen Naylor lives with her sister and her adult son daughter and son-in-law. They lost electricity at 10:30 pm on Tuesday. At 3:30 am they heard the crack of the neighbors’ large oak tree followed by the crash as its branches landed on their roof breaking through in four places. Mary Ellen’s son-in-law went out later and cleared away as much tree as he could without the use of his electric chainsaw. He managed to get a tarp over most of the holes for now. “The rain was torrential at times a lot of it happening after dark. Trees were really whipping around” said Mary Ellen.  Branches poking through Mary Ellen's roof into the attic. “The worst part of a hurricane is the heat afterward” said Rose Denton. Bill and Rose Denton also lost power Tuesday night. It was hard to sleep after that especially for Rose and her mother (who lives with the Dentons). Rose was still off work but on Thursday Bill had gone out to the non profit camp he works at and spent the whole day doing cleanup on the property. The Dentons lost the awning over their kitchen door and part of their privacy fence. The cable line was down in the backyard.  Tony and Phyllis Compretta were getting ready on Thursday to put some of their food in Manny and Donna Ganzarain’s freezer since the Ganzarains have a generator. “Our street did look messy” said Phyllis “but people started coming out yesterday and cleaning up yards. There’s a lot of loose shingles. We can’t tell where they came from.” The Comprettas didn’t lose any large trees but Phyllis was mourning the loss of several smaller ornamentals including her crepe myrtle. “There was a lot more wind intensity than we realized it was going to be” she said. “It just went on for hours and hours and hours. I’m glad it wasn’t any worse.”  Steve and Lydia Gaudet also have a generator so they had something of an open door on Thursday with neighbors and grown children coming over to put milk and eggs in the refrigerator make coffee and charge cell phones. One of their children borrowed the camping stove and propane. “When you live here” said Lydia “you keep that stuff around.” “We’re so grateful that everyone is safe and that the damage wasn’t greater” said Mike Coney who is the coordinator from the branch relations council responsible for Mobile. “Please pray for the clean up effort in Mobile and especially for those in Alabama and Florida who sustained major flooding."""
20201009023921,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5837,May 17 2017 1:31 p.m.,Healy Group: Built on Little Things,"Healy Group owners (from left) Tony Nyers Rich Preuss Chris Rowland Matt Urbanski and Randy Raciti. by Sean Connolly Photos: Christin Rose Margaret Anderson With this article which tells the stories of Rich Preuss Randy Raciti Chris Rowland and Matt Urbanski (all South Bend) four of the owners of Healy Group we are beginning a series on entrepreneurs in the community. If you have a suggestion for a future story in this series please contact us at [email protected] ""You can be the best financial advisor in the world but if you don’t have a client it doesn’t matter. You’ll starve to death.” Rich Preuss a financial advisor and an owner of Healy Group in South Bend is telling me about the days when he cut his teeth as a salesman. In 1982 Rich was a young man with a master’s degree in theology who wanted to become a stockbroker. After Merrill Lynch rejected him Ed Healy a life insurance agent offered Rich a job. (Rich went on to marry Ed’s daughter Beth though Ed didn’t know about their budding relationship when he hired Rich.)   Rich Preuss The job involved lots of cold calling. “Ed gave me these 3x5 Dun & Bradstreet cards which listed a business its owner and the sales of the company and he said ‘Call these people.’” He aimed to make 50 calls each week. On the phone he would ask for a face-to-face meeting. If he got a yes he’d bring along an experienced salesman and listen to the pitch studying points of tension and connection. “Trying to get new clients is brutal psychologically” he says. “When I started out I probably thought about quitting every day for the first five years.” He put his hope in a formula—if he made 10 calls he could get two or three meetings and land one client. It was the spirit of Babe Ruth the baseball legend who set the record for home runs while simultaneously setting the record for strikeouts. “So much of building a business and getting clients comes down to what you do each day” he says. “It’s a matter of calling people and doing the little things. As the saying goes when you do the little things the big things take care of themselves.”***   Joe Cramer Built on the little things Healy Group is much larger today than it was in the 1980s—with 41 employees spread across four divisions. The life insurance work that Rich began with morphed into a broader financial planning division employing Rich Randy Raciti and Matt Urbanski plus community members Christin Rose Joe Cramer Linda Mooney and Claire Mysliwiec and five other employees. Chris Rowland leads a separate division with 12 employees focused on employee benefits. Another community member Tim Pingel works in the insurance division. The mortgage division is led by Mike Morin a Trinity School at Greenlawn parent.  Linda Mooney Growth did not come fast but it has accelerated recently. “It took us 23 years to get to 10 employees” says Randy Healy Group’s president noting that in 2015 the company added 10 employees in a single year. In 2014 they moved into their new 12000-square-foot office building which they designed with extra space so that growth can continue.  Pam Shultz *** Randy started at Healy in 1987. The son of a salesman and entrepreneur who died when Randy was 13 Randy always wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps as a businessman. But by 1987 his career had reached a turning point so he took a walk with Joel Kibler (Vancouver-Portland). “I have this sense that you and Rich Preuss should be working together” Joel told Randy who applied for a job at Healy. He started by selling employee benefits packages and helping individual clients with financial planning. Randy is a dogged worker—as a young man he would rise at 4:00 a.m. and work until midnight then get up and do it all over again. He’s also a born salesman. “I am very comfortable picking up the phone and introducing myself” he says. In 1990 Randy entered a leadership program and when the classes ended he contacted all 45 of his classmates. “Presidents of banks presidents of hospitals presidents of media companies— I contacted them all. I didn’t know any better. I was 29 years old so why not?” On the phone he would offer to take his prospect out to breakfast or lunch. Then over the meal Randy would spend most of the time perhaps 40 minutes listening to his prospect’s story waiting patiently until the final 10 minutes when he would tell his own story and offer his services. He and Rich were both aggressive about adding new clients. “One year we had a little personal competition for how many new people we could meet with in the course of a year and I think we both blew through the 200 new people mark” Randy says.  Claire Mysliwiec enjoyed a Dairy Queen Dilly Bar provided by Tim Pingel known for offering ice cream treats to his fellow employees. To help their clients Randy and Rich began using a software program to forecast the amount clients needed to save for retirement. Most appointments were outside the office so they would bring a 70- or 80-page printed report with scenarios and projections. Inevitably the client would want to alter the variables—to see the impact of saving more or working longer— so the advisor had to return to the office and rerun the numbers. “That created frustration for us and for the client” Rich says. Over time the software improved and Rich and Randy began meeting with clients at the Healy Group office where they could run projections on the spot. They also started using a more comprehensive planning process analyzing a client’s overall level of protection debt savings and investments. With a more complete picture they noticed ways to save the client money. By 1999 Randy’s efforts had begun to blossom and he wanted to go full-time as a financial planner. Enter Chris Rowland. *** Chris had been working in employee benefits since 1985 when he graduated from Notre Dame with his M.B.A. As an undergrad he had majored in philosophy but had developed an interest in business. In graduate school he first learned about the up-and-coming field of employee benefits. A young married man he saw a chance to do good for people while also providing for his family. He worked for two different companies in South Bend before joining Healy in 1999 to take over and eventually expand Randy’s employee benefits portfolio. “The mindset that we’re helping build the kingdom of God when we take care of people that we’ll go above and beyond the call of duty—that attracted me” Chris says. Employee benefits work has different rhythms from financial planning. Most of Chris’s clients are businesses—small companies nonprofits and larger corporations. Chris and his staff of 12 act as middle men between the companies who sell group health life and disability insurance packages and the companies providing insurance to their employees. They negotiate contracts offer ideas and answer questions. Health insurance costs are always rising and regulations changing so a lot of the work Chris and his team does is educational—teaching human resources departments about changes in the marketplace teaching employees about changes to their plans. “We want to work hard for our clients to make sure problems are resolved and that they can afford to offer health insurance to their employees” he says.  Employees at a monthly Fun & Fellowship Friday lunch in Healy’s community room. *** If phone calls and sales efforts are the skeleton of the business then faceto-face client meetings are the heart and soul. They are where the music happens where “we take on our clients’ problems as if they’re our own problems” as Chris puts it. Even if the problem is a flat tire. Healy Group employees like to tell the story of a client who rolled into the parking lot on just three good tires. Tim Pingel spotted the flat and in a meeting he and Rich were having with the client Tim asked the client for his keys. He asked at least twice before the surprised client agreed. Tim went out to the parking lot found the jack and spare raised up the metal hulk switched the tire then lowered the minivan back down to the ground while Rich finished meeting with the client.  Employees spiritedly entered into a Friday fun game: identifying fellow employees from their baby pictures. Matt Urbanski tells another story about driving to Bremen Indiana to visit an elderly couple he advises. On the way there he remembered that the husband loves chocolates so he decided to stop at a grocery store and buy some. Praying while he drove he asked the Lord what he thought. Much to Matt’s surprise the Lord prompted him to buy some paczkis instead. (Paczkis are a Polish pastry.) Matt showed up with the paczkis only to learn that the wife had been hankering for some all day. In fact when Matt had called earlier she thought about asking him to bring some but dismissed the idea as too trivial. Later Matt prayed with the husband for arthritis in his hands and the wife for neck pain. Both told him they experienced relief after his prayer. Matt is Healy’s newest owner. He started in 2000 but only after putting off the idea for several years. As a college student in the early 1990s he met with Rich to ask his advice about whether to major in finance or marketing. “I don’t think it matters” Rich told him “because we’ll hire you whatever you major in.” Matt chose marketing worked for a restaurant ownership group then led the development office at Holy Cross College. By 2000 he was ready to try insurance sales and financial planning. He says his first year at Healy did not go well at least by conventional measures. He worked harder than he ever had but he brought in less income than he had in his previous job. (Several years later someone told him that 90 percent of financial advisors quit in their first year.) Matt persisted developing a niche helping young families who wanted life insurance and whose incomes would grow over time giving them more money to invest. He can still recall two phone calls early in his career when he learned that two of his clients both husbands had died in tragic accidents. Matt usually recommends that clients buy enough life insurance so that the payouts could replace the client’s income if the client were to die. Because these clients had followed Matt’s advice Matt knew that the widows would not have to worry much about money. *** Matt Chris Rich and Randy all talk about the importance of building trusting relationships—crucial when dealing with a subject as sensitive and as personal as money. Christin a new certified financial planner who worked for many years as Rich’s assistant has sat in on hundreds of client meetings. She says there’s no particular technique or sales strategy involved in building trust. “Rich is just really very genuine and very much himself. He cares about the client first and foremost.”  Christin Rose This kind of care flows from a question that both Rich and Randy ask all their clients: “What do you want?” “The most important part of my job is spending time understanding the client” Rich says. “Money is just a means to something. What do you want to do with your money? Do you want to educate your children? Retire? Give money to charity? One question I ask almost everybody is ‘If you won $10 million in the lottery what would you do?’ The answers tell me a lot about how the client thinks about money.” Randy puts it like this: “You have to help people get what they want. ‘What do you want?’ ‘Where are you at?’ ‘How can we close the gap?’ It’s that simple. That’s the story that gets played out over and over again.” It may be a simple tune but humming it repeatedly seems to work. Over the years Healy Group has helped many hundreds of clients and accomplished more besides providing for the families of the employees and owners. The company has allowed Chris Rich Matt and Tim the freedom to serve as branch coordinators taking phone calls during the workday if need be. It has created jobs for community members and locals in an environment marked by fun friendship and service. There are birthday honorings a chili cook-off an annual trip to a South Bend Cubs baseball game talks on right speech service projects and plenty of prayer. “It’s a very positive environment” says Linda. “People care. The leaders have a vision. Being in a Christian environment your hope is not in your job it’s in the Lord. I think that helps keep things in perspective.”  Tim Pingel and Randy Raciti chatted at the most recent Fun & Fellowship Friday event. Regarding perspective Randy recalls a conversation with Rich that began as a discussion of standard business metrics: revenue profit and the growth of the company. Then Rich abruptly changed the topic. “I think we should just focus on what the Lord wants us to do with the relationships we have and just continue to respond to the Holy Spirit and keep taking steps” Rich said. The owners do not want to grow just for growth’s sake as Chris explains but in a way that is organic and in keeping with God’s desires for the company. Prayer is key. “We pray that the Lord sends us good people to work for us and helps us pick up good clients.” “The story of Abraham serves as a good guide for us” Randy says for Abraham proved “faithful in small things” and became the father of many.  Employees take turns preparing food each month. Matt Geary and Terry Graber grilled."
20201009023931,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=6671,July 11 2018 5:54 p.m.,The People of Praise Responds to Recent Press,Children play at a People of Praise block party in Shreveport. (Photo by Andy Bowar) Contact: Sean Connolly [email protected] Over the past few weeks the People of Praise has received a great deal of attention in the press. With this document we aim to correct the record and provide clarity on a few important points. The Covenant of the People of Praise After a multi-year period of prayer and discernment many People of Praise members choose to make a permanent commitment called a covenant. The covenant of the People of Praise is a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another. The covenant is not an oath or a vow. (Despite what has been reported in the press over our 47-year history we have never publicly or privately described the covenant as an oath or a vow.) Our covenant is a commitment to be there for one another for the long run to support one another through thick and thin through all of life's seasons. Of course we understand that God can always call a person to another way of life. Ecumenical Witness While a majority of People of Praise members are Catholic the People of Praise is not a Catholic group. Our membership includes not only Catholics but Lutherans Anglicans Methodists Pentecostals and nondenominational Christians among others. We aim to be a witness to the unity Jesus desires for all his followers. What we share is a common baptism a commitment to love one another and our experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual Direction & Headship Each person in the People of Praise has another qualified community member from whom they can receive practical and spiritual advice and encouragement.  This trusted confidant is called a head. Particularly with newer members heads also act as guides in how we live together in Christian community. This practice has puzzled some observers since the vast majority of our members are not ordained clergy. Pope Francis himself addressed this issue in 2015 stating “Spiritual direction is not an exclusive charism of the presbyters: it is a charism of the laity!” He cited a long tradition of lay spiritual direction going back to the early monastic era. In keeping with this tradition the People of Praise uses the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as a basis for counsel and discernment. Heads do not make decisions for others but are there to help each person to discern freely what they should do in the Lord. Spiritual direction is a time-honored practice among Catholics. Many Protestants also have a history of entering into agreements with their religious communities. While always honoring individual freedom and conscience Christians hold each other accountable through commitments they make to small groups prayer partners interdenominational faith-based organizations and churches. Freedom People of Praise members are always free to follow their consciences as formed by the light of reason experience and the teachings of their churches. Each person is responsible for his or her own decisions. “Handmaids” The People of Praise has both men and women leaders. For many years we referred to some of our women leaders as handmaids following the use of the term by Mary Jesus’s mother who called herself “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk. 1:38). Mary is honored by millions as the first Christian and as a model believer. In keeping with this the term handmaid originally honored a woman with an important relationship with God and a leadership role within our community. Recognizing that the meaning of this term has shifted dramatically in our culture in recent years we no longer use the term handmaid to describe those women who are leaders in the People of Praise. The People of Praise began using the term handmaid in the 1970s well before Margaret Atwood wrote her famous novel (1985). The People of Praise community was not the inspiration for Ms. Atwood’s work. Politics and the Sanctity of Life The People of Praise does not take positions on political matters legislation or constitutional interpretation. We subscribe to the position of the Roman Catholic church and many Protestant churches namely we respect the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The People of Praise includes political liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats and independents. We strive to be one of those rare places in 21st-century life where men and women with a wide variety of political and religious views can live together in harmony. Public Policy Issues and the People of Praise Joe Zakas who has served as a state senator in Indiana for 36 years offered the following statement: “I joined the People of Praise in 1972. I was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1982. In all my years as a legislator I was never directed in any way as to any vote or public policy issue. Taking personal responsibility for decisions and actions was the bottom line.” Men Women and Marriage The People of Praise recognizes that men and women share a fundamental equality as bearers of God’s image and sons of God in Christ.  “[Y]ou are all sons of God through faith for all of you were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28). We also take seriously the teaching of the New Testament that husbands and wives should love one another and lay down their lives out of love for one another and their families (Jn. 15:13). Husbands should not be domineering nor should wives be servile. No member of the People of Praise should be either domineering or servile in their relationships with other people. Leadership should always be for the benefit of others as Jesus showed and marriages should be marked by mutual love and cooperation between spouses. Of course every individual should always act in personal freedom and with responsibility including within marriages. Each married couple is unique and distinctive so how this works out in the husband-wife relationship will be different for each couple. Within the community we find a natural support for marriages and families. Many community children grow up as close friends and their mothers and fathers find friendship encouragement and insight from other community members. Marriages in the community have an incredibly low divorce rate. Leadership & Governance The highest authority in the People of Praise is the board of governors. An overall coordinator leads the community and is responsible to the board of governors for his work. Board members and the overall coordinator have terms of office and term limits. When making decisions about especially important matters the board of governors seeks input and opinions from all community members through a direct consultation. Currently the overall coordinator of the People of Praise is Craig S. Lent Ph.D. a professor of engineering and physics at the University of Notre Dame. Endorsements and Commentary Cardinal Francis George O.M.I Archbishop of Chicago (died 2015):“In my acquaintance with the People of Praise I have found men and women dedicated to God and eager to seek and do His divine will. They are shaped by love of Holy Scripture prayer and community; and the Church’s mission is richer for their presence.”Patricia Heaton Actress (Twitter July 3 2018):“[They are] faithful Christians who have committed their lives to loving the poor as Jesus commanded of his followers…”Mona Charen (National Review July 5 2018):“The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably inter-racial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. . . . Considering their charitable work and trans-racial trans-class appeal they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. ”O. Carter Snead Director of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture (Wall Street Journal July 6 2018.):“Through my interactions over the years I’ve found that these are lovely earnest people who want to build an intentional community for the purpose of loving and serving others…”Mary Hasson Ethics and Public Policy Center (Washington Post July 7 2018):“What I see in practice is people who take their Christian faith and their intention to share life with others seriously. There is a tremendous ethic of serving and caring for others. Someone who loses a job or gets sick members are there that’s what it looks like to me as someone who is looking from outside.”Bishop Peter Smith auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Oregon (Catholic News Agency July 3 2018):“My People of Praise affiliation was very clear in my consideration for appointment as bishop so the Holy Father Pope Francis appointed me bishop knowing full well my involvement with People of Praise.”

(Credit: Linda Coney) Lloyd Mehaffey began serving as the principal branch coordinator for the New Orleans branch on June 15. He follows Mike Coney who has served for two consecutive six-year terms as PBC. Mike continues to serve on the community's board of governors and as the coordinator responsible for the Biloxi Mobile and Shreveport branches. He says he is looking forward to serving the New Orleans branch however he can in the future. “Lloyd is an experienced branch coordinator” says Kevin Ranaghan chair of the branch relations council. “I have always been impressed by his deep understanding of our community life which will be a big help to him and the other brothers and sisters.” Born and raised in New Orleans Lloyd has been a member of the branch since it became part of the People of Praise in 1986. Lloyd and his wife Kathy were also members of the group that preceded it the Community of Jesus the King. During his years at Hendrix College in Conway AR Lloyd started interdenominational prayer meetings on campus and did street witnessing in nearby Little Rock. “I always thought the Lord was ecumenical so why shouldn’t I be the same way?” he asks with a laugh. In the last few months Lloyd Kathy and other branch members have occasionally visited a local park to evangelize and pray with strangers. As vice-president and part owner of Mehaffey & Daigle Inc. he sells industrial raw materials to plastics pharmaceuticals and chemicals companies in five states which requires a day trip every week or two. Lloyd and Kathy have six children ages 15-30 (Dan Kathleen Stacy Emily Shannon and Megan) two still at home. He has a strong baritone voice and for many years Lloyd sang in the branch’s music ministry. “I am extremely happy Lloyd will lead us” says Bill Wiltz (New Orleans). “He’s a one-of-a-kind guy and one of the main reasons I’m in the People of Praise. He’s never too busy to help and was on the phone with me almost every day of the nine months we were out of our home due to Hurricane Katrina.” During Mike Coney’s twelve years as head of the branch Hurricane Katrina was a defining moment says Tom Evans (New Orleans).  “I clearly remember our first branch meeting after Katrina. We had all been dispersed over several states for about six weeks. It was Mike who contacted us all to ‘Come on home’ for a Lord’s Day celebration and community meeting at his home which had escaped flooding. All of us who could make it did and we had a joyous reunion everybody catching up on everybody else’s stories. It was a wonderful moment for us all and Mike presided.” Branch member Phil Slattery notes that Mike has always been a strong leader in the branch. ""And after serving as a coordinator for around 20 years Mike isn’t looking forward to a rest but for one more way to serve.” Kevin says that Mike wears many hats very well: husband father grandfather deacon lawyer and coordinator. “He combines wisdom with a pastoral gift that is life-giving. He has a passion for branch unity that was very evident in the aftermath of Katrina. We’re fortunate that he will continue to serve on the board of governors and with his wife Linda on the branch relations team.” Branch member Elaine Chetta comments that Mike is very generous man using his time and talents for God’s glory. Her husband Nick agrees pointing out the time Mike opened his house up to their family during Hurricane Georges in 1998. “Mike did a great job and I trust Lloyd to do the same” adds Tucky Argus. ""I’m very peaceful grateful and happy in this time of change."""
20201009065104,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8265,Oct. 2 2020 3:53 p.m.,This is Praise Harvest,﻿ Enjoy this video showcasing Praise Harvest the urban farm managed by People of Praise members who live on the South Side of Evansville IN. Over the past several years People of Praise members have been converting vacant city lots and their own backyards into gardens with the aim of providing fresh food for their neighborhood. This year to date the farm has grown over 6000 lbs of produce. Among the harvest: garlic onions swiss chard spinach tomatoes eggplant carrots green beans black eyed peas okra sweet potatoes cucumbers watermelon zinnias and most beloved by the neighborhood greens--collard mustard and turnip. Most of the yield goes to a farm stand that Praise Harvest runs every Saturday morning throughout the growing season on the corner of one of their farm lots. There's no cost for the produce though there's a suggested donation of $1/lb for people who can afford it.   The farmers consult with their neighbors about food they’d like to see grown. Early on there were resounding requests for greens which continue to be by far the most popular item. “We regularly run out of greens” says farm manager John Earhart. Last season the farm grew 3800 lbs of greens alone.  When the farm stand opens at 9am there are typically 10 or 12 cars already lined up waiting. The team that sells the vegetables has developed a system that allows for social distancing and safe transactions.  But the farm stand has proven to be a gathering place for the neighborhood especially during the pandemic. Neighbors come for fresh produce and stick around to visit and catch up. “I think people are really happy just to have an opportunity to be together” says Nick Holovaty.  To learn more about Praise Harvest visit https://www.facebook.com/praiseharvestfarm.

20201010181100,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=8012,July 15 2020 10:33 a.m.,A School Year Like No Other,The Greenlawn campus set up for the commencement celebration. Photo by Tess Cassady. By Catherine Bulger with reporting by Kathryn Elliott On a muggy Friday evening in early June Trinity School at Greenlawn faculty members welcomed carloads of graduating seniors and their families onto campus directing them to parking spots along the long lane that runs through the property. Rows of balloon-festooned signs bearing seniors’ names decked the lawn flanking a small tent with a speaker’s lectern. A ring of carefully spaced chairs held faculty and staff. With everyone in place Greenlawn’s first outdoor commencement ceremony commenced.  Two Graduate Award winners gave an opening prayer and a valedictory (the Graduate Award is Trinity School’s highest award). Then each cap-and-gowned senior walked from the cars to stand next to his or her sign. Head of School John Lee closed the condensed ceremony with a brief address. Each senior received gifts prepared by the faculty: a personalized coffee mug a bound booklet of the traditional faculty honorings. a copy of James Joyce’s The Dead and a makeshift diploma because the real ones weren’t available yet—the company that makes them had been closed due to the coronavirus.

In Virginia local officials changed the regulations the day before Trinity School at Meadow View’s commencement allowing for outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people. Capitalizing on this freedom the seniors sat outside six feet apart with their families remaining in their parked cars. There was no commencement speaker because the event came together so quickly but the school decided to present three Graduate Awards instead of the usual two and each recipient gave an address. The graduating seniors walked across the outdoor stage to receive their diplomas. As the seniors departed other students lined the road in their cars to honk them out into the world.  Steve Hendrickson and Beth Schmitz preside over River Ridge's parking lot graduation. Photo by Bob Cunningham. At Trinity School at River Ridge the seniors received their diplomas in drive-through fashion as they entered campus. Seniors families and faculty positioned their cars throughout the large parking lot and stayed inside them for the ceremony. A radio transmitter broadcast the proceedings to all the parked cars. Car horns blared joyfully. Graduates poked their heads out of sunroofs to talk to their classmates. Dr. David Odde a biochemist at the University of Minnesota gave a commencement address. When the new graduates departed the faculty lined their cars into a triumphal corridor for them to pass through. “A lot of the graduates sat on top of cars myself included” said River Ridge senior Abby Theis. “We were able to take off our hats and wave them around.” “We joked about our senior gift being a giant hand sanitizer bottle that said ‘In memory of the class of 2020.’”*** Distance learning at Trinity began in mid-March. When it became clear that the rest of the semester would be held off campus conversations began about how to manage the end of the school year with its numerous traditions and activities and above all graduation. The three heads of school and the deans consulted the seniors and their parents.“They gave us a couple of options. We can do graduation next year or do it in August and a lot of people didn’t like either of these ideas” said Greenlawn senior Julia Zusi. In the end all three schools settled on their variation of an outdoor commencement in June.  Faculty members welcome graduating seniors and family to Greenlawn's campus. Photo by Tess Cassady. Normally Trinity hosts a dinner the night before commencement for faculty seniors and parents. Each senior is individually honored by one of the teachers. River Ridge Head of School Beth Schmitz said “One of the things seniors and parents expressed was really wanting to hear their classmates honored.” So instead of a dinner together River Ridge moved the honorings to a Zoom gathering. Another popular tradition near the end of the term at Trinity is morning prayer sharings given by the seniors. River Ridge was able to move those online as well. At Greenlawn the seniors wrote their sharings and recorded themselves giving them and they were sent to the student body in an email. Meadow View created a webpage to host the spring fine arts events that normally populate May evenings at Trinity. The website featured recordings of ninth- and tenth-grade musical compositions dramatic monologues by the senior drama students photos of senior artwork and a virtual choir produced by the music teacher.  Meadow View faculty delivered gift boxes to the graduating seniors at their homes. Photo courtesy of TSMV. Because the second senior drama production was cancelled Greenlawn decided to broadcast two readers’ theaters as Zoom video recordings that premiered on YouTube with each actor reading his or her part from home. To replace the Greenlawn spring fine arts night the two art teachers compiled a slideshow of all the eighth-grade and senior artwork. At River Ridge three long-serving faculty members retired: Penny Arndt Debby Salmon and Mary Radtke. Among them they have over 70 years of teaching experience at Trinity School. Penny has been dean of girls since the school began in 1987. Beth says it was very hard not to be able to honor them in person but they were able to celebrate the teachers at a virtual end-of-year ceremony on the last day of class. Likewise Greenlawn had two retiring faculty members to honor: Marge Connolly a long-time Humane Letters Seminar teacher and Tom Finke who helped found the school and served as its head from 1981-83 then again from 2002-04 and is moving from teaching to administration. The faculty honored them at a lunch (with tables spaced out for social distancing) the week after school ended.***All the end-of-year celebrations and activities happened on top of the many weeks of pivoting the normal Trinity spring curriculum to an online scaled-back format. John said “The instinct among the faculty was to achieve everything we normally achieve which was great and admirable but also impossible.” Most classes met online via Zoom two or three times a week (instead of daily) for about half the usual amount of class time per day. Teachers and students all needed to learn the technology. Ramping up the pressure some students were sharing computers with siblings and with parents working from home. The school decided to make courses pass/fail and cut back on the normal workload. Julia described her typical day. “I started with personal morning prayer worked out for an hour and then started schoolwork or had class. I would pace while I was reading or jump on the trampoline for 10 minutes in between subjects. Having classes and having morning prayer planned out helped me have a real schedule which was a struggle for the first three weeks.” She added “Most of the senior girls were working six to eight hours a day most of it on the computer. I sometimes get minor migraines that are light-induced so the screen time was hard for me but there’s a nightlight feature that filters out a certain kind of light that bothers people’s eyes.”  A Meadow View student performs a frog dissection from home with classmates on Zoom. Photo courtesy of TSMV. The teachers had to adapt their teaching styles dramatically. Lynda Seasly who teaches girls’ math at Greenlawn learned how to use an iPad so she could do problems in real time on the screen for her students. Mary Radtke who taught Scripture (among other things) at River Ridge would put reflection questions in the Google Classroom group chat. At Meadow View Tim Dusenbury recorded himself reading several chapters of Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov out loud for his students to follow along. Marge Connolly learned how to record short videos and upload them to YouTube so that she could explain difficult terms and concepts without wasting precious minutes of class time. Maintaining motivation to get schoolwork done alone at home was another challenge. Ben Bagiackas a Greenlawn senior said “Because the classes were pass/fail it was much more the guys in my class holding one another to a higher standard. We told each other to put in the effort for the sake of the effort.” Meadow View Head of School Kay Yohe commented “I was very proud of the extent the students kept up with really rigorous material when it was pass/fail. The vast majority of them really hung in there.” “Some subjects got harder” said Joe Whelpley a sophomore at Meadow View. “The new concepts in precalculus were difficult like inequality in matrices. Setting it up was harder because we couldn’t do it on our calculators together. You can’t really troubleshoot a friend’s calculator inputs on Zoom.” On the other hand he added “Chemistry was pretty unchanged. Other classes like Latin and New Testament were unchanged. They’re either translation or reading.” But Joe added that the hardest part of distance learning was missing classmates. “The best part about school—that was taken away from us—was the camaraderie. Seeing them on Zoom was not enough. We would text and say ‘I miss you guys.’ We would try to call one another but it can be hard to coordinate.”  Avy Flory a junior from Meadow View won the competition at The Dailies to recreate a famous work of art. Avy recreated a self portrait by Frida Kahlo. Abby agreed. “We had a goose chase (scavenger hunt) where we had to take pictures and send them in and we were in teams and that really helped. But other than that I didn’t get to see my friends much outside of class and that was hard. Not being able to talk to our teachers or the students was just really difficult.” Trinity Schools President Jon Balsbaugh led the charge in formulating distance learning throughout the difficult months striving to improve the experience. Among other things he created The Dailies—a cross-campus forum to share art music poetry and competitions such as kite-flying and Rube Goldberg competitions. The Dailies’ purpose was purely fun and love of learning. In a letter to the students explaining The Dailies Jon wrote “I encourage you to take time during the day especially to appreciate and respond to beauty. Read the poems and take them to heart. Don’t just glance at the artworks interact with them. And go to a quiet place close your eyes and listen to the pieces of music. Beauty will not be rushed.” “It was a really nice chance to have something that’s not in my normal curriculum” said Maggie Kocon a ninth-grader at River Ridge. “I got a taste of what younger and older students are thinking across all the Trinity Schools.”***There’s no denying distance learning was hard on students and faculty and parents alike. “Everybody’s tired and beat up” said John Lee. “I think people were more mentally and psychologically tired—more mental energy gets used up to keep focus in a way that’s not necessary when you’re rubbing up against people day to day.” Beth Schmitz added “One thing distance learning did was cast a spotlight on things we take for granted every day like 30-second conversations and just being together.”  River Ridge graduating seniors celebrate atop their cars. Photo by Bob Cunningham. Julia reflected “You go through all the grades thinking about what your last day will look like. Our class never had a field day [as seniors] because fall field day was also cancelled. It was really disappointing. But we still had really good Humane Letters conversations. We still had a final math project and figured out how to make small groups work together. I think [the school] did a good job of making sure we were able to still do all the big things.” Abby added “I’m not sure I would want to do it again but there was a lot of beauty in it.” “I saw the Lord in my students suffering” Marge Connolly said. “And it was a real suffering for them especially the seniors—what they had to give up and lay aside which was really important to them.” All of that may explain why there was such a release of joy as students faculty and parents gathered together in parking lots and on the lawn to celebrate the seniors and their completion of a Trinity School education to celebrate the completion of several months of a Trinity School education as it has never been done before.
20201010224934,https://peopleofpraise.org/news/?p=5628,Jan. 13 2017 2:32 p.m.,Kerry Koller to Step Down As President of Trinity Schools,From Craig Lent Overall Coordinator of the People of Praise and Chairman of the Board of Trustees Trinity Schools Inc.: Dear Brothers and Sisters After 36 years of service and visionary leadership Dr. Kerry Koller has decided to step down from his position as president of Trinity Schools Inc. His resignation will take effect in the summer of 2017. The Trinity Schools board of trustees has already begun the difficult task of choosing his replacement.  Kerry has filled the role of president since 1981 when we opened the doors of the first Trinity School in South Bend. Through his guiding vision we have grown from a small community of learners in a rented church hall to one that includes three campuses two member schools and more than 2000 alumni. Trinity’s reputation for academic excellence has expanded nationally and our model has provided the foundation for two member schools Trinity Academy in Portland and The Wilberforce School in Princeton New Jersey as well as more than a dozen public charter schools in Arizona Texas and Colorado including the Thomas Maclaren School in Colorado Springs. Our three campuses have earned a total of seven Blue Ribbon awards from the U.S. Department of Education. Of Trinity at Greenlawn the late author and political thinker Russell Kirk said “I know of no better school in these United States.” I want to offer Kerry my most heartfelt thanks for his enormous contributions to Trinity and his decades of hard work on behalf of all of us. Kerry has met the daily challenges of leading and growing Trinity Schools with constant cheerfulness and a deep joy laboring faithfully out of love for our covenant and a desire to bring the blessings of a Trinity education to as many people as possible. Kerry has a great love of seminars and many of us have experienced his brilliant insights into books and his deep openness to the ideas of others stemming from his core belief that truth is more easily discovered in a community. Fortunately Kerry has agreed to stay on as Trinity’s president emeritus and he will advise the next president of Trinity Schools in the execution of his or her responsibilities. In the coming months I hope that many of us can have the chance to thank and honor Kerry. Kerry’s love of a good discussion goes back to his days as a high school student in San Francisco when he would listen in as his father’s friends a collection of philosophers and theologians debated the big issues of their day. He attended St. Mary’s College of California where he read the Great Books and learned to appreciate classical music while living in the home of Dr. Ronald McArthur who went on to found Thomas Aquinas College. Kerry and Barbara moved to South Bend in 1963 where Kerry attended the University of Notre Dame earning his Ph.D. in philosophy. At that time he met Paul DeCelles Kevin Ranaghan and Clem Walters who eventually became his friends and fellow leaders in the community and at Trinity. In 1969 the Kollers moved back to San Francisco where they and others founded the John the Baptist Charismatic Renewal Community eventually returning to South Bend and joining the People of Praise with many others who moved from San Francisco. I would be remiss if I did not also mention the long service Barbara has given to our mission at Trinity in her many years as a teacher and admissions director and in her willingness to move not once but twice along with Kerry as the Kollers helped lay the foundations for the River Ridge and Meadow View campuses. The Kollers have five children all Trinity School graduates: Katherine Brophy ‘85 (Colorado Springs) Stephen ‘87 (South Bend) Jack ‘92 Elizabeth Adams ‘95 (northern Virginia) and Peter ‘95. Tom Finke (South Bend) a founding faculty member whose relationship with Kerry goes back to the 1970s says Kerry’s biggest contributions to Trinity include “constantly holding up the Trinity vision” and developing the Humane Letters Seminar courses which remain close to Kerry’s heart. “These are things that make Trinity Trinity” he said. Bridget Donohue (South Bend) a longtime teacher and administrator said “I could tell tons of stories about Kerry but I think they would all reflect the fact that he simply has the Trinity School mission in his blood. For him it’s not a job. It’s a life.” Paul DeCelles (South Bend) added “Kerry has been a brilliant leader for Trinity Schools. Trinity’s educational model has been widely admired and copied numerous times. The ripple effects of his work go on and on.” Some of those ripples include the many wonderful missionaries that Trinity has produced making possible the community’s mission work in the Mississippi Valley. Kay Yohe (northern Virginia) head of school at Meadow View praised Kerry’s ability to freely follow a line of inquiry wherever it leads encouraging others to do the same. Jon Balsbaugh (Servant Branch) the head of school at River Ridge and John Lee (South Bend) head of school at Greenlawn both pointed to Kerry as the model of a lifelong learner with a wide range of interests. “As long as I have known him Kerry has continued to pursue a deeper understanding of the world searching for the truth—whether in science poetry fiction or philosophy” Jon said. Kerry says he is looking forward to serving Trinity School and the community by reading thinking and writing which he expects to have more time for in the coming years. “I am so thankful to the Lord for leading Barbara and me to the People of Praise. I was blessed to be guided by Paul Kevin and others as we considered what we were convinced was a leading from the Lord to try something new to educate our own children and the children of other families who would be attracted by our mission. I've had the opportunity to be the head of school at each of our schools to converse with and work alongside three marvelous faculties and to teach at each school myself along with Barbara. After all of this who knows what more the Lord has in mind?”

If you have a suggestion for a future story in this series please contact us at [email protected] ""You can be the best financial advisor in the world but if you don’t have a client it doesn’t matter. You’ll starve to death.” Rich Preuss a financial advisor and an owner of Healy Group in South Bend is telling me about the days when he cut his teeth as a salesman. In 1982 Rich was a young man with a master’s degree in theology who wanted to become a stockbroker. After Merrill Lynch rejected him Ed Healy a life insurance agent offered Rich a job. (Rich went on to marry Ed’s daughter Beth though Ed didn’t know about their budding relationship when he hired Rich.)   Rich Preuss The job involved lots of cold calling. “Ed gave me these 3x5 Dun & Bradstreet cards which listed a business its owner and the sales of the company and he said ‘Call these people.’” He aimed to make 50 calls each week. On the phone he would ask for a face-to-face meeting. If he got a yes he’d bring along an experienced salesman and listen to the pitch studying points of tension and connection. “Trying to get new clients is brutal psychologically” he says. “When I started out I probably thought about quitting every day for the first five years.” He put his hope in a formula—if he made 10 calls he could get two or three meetings and land one client. It was the spirit of Babe Ruth the baseball legend who set the record for home runs while simultaneously setting the record for strikeouts. “So much of building a business and getting clients comes down to what you do each day” he says. “It’s a matter of calling people and doing the little things. As the saying goes when you do the little things the big things take care of themselves.”***   Joe Cramer Built on the little things Healy Group is much larger today than it was in the 1980s—with 41 employees spread across four divisions. The life insurance work that Rich began with morphed into a broader financial planning division employing Rich Randy Raciti and Matt Urbanski plus community members Christin Rose Joe Cramer Linda Mooney and Claire Mysliwiec and five other employees. Chris Rowland leads a separate division with 12 employees focused on employee benefits. Another community member Tim Pingel works in the insurance division. The mortgage division is led by Mike Morin a Trinity School at Greenlawn parent.  Linda Mooney Growth did not come fast but it has accelerated recently. “It took us 23 years to get to 10 employees” says Randy Healy Group’s president noting that in 2015 the company added 10 employees in a single year. In 2014 they moved into their new 12000-square-foot office building which they designed with extra space so that growth can continue.  Pam Shultz *** Randy started at Healy in 1987. The son of a salesman and entrepreneur who died when Randy was 13 Randy always wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps as a businessman. But by 1987 his career had reached a turning point so he took a walk with Joel Kibler (Vancouver-Portland). “I have this sense that you and Rich Preuss should be working together” Joel told Randy who applied for a job at Healy. He started by selling employee benefits packages and helping individual clients with financial planning. Randy is a dogged worker—as a young man he would rise at 4:00 a.m. and work until midnight then get up and do it all over again. He’s also a born salesman. “I am very comfortable picking up the phone and introducing myself” he says. In 1990 Randy entered a leadership program and when the classes ended he contacted all 45 of his classmates. “Presidents of banks presidents of hospitals presidents of media companies— I contacted them all. I didn’t know any better. I was 29 years old so why not?” On the phone he would offer to take his prospect out to breakfast or lunch. Then over the meal Randy would spend most of the time perhaps 40 minutes listening to his prospect’s story waiting patiently until the final 10 minutes when he would tell his own story and offer his services. He and Rich were both aggressive about adding new clients. “One year we had a little personal competition for how many new people we could meet with in the course of a year and I think we both blew through the 200 new people mark” Randy says.  Claire Mysliwiec enjoyed a Dairy Queen Dilly Bar provided by Tim Pingel known for offering ice cream treats to his fellow employees. To help their clients Randy and Rich began using a software program to forecast the amount clients needed to save for retirement. Most appointments were outside the office so they would bring a 70- or 80-page printed report with scenarios and projections. Inevitably the client would want to alter the variables—to see the impact of saving more or working longer— so the advisor had to return to the office and rerun the numbers. “That created frustration for us and for the client” Rich says. Over time the software improved and Rich and Randy began meeting with clients at the Healy Group office where they could run projections on the spot. They also started using a more comprehensive planning process analyzing a client’s overall level of protection debt savings and investments. With a more complete picture they noticed ways to save the client money. By 1999 Randy’s efforts had begun to blossom and he wanted to go full-time as a financial planner. Enter Chris Rowland. *** Chris had been working in employee benefits since 1985 when he graduated from Notre Dame with his M.B.A. As an undergrad he had majored in philosophy but had developed an interest in business. In graduate school he first learned about the up-and-coming field of employee benefits. A young married man he saw a chance to do good for people while also providing for his family. He worked for two different companies in South Bend before joining Healy in 1999 to take over and eventually expand Randy’s employee benefits portfolio. “The mindset that we’re helping build the kingdom of God when we take care of people that we’ll go above and beyond the call of duty—that attracted me” Chris says. Employee benefits work has different rhythms from financial planning. Most of Chris’s clients are businesses—small companies nonprofits and larger corporations. Chris and his staff of 12 act as middle men between the companies who sell group health life and disability insurance packages and the companies providing insurance to their employees. They negotiate contracts offer ideas and answer questions. Health insurance costs are always rising and regulations changing so a lot of the work Chris and his team does is educational—teaching human resources departments about changes in the marketplace teaching employees about changes to their plans. “We want to work hard for our clients to make sure problems are resolved and that they can afford to offer health insurance to their employees” he says.  Employees at a monthly Fun & Fellowship Friday lunch in Healy’s community room. *** If phone calls and sales efforts are the skeleton of the business then faceto-face client meetings are the heart and soul. They are where the music happens where “we take on our clients’ problems as if they’re our own problems” as Chris puts it. Even if the problem is a flat tire. Healy Group employees like to tell the story of a client who rolled into the parking lot on just three good tires. Tim Pingel spotted the flat and in a meeting he and Rich were having with the client Tim asked the client for his keys. He asked at least twice before the surprised client agreed. Tim went out to the parking lot found the jack and spare raised up the metal hulk switched the tire then lowered the minivan back down to the ground while Rich finished meeting with the client.  Employees spiritedly entered into a Friday fun game: identifying fellow employees from their baby pictures. Matt Urbanski tells another story about driving to Bremen Indiana to visit an elderly couple he advises. On the way there he remembered that the husband loves chocolates so he decided to stop at a grocery store and buy some. Praying while he drove he asked the Lord what he thought. Much to Matt’s surprise the Lord prompted him to buy some paczkis instead. (Paczkis are a Polish pastry.) Matt showed up with the paczkis only to learn that the wife had been hankering for some all day. In fact when Matt had called earlier she thought about asking him to bring some but dismissed the idea as too trivial. Later Matt prayed with the husband for arthritis in his hands and the wife for neck pain. Both told him they experienced relief after his prayer. Matt is Healy’s newest owner. He started in 2000 but only after putting off the idea for several years. As a college student in the early 1990s he met with Rich to ask his advice about whether to major in finance or marketing. “I don’t think it matters” Rich told him “because we’ll hire you whatever you major in.” Matt chose marketing worked for a restaurant ownership group then led the development office at Holy Cross College. By 2000 he was ready to try insurance sales and financial planning. He says his first year at Healy did not go well at least by conventional measures. He worked harder than he ever had but he brought in less income than he had in his previous job. (Several years later someone told him that 90 percent of financial advisors quit in their first year.) Matt persisted developing a niche helping young families who wanted life insurance and whose incomes would grow over time giving them more money to invest. He can still recall two phone calls early in his career when he learned that two of his clients both husbands had died in tragic accidents. Matt usually recommends that clients buy enough life insurance so that the payouts could replace the client’s income if the client were to die. Because these clients had followed Matt’s advice Matt knew that the widows would not have to worry much about money. *** Matt Chris Rich and Randy all talk about the importance of building trusting relationships—crucial when dealing with a subject as sensitive and as personal as money. Christin a new certified financial planner who worked for many years as Rich’s assistant has sat in on hundreds of client meetings. She says there’s no particular technique or sales strategy involved in building trust. “Rich is just really very genuine and very much himself. He cares about the client first and foremost.”  Christin Rose This kind of care flows from a question that both Rich and Randy ask all their clients: “What do you want?” “The most important part of my job is spending time understanding the client” Rich says. “Money is just a means to something. What do you want to do with your money? Do you want to educate your children? Retire? Give money to charity? One question I ask almost everybody is ‘If you won $10 million in the lottery what would you do?’ The answers tell me a lot about how the client thinks about money.” Randy puts it like this: “You have to help people get what they want. ‘What do you want?’ ‘Where are you at?’ ‘How can we close the gap?’ It’s that simple. That’s the story that gets played out over and over again.” It may be a simple tune but humming it repeatedly seems to work. Over the years Healy Group has helped many hundreds of clients and accomplished more besides providing for the families of the employees and owners. The company has allowed Chris Rich Matt and Tim the freedom to serve as branch coordinators taking phone calls during the workday if need be. It has created jobs for community members and locals in an environment marked by fun friendship and service. There are birthday honorings a chili cook-off an annual trip to a South Bend Cubs baseball game talks on right speech service projects and plenty of prayer. “It’s a very positive environment” says Linda. “People care. The leaders have a vision. Being in a Christian environment your hope is not in your job it’s in the Lord. I think that helps keep things in perspective.”  Tim Pingel and Randy Raciti chatted at the most recent Fun & Fellowship Friday event. Regarding perspective Randy recalls a conversation with Rich that began as a discussion of standard business metrics: revenue profit and the growth of the company. Then Rich abruptly changed the topic. “I think we should just focus on what the Lord wants us to do with the relationships we have and just continue to respond to the Holy Spirit and keep taking steps” Rich said. The owners do not want to grow just for growth’s sake as Chris explains but in a way that is organic and in keeping with God’s desires for the company. Prayer is key. “We pray that the Lord sends us good people to work for us and helps us pick up good clients.” “The story of Abraham serves as a good guide for us” Randy says for Abraham proved “faithful in small things” and became the father of many.
